As Pt Adhi Commuter Properti Tbk Adcp And Pt Semacom Integrated Tbk Sema Sucor Sekuritas Analyst Paulus Jimmy Highlighted That The Company S Fundamentals And Valuation Are Crucial Factors When Trading On The Stock Market But There Is Another Important Thing That Should Not Be Forgotten, Namely The Story Story Is Considered Important Because It Relates To Public Interest In Understanding The Issuer S Profile, Strategy, And Business Prospects In The Future Therefore, Jimmy Believes That Not All Issuers Whose Prices Fell After The Ipo Have Poor Fundamentals And Valuations It Could Be Because Of The Low Interest Of Investors In The Stories From These Issuers It Should Be Understood That The Story Of Every Industry Has A Cycle What Is Not Interesting Today, Tomorrow Could Be Interesting, Said Jimmy When Contacted By Kontan Co Id, Tuesday 19 7 Technical Analyst Binaartha Sekuritas Ivan Rosanova Added That Sectoral Sentiment Could Also Influence The Direction Of Stocks After The Ipo It Could Be That Market Players Relinquish Ownership After The Ipo Because They Are Looking At Other Stocks That Are Considered More Attractive For Now Also Read After The Ipo, Chemstar Chem Expands The Market To The Cosmetics And F B Segment Vice Versa With Stocks Whose Prices Are Already Burning Considering The Recent Market Fluctuations, In The Short Term There Is A Chance For A Correction To Occur But As Long As The Issuer S Performance And Business Prospects Are Still Positive, Investors Tend To Accumulate Rather Than Profit Taking, So The Price Is Relatively Maintained Even So, Ivan Reminded Him To Be Careful When Entering Into New Stocks Whose Prices Have Soared Considerably It S Better To Wait For The Release Of The Performance, Especially If The Valuation Is Quite High, Especially For Stocks That Have Not Experienced A Significant Correction, Said Ivan In The Midst Of A Market Trend That Is Prone To Selling Pressure, Ivan Suggested That The Portion Of The Investment Portfolio Is Also Directed To Bigcap Stocks For Now, It S Best Not To Be Aggressive While Observing Market Developments Take Advantage Of Every Rebound To Get Short Term Profits While Slowly Filling The Portfolio

For This Year, Nico Sees Non Cyclical Consumers, Healthcare, Commodities, And Energy As Still Attractive Sectors To Look At Meanwhile, Mnc Sekuritas Technical Analyst Herditya Wicaksana Favors The

126,20/Jul/2022 00:00:00,20/Jul/2022 14:34:08,How Wall Street Banks Made A Killing On Spac Craze,"New York Investment Banks Have Raked In Billions Of Dollars By Feeding The Frenzy For Blank Check Companies, And They Have Done So Largely Without Risking Any Of Their Own Money On Hundreds Of Deals That Have Left Many Investors With Punishing Losses A Look At One Of These Deals Shows How In Late 2020, Acies Acquisition Corp Tapped Into Investor Demand For Blank Check Companies Formally Known As Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, Or Spacs With An Initial Public Offering That Raised 215 Million Among The Investment Banks Acies Signed Up To Underwrite The Ipo Were Jpmorgan Chase Co, Morgan Stanley And Oppenheimer Co When The Offering Closed, Acies, Essentially A Shell Company, Followed The Spac Template With The Cash It Had Raised, It Had Two Years To Find And Merge With A Private Company Seeking A Stock Market Listing, Or Return The Money To Investors Acies Management Team Announced It Was On The Hunt For A Business In The Experiential Entertainment Industry The Team Didn T Have To Look For Very Long Hours After The Ipo Closed, Bankers Advising Playstudios Inc Contacted Acies Managers To Tell Them The Las Vegas Based Maker Of Mobile Casino Games Was For Sale, Regulatory Filings Show Those Bankers Were Also With Jpmorgan In Early 2021, The Two Companies Announced Plans For A Merger That Valued Playstudios At 1 1 Billion In The Run Up To The Merger And The Listing Of The Combined Company S Shares, Playstudios Touted A Rosy Future It Forecast That Surging Ad Sales, A New Role Playing Game And Cross Marketing Offerings To Game Players Would Bring A 20% Rise In Revenue In 2021 And A 33% Jump This Year Since Then, The Company Has Scrapped The New Game, And Revenue Fell Far Short Of Predictions Retail Investors Suffered The Consequences The Stock Is Down More Than 50% Since Shareholders Approved The Merger Last June Playstudios Is One That Looks Like Crap Right Now, Dan Ushman, A 37 Year Old Chicago Area Entrepreneur, Said Earlier This Year He Put About 26,000 Into Acies After It Announced Its Deal With Playstudios And Soon Saw His Investment Drop More Than 35% Investment Banks Involved In The Deal Fared Much Better, Having Risked None Of Their Own Money, Based On A Reuters Review Of Regulatory Filings Jpmorgan, In Particular, Pocketed Hefty Fees For Its Dual Role As An Underwriter For The Acies Ipo And As An Adviser To Playstudios Perfectly Legal, Despite The Apparent Conflict Of Interest, If The Bank Discloses Its Role, As Jpmorgan Did The Bank Has Not Disclosed Its Fees, But Financial Data Provider Refinitiv Estimates That Jpmorgan Earned 4 7 Million In Underwriting Fees And 14 2 Million As A Sell Side Adviser It Also Received 1 6 Million For Helping Acies Raise Additional Capital Through A Maneuver Known As Private Investment In Public Equity, Or Pipe, According To Financial Research Firm Morningstar Inc And A Reuters Analysis Pipes, Which Tap Big Institutional Investors, Are Often Necessary To Close A Spac Merger Morgan Stanley Earned About 5 9 Million And Oppenheimer About 1 2 Million In Underwriting Fees, According To Refinitiv Estimates Each Bank Also Got About 1 6 Million In Pipe Related Fees, According To Morningstar And A Reuters Analysis Liontree Advisors, Another Playstudios Adviser, Earned 6 2 Million On The Deal, According To Refinitiv Estimates, Plus 1 6 Million In Pipe Fees, According To Morningstar And A Reuters Analysis Jp Morgan, Morgan Stanley And Liontree Declined To Comment An Oppenheimer Spokesman Said The Bank Had A Minor Role In The Acies Ipo Playstudios Noted That The Jpmorgan Teams It And Acies Worked With Came From Separate Divisions Of The Bank The Company Said It Has A Robust Framework For Evaluating, Approving, Executing And Optimizing Its Game Initiatives, And That It Is Continually Revisiting The Conditions And Decision To Either Advance Or Suspend An Initiative A Curious Pattern The Disparate Outcomes Of The Acies Playstudios Deal Big Bucks For The Investment Banks That Sold It And Big Losses For Retail Investors Who Bought Into It Are Typical Of Many Spac Deals For This Article, Reuters Analyzed Hundreds Of Spacs Spanning Roughly Two Years, Reviewed Banks Internal Documents And Regulatory Filings, And Interviewed More Than Two Dozen Bankers, Investors, Spac Managers, Lawyers And Corporate Executives The Examination Found That Investment Banks Turbocharged To Their Benefit What Turned Out To Be A Speculative Bubble In Companies That Have Often Failed To Live Up To Their Pre Listing Hype The Spac Market Has Sagged Since The Collapse Of Some High Profile Blank Check Listings Amid Overall Grim Market Conditions And In March, The U S Securities And Exchange Commission Sec Proposed New Rules That Would Increase Disclosure Requirements And Potential Legal Liability For Spacs And Their Banks Facing These Market And Regulatory Challenges, Some Banks Have Been Pulling Back From The Business Whatever Happens To The Spac Market, The Reuters Examination Reveals In Detail For The First Time How, Over The Past Couple Of Years, Wall Street Banks Have Enriched Themselves By Aggressively Promoting The Deals In The Absence Of The Legal Guardrails And Financial Risks Associated With Traditional Ipos Credit Suisse Summed It Up Last Year In A Confidential Client Presentation Reviewed By Reuters Spacs Bend The Rules Of The Ipo Market The Swiss Bank Has Had A Role In 136 Blank Check Deals Since The Beginning Of 2020 Through The End Of March, According To A Reuters Analysis Of Spac Research Data A Credit Suisse Spokesperson Said The Language In The Presentation Pertains To Spac Market Conventions That Give Companies And Investors More Flexibility Than In Traditional Ipos The Bank Is Committed To Recommending Strategies That Conform To All Applicable Rules, The Spokesperson Said In A Traditional Ipo, Underwriters Can Be Held Responsible Under Securities Law For Any Misleading Forecasts, Projections Or Other Statements Made To Investors To Protect Themselves Against Liability, Banks Perform Rigorous Due Diligence On Companies Whose Ipos They Underwrite, And Those Companies Generally Do Not Issue Public Forecasts About Their Performance Banks Also Buy Big Chunks Of An Issuing Company S New Shares, Risking Losses If They Can T Resell The Stock For More Than They Paid With A Spac, A Bank S Role As Underwriter Ends Once The Blank Check Company Completes Its Ipo, But The Bank Receives A Portion Of Its Fee Only After The Spac Makes An Acquisition By The Time The Spac Announces A Merger, Spac Underwriters Aren T Responsible For Forecasts And Other Claims About The Performance Of The Company To Be Acquired And Publicly Listed And Because Blank Check Ipos Are Typically Priced At A Nominal 10, Banks Do Not Run The Risk Of Having To Sell New Shares That Fall In Value For Investment Banks, Blank Check Deals Create Moral Hazard An Incentive To Take On Risk Because Of Little Exposure To It According To Usha Rodrigues, A Law Professor At The University Of Georgia Who Studies Spacs That S Because They Don T Have The Same Liability With A Spac That They Have With A Traditional Ipo, But Banks Do Get To Collect Fees If They Can Get A Deal Done, She Said The Companies That Merged With Spacs Don T Have The Same Level Of Vetting, Which Most Retail Investors Do Not Realize Shares Of Companies That Obtained A Stock Market Listing In A Spac Merger From 2019 Through The Beginning Of March Were Down Roughly 36% On Average From When Their Deals Closed, According To Data Provided By Jay Ritter, A Professor Of Finance At The University Of Florida That S Even Worse Than The 14% Decline In Shares Of Companies That Went Public Through Traditional Ipos During The Same Period, According To Nasdaq Inc All Told, According To Vanda Research, Retail Investors Lost 4 8 Billion, Or 23%, Of The Aggregate 21 3 Billion They Plowed Into Spacs From The Beginning Of 2020 To The First Week Of April 2022 Yet The Deals That Brought Those Shares To Market Have Yielded A Bonanza For Investment Banks Industry Tracker Coalition Greenwich Estimates That Banks Booked About 8 Billion In Spac Related Fees In 2020 And 2021 That Represents Roughly 6 5% Of Total U S Investment Banking Fees That Major Banks Collected In That Period, According To Coalition Greenwich The Bank Has An Incentive To Push The Deal To Get Closed, At Any Price, Because They Want Their 3 5% Of The Spac Ipo Proceeds, Said Mike Stegemoller, A Professor Of Banking And Finance At Baylor University, Referring To The Fees Underwriters Receive Only After A Spac Merger Closes I Think The Conflict Is With Retail Investors Who Are Buying Common Shares Of Stock Do You Really Think Banks Care About These Retail Investors I Think There Are Good Incentives Not To Many Banks Amped Up Their Take By Working For Both Sides Of Deals, As Jpmorgan Did With Acies And Playstudios Reuters Identified Roughly 50 Such Cases From Early 2020 To November 2021 Soured Sentiment As The Spac Bubble Has Deflated, Debate Over Responsibility For Investor Losses Has Focused On The Executives Of Blank Check Companies These Founding Investors Referred To As Sponsors Risk Losing All Of Their Investment If They Can T Find A Company To Take Public Through A Merger Within The Two Year Window However, Founders Acquire Their Shares At Deep Discounts To The Typical 10 Offering Price, Thanks To Preferential Treatment And Fees That Can Dilute Retail Investors Holdings Likewise, The Hedge Funds And Other Institutional Investors That Account For A Lot Of The Money Behind Spacs Often Obtain Their Shares In An Ipo Or Subsequent Pipe Under Favorable Terms That Put Them At An Advantage Relative To Retail Investors The Sec Put Spacs On Notice Last Year With Several Enforcement Actions Against Specific Companies And Their Sponsors For Allegedly Misleading Investors About Their Prospects Then, In Late March, The Regulator Announced Its Proposed Rules, Which Would, Among Other Things, Establish That Investment Banks That Underwrite Spacs Could Be Held Legally Liable For False Or Misleading Forecasts Or Statements About Blank Check Deals The Sec Will Vote On The Rules After The Public Comment Period Ends Later This Spring The Sec Declined To Comment In A March 30 Statement On The Proposed Rules, Sec Chair Gary Gensler Said Gatekeepers Such As Underwriters Should Have To Stand Behind And Be Responsible For Basic Aspects Of Their Work And Provide An Essential Function To Police Fraud And Ensure The Accuracy Of Disclosure To Investors In Its Proposed Rules, The Sec Said That The Fees Underwriting Banks Receive When A Spac Closes A Deal Could Indicate Participation In The Merger, And That Banks Also Have A Strong Financial Interest In Making Sure A Spac Inks A Deal For These Reasons, The Regulator Said, It Is Proposing Increasing Banks Liability To Date, Investors Have Not Sought To Hold Major Wall Street Banks Responsible For False Or Misleading Information Alleged In Any Of The 47 Spac Related Class Action Shareholder Lawsuits Filed Since 2021, According To A Reuters Analysis Of A Public Database Maintained By Stanford Law School And Attorney Kevin Lacroix, Who Follows The Cases None Of Those Cases Have Yet Succeeded In Court One Aspect Of Spacs That Has Already Drawn Regulatory Scrutiny Is Undisclosed Dealings Between Blank Check Companies And Their Targets Before A Merger Is Announced That S Because Investors Could Be Misled If A Spac Privately Shakes Hands With An Acquisition Target While Publicly Stating It Is Still Seeking The Best Possible Merger Partner Communications Between A Spac And Its Acquisition Target Are Part Of An Sec Investigation Of Former U S President Donald Trump S 1 25 Billion Deal, Announced Last October, To List His New Social Media Venture On The Stock Market In A December Filing, Digital World Acquisition Corp, The Spac That Is Merging With The Former President S Trump Media Technology Group, Disclosed That The Sec Had Asked For Documents Relating To Communications Between

The Law, Digital World Said Trump Media Has Since Launched The Truth Social Platform To Lackluster Effect Trump Media And Digital World Acquisition Corp Did Not Respond To Requests For Comment The Sec Declined To Comment In The Acies Playstudios Deal, Pre Existing Relationships Raise The Question Of Whether The Two Companies Already Had A Merger In Mind, Potentially Precluding Better Deals For Investors Acies Told Investors When It Launched Its Ipo That It Had Not Identified A Company To Merge With And That It Would Pursue The Best Opportunity It Could Find However, Andrew Pascal, Chief Executive Officer Of Playstudios, Co Founded Acies With Jim Murren, Who Was Chief Executive Officer Of Mgm Resorts Inc When That Casino Operator Invested In Playstudios, As Was Disclosed In A Securities Filing Playstudios Said It Considered All Viable Spac Proposals And Eventually Made The Decision It Believed Was The Best Of The Available Options For The Company Responding To Reuters Inquiries On Behalf Of Murren And Pascal, Playstudios Noted That Mgm Resorts, Not Murren Personally, Invested In The Company, And That Pascal Recused Himself From All Acies Deliberations Concerning Playstudios Once Talks Began And Forfeited His Economic Interest In Acies To Avoid Even The Appearance Of Having Conflicting Interests Backwater To Bonanza For Decades, Spacs Were A Backwater Of Wall Street, Connecting Speculators With Companies That Had No Other Means Of Going Public That Changed In Late 2019 And Early 2020, When Shares Of Richard Branson S Spaceflight Provider Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc And Sports Betting Operator Draftkings Inc Surged More Than 600% After Going Public Through Spac Mergers Investors Stuck At Home During The Covid 19 Pandemic And Flush With Cash From

Associated Only With The Highest Quality Partners Some Of Its Past Partners Include Acies, The Spac That Brought Playstudios To Market Shares Of The 51 Companies That Morgan Stanley Has Helped Take

129,20/Jul/2022 00:00:00,20/Jul/2022 14:34:08,How Covid Propelled Trillion Dollar Valuations," A Billion Here, A Billion There, And Pretty Soon You Re Talking Real Money, The Late Us Senator Everett Dirksen Once Said, Mainly With Reference To Out Of Control Federal Spending In America It Was A Snarky Understatement To Emphasise Not Just Wasteful Government Spending, But Also The Value Of A Billion Dollars, Which, Expressed Numerically, Is 1 Followed By Nine Zeroes As In, Us 1,000,000,000 Although The World S First Billion Dollar Company Us Steel Announced Itself In 1901, And The World S First Billionaire John Rockefeller Of Standard Oil Was Minted In 1916, Even In The 1950S, When Dirksen Was Said To Have Made The Comment, A Billion Was Big, Big Bucks Today, A Billion Dollars Or Even A Million Dollars For That Matter Is Still A Lot Of Money For An Individual There Are Approximately 2,800 Known Billionaires And Many Unknown In The World, A List Currently Led By Tesla S Elon Musk, With An Estimated Wealth Of 280Bln But In Corporate Terms, It Is Becoming Chump Change Companies Founded On A Whim And Prayer, Or An App And Hope, Acquire Valuation Of A Billion Dollars In Quick Time, Often Based On Speculative Hope And Hype In An Era Of Easy Come Easy Go, Some Endure, Many Do Not Dubbed Unicorns, A Term First Popularised By Venture Capitalist Aileen Lee After The Mythical Animal To Represent The Statistical Rarity Of Such Successful Ventures, They Have Become A Fairly Common Measure Of Entrepreneurial Fizz In 2013, When The Term Was First Used To Describe Startups That Scaled Up Quickly To A Billion Dollars, There Were Less Than 40 Unicorns, Mainly In The Us Today, There Are An Estimated 1,000 Unicorns Across The World, Including 300 In China And 100 In India Some 30 Unicorns, Including Already Famous Names Such As Spacex, Instacart, Stripe, And Bytedance, Each Valued Between 10Bln And 100Bln, Have Been Given The Name Decacorn Scaling Further Up, Decacorns Become Hectocorns When They Are Valued At Over 100Bln Up Until This Stage, Unicorns, Decacorns, And Hectocorns Are Startup Companies That Are Private, Venture Backed Entities, Recognised And Evaluated For Their Potential For Growth, And Not On Their Financial Performance Riding On Get Big Fast Gbf Strategies, Also Known As Blitzscaling, These Startups Try To Expand At A High Rate Through Large Funding Rounds And Price Cutting To Gain An Advantage On Market Share And Overrun Competitors As Quickly As Possible In Pursuit Of This Foothold Or Market Share, Many Of Them Don T Make A Dime In Profit Instead, They Burn Money To Get Ahead Facebook Was The First Decacorn And Hectocorn In History, Crossing A 100Bln Valuation Before It Went Public Once They Go Public With An Ipo, They No Longer Qualify For The Informal Corn Suffix It Was Followed By China S Alibaba Bytedance, Owners Of The App Tiktok, Which Is Backed By Investors Such As Sequoia Capital China And Softbank Group Among Others, Is A Current Decacorn, Valued At Over 140Bln More Than The Current Market Cap Of Storied Companies Such As At T And American Express Since Facebook Became The First Privately Held Decacorn Turned Hectocorn, A 100Bln Plus Privately Held Company, An Additional 84 Decacorns Have Been Created Not All Have Survived, With 33 Of Them Losing Their Status For Various Reasons This Leaves 51 Companies Still Straining At The Leash To Go Public, Whereupon They Enter New Terrain They Include Names Such As India S Byju S, Currently Valued At 21Bln, Making It The World S Most Valuable Education Technology Startup, And China S Yuanfudao, Also An Edtech Startup Valued At 15 5Bln While Unicorns And Decacorns Grow Through Large Funding Rounds From Private Venture Capital Firms And Investors To Get An Early Foothold In The Marketplace, Sitting On Top Of The Pyramid Are Companies That Do Go Public And Scale A Stratospheric Height Of A Trillion Dollars Companies For Which There Is Still No Agreed Upon Term As Yet The Name Pegasus Has Been Suggested For Such Companies Which Reach The New Valuation Pinnacle Of 1Trln Like The Unicorn, The Pegasus Is Also A Mythical Horse, But With Wind Beneath Its Wings Collectively, They Are Simply Known As Big Tech They Are The T Company The Market Cap Of 1Trln A Trillion Is No Trifling Sum For Starters, It Is 1 Followed By 12 Zeroes As In 1,000,000,000,000 A Trillion Dollars Is Greater Than The Gross Domestic Product Gdp Of All But A Score Of Countries It Is Greater Than The Gdp Of Switzerland, Sweden And Argentina, Each With Gdp Below One Trillion Dollars In Nominal Terms For That Matter, The Valuation Of Apple, Which Recently Crossed 3Trln It Has Since Dropped To About 2 65Trln At The Time Of Writing , Nudged The Gdp Of Great Britain And India, Two Of The Larger Economies Of The World Today, There Are Around Half A Dozen Companies In The World That Have A Market Cap Of Over 1Trln All But Saudi Aramco Are Us Born And Us Based, And Each Has A Tech Orientation As Of March 31, 2022, They Are Led By Apple 2 85Trln , Followed By Microsoft 2 31Trln , Alphabet Google 1 84Trln , Amazon 1 65Trln , And, The Most Recent Addition To The List, Tesla 1 1Trln Couple Others Have Crossed The 1 T Mark Or Nibbled At It And Receded Notably Petrochina And Meta Facebook The Rise, Rise, And Rise Of Us Tech Companies Has Also Led To Growing Concerns About Big Tech An Analogous Recall Of Market Dominance By A Few Companies In Other Market Sectors Such As Big Oil And Big Pharma For Instance, The Big Five Tech Stocks, Originally Dubbed Faamg Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, And Google And Now Taamg With Tesla Replacing Facebook, Which Has Lost Nearly 30 Per Cent Of Its Valuation , Account For About A Quarter Of The Market Capitalisation Of The Entire 500 Companies In Standard Poor S 500 This Effectively Means 1% Of The Companies In The Index Account For About 25% Of The Total Market Value Such Market Concentration Isn T Unusual In Fact, Some Companies In The Past Represented An Even Bigger Share Of The Market Back In 1932, At T Accounted For 13% Of Total Us Stock Market Value, More Than Twice Apple S Approximately 6% Share Of The Current S P Value About 40 Trillion Even Further Back, In 1928, General Motors Represented 8% Of The Market, And, In 1970, Ibm 7% But There Is A Big Difference In The Time And Pace Of How The Modern Big Tech Became Bellwethers While Four Of The Five American Companies Hit The 1Trln Market Cap Before The Pandemic, What Is Remarkable Is That The Onset Of Covid 19 Which Lowered The Boom On Many Traditional Legacy Companies Powered Big Tech To Even Greater Heights For Instance, Apple, Which Hit 1Trln Market Cap On August 2, 2018, Doubled That In Just Two Years, Going Up To 2Trln On August 19, 2020, In The Middle Of The Pandemic It Took Even Less Time To Breach 3Trln On January 3, 2022 Before Receding Slightly Similarly, Microsoft Went From Breaching 1 Trillion In June 2019 To Surpassing 2Trln In June 2021, And Google Went From Scaling 1 T In January 2020 To Topping 2 T In November 2021 So, What Gives How And Why Did This Happen, Particularly During A Pandemic The Pandemic And The Online Giants To Begin With, Even In The Pre Pandemic Economy, Four Members Of The Trillion Dollar Club Tesla Came Late To The Party Dominated Their Respective Market Apple In Smartphones, Microsoft In Cloud Computing, Alphabet Google In Internet Advertising, And Amazon In Online Retail When The Pandemic Kicked In, The Stay Work And Buy From Home Economy Brought Rich Rewards To These Companies While The Already Besieged Brick And Mortar Companies Collapsed, The Online Giants Boomed, Helped In Addition By Stimulus Payments That Put Money In People S Pockets On Top Of Low Interest Rates Apple And Microsoft Sales Of It Products And Cloud Services Soared, As Did Amazon Retailing And Google Services, As People Spent More And More Time Indoors And Online In Many Ways, The Pandemic Helped Clarify A Trend That Was Already Becoming Apparent Before Covid 19 Struck Rewind Or Flashback 25 Years, And You Will See That The Top 10 Companies In Terms Of Market Cap Were A Mix Of Oil, Food, Pharma, And Technology, All Valued Between 100 Million And 220 Million In 1997, The List Of Most Valued Companies In The World Read General Electric, Royal Dutch, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Coca Cola, Intel, Nippon, Merck Toyota, And Novartis Up Until Even A Decade Ago, Five Of The Top Ten Publicly Listed Companies In Terms Of Market Cap Were Oil Companies, With Exxon Mobil And Petrochina Leading The Way There Were Only Two Tech Companies In The List Apple At 3 And Microsoft At 10 In Fact, Petrochina, A Chinese Oil And Gas Company, An Arm Of State Owned China National Petroleum Corporation, Became The First Company To Roar Past The 1 Trillion Mark In 2007, A Decade Before Apple Rang Up Its First Trillion In Market Cap In January 2007, Just As Petrochina Was Nearing The 1 Trillion Valuation, Apple Introduced Its First Iphone, When The Company Was Still Shy Of Being 100 Billion It Was Worth 73 4 Billion At That Point Introducing The Iphone, Apple Founder Steve Jobs Promised A Leapfrog Product That Would Be Way Smarter Than Any Mobile Device Has Ever Been, Super Easy To Use As It Turned Out, Not Only Did Apple Reinvent The Phone, It Reinvented The Market In The Years To Come, The Iphone Would Become One Of History S Best Selling Products, Racking Up Most Recently Sales Of More 200 Billion Annually Within A Decade The Device Has Now Become So Ubiquitous That Television Presenter Jason Silva, Paraphrasing The Philosopher Descartes, Joked Iphone, Therefore I Am Signs That The Iphone Would Power Apple To The Top Spot Became Clear As Early As 2012, When It Displaced Exxonmobil As The World S Most Valuable Company, With Petrochina Slipping To Third Place The New Age Pinnacle In The Decade Since, Apple Has Never Lost That Pole Position Except In 2019,

Yonhap A Dispute Between Kakao Corp Management And Its Labor Union Is Growing Over The It Giant S Rumored Attempt To Sell Its Transportation Service Subsidiary Kakao Mobility To Private Equity Firm Mbk Partners Kakao S Labor Union On Wednesday Accused The Management Of Giving Up On Its Mobility Business, Questioning If The Sell Off To The Private Equity Fund Can Help The Business Grow According To The Union S Statement, Kakao Corp Said Its Mobility Platform Cannot Grow Anymore Under Its Wing, And That The It Giant Has No Intention Of Continuing With The Mobility Business It Added That Kakao S Management Said The Sale Was Necessary For The Business To Expand The Union Sees The Sale Of Kakao Mobility As An Attempt To Prevent Kakao Founder Kim Beom Su From Being Asked To Appear At The National Assembly S State Audit This Year It Said It Would Resume Collecting Signatures From Kakao Corp Employees For A Petition, Which Was Launched In June When Rumors Of A Sale First Began Swirling, To Oppose The Deal Shortly After The Union S Statement Was Released, Bae Jae Hyun, The Company S Chief Investment Officer, Downplayed The Sale Rumors He Said In An Internal Notice That The Company Has Never Considered An Entire Sell Off What We Are Considering Is Changing Kakao S Stake In Kakao Mobility To Become The Second Largest Shareholder By Selling A 10 19 Percent Stake , He Said This Suggests Mbk Would Also Buy Shares From Other Owners To Become The Largest Shareholder Kakao Corp Owns A 57 5 Percent Stake In Kakao Mobility While A Consortium Led By Us Private Equity Firm Tpg Holds A 29 Percent Stake And The Carlyle Group Has A 6 2 Percent Stake The Cio Added That The Company Is Contemplating How Kakao Mobility Can Grow Bigger Beyond Kakao Corp S Boundaries, Saying No Decisions Had Been Made The Union Last Month Met With The It Giant S Leadership Including Kim Sung Su, Chairman Of The Board Of Directors, To Oppose The Sale Kakao Mobility Went Into Turmoil After June 14 When It Was Reported That Mbk Partners One Of The Largest Private Equity Firms In Asia Was In Talks With The It Giant To Buy A 40 Percent Stake In Kakao Mobility, Which Was Valued At 8 5 Trillion Won 6 6 Billion Despite Kakao Corp S Explanation That Nothing Was Decided At The Time, The Sudden News Sparked Outcry From Employees, As The Company Even Had Picked Underwriters In March To Go Public On The Korea Exchange This Year Kakao S Labor Union Then Began Collecting Signatures Of Employees And Staged Protests To Oppose The Sale Of Kakao Mobility The Union Denounced Kakao Corp S Leadership For Reneging On Its Promise To Undergo An Initial Public Offering Previous Ipos Of Kakao Subsidiaries Have Included Stock Options For Employees Prospects Of A Stock Listing Have Faded Due To Weak Market Conditions And Damage To The Corporation S Image After Kakao Pay Executives Dumped Shares In The Company In December Last Year The Executives, Including Ryu Young Joon, Ceo Of Kakao Corp S Mobile Payment Unit, Exercised Their Stock Options To Sell Company Shares Only A Month After Kakao Pay S Listing, Reaping A Windfall Of Almost 90 Billion Won Kakao Pulled Out The Sell Off Card Just Three Months After It Had Vowed To Carry Out Shareholder Friendly Policies Isn T The Company Trying To Retrieve Its Investment In A Different Way As The Option Of Going Public Is Likely Blocked Said The Union A Staffer At One Of Kakao Corp S Subsidiaries Told The Korea Herald That Kakao Mobility Employees Have Been Feeling Uneasy As The Direction Of The Company Is Now Unclear We Don T Know Too Much About What S Going On With The Rumored Sell Off We Just Hope Things Become Clear Soon, Said The Staffer Who Requested Anonymity Kakao Corp Is Under Pressure To Resolve Things One Way Or Another, As An Ipo This Year Was Among The Conditions Of The Minority Shareholders Investments In Kakao Mobility It Is Almost Certain That There Would Be Penalty Clauses For Failing To List, Such As A Requirement To Buy Back Shares At An Elevated Price Or To Engage In A Joint Sale To A Third Party But With The Stock Market In Freefall, Mbk Partners Will Be In No Hurry To Complete The Acquisition, According To An Analyst At A Local Private Equity Firm The Value Of Technology Stocks Has Decreased, So I Think It Is Unlikely For Mbk Partners To Buy Kakao Mobility At The Value Of 8 5 Trillion Won Mbk Partners Has No Reason To Go For That Price At The Moment, He Said The Analyst Noted That Mbk Partners Will Also Consider Tag Along Rights Of Tpg And The Carlyle Group During Negotiations With Kakao Corp Tag Along Rights Allow Minority Shareholders To Sell Their Shares If A Majority Shareholder Is Negotiating A Stake Sale If Mbk Partners Were To Acquire A 40 Percent Stake From Kakao Corp As Well As All Shares Owned By Tpg And The Carlyle Group, It Would Approximately Cost 6 4 Trillion Won Such A Large Deal Could Put Some Burden On Mbk Partners, So Won T They Try To Push The Price Further Down The Analyst Said Since The Second Half Of Last Year, Kakao Mobility Has Been Under Fire For Hiking Ride Hailing Fees And Expanding Into New Business Areas To Provide Designated Driver Services, Quick Delivery And Parcel Delivery The Mobility Application Operator Faced Heat From The Public As Its Expanded Services Drove Small Merchants And Business Owners Out Of Work An It Industry Source Told The Korea Herald That The Sale Of Kakao Mobility Could Give Kakao Corp Some Breathing Room Kakao S Public Image Has Worsened Over The Past Year And Kakao Mobility Was One Of The Major Reasons Behind That So I Think Kakao Might Want To Detach Itself From The Mobility Business If A Deal Is Made, It Would Give Kakao Instant Cash, The Source Said After Kakao Mobility Began As A Spinoff Subsidiary From Kakao Corp In 2017, It Quickly Became The Country S Largest Mobility Platform Service Provider Kakao Mobility Has 30 Million Cumulative Users And 10 Million Monthly Active Users, As Of July The Company Recorded
