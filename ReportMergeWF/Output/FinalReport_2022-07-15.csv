15/Jul/2022 00:00:00,15/Jul/2022 12:26:32,How Wall Street Banks Made A Killing On Spac Craze,"New York Investment Banks Have Raked In Billions Of Dollars By Feeding The Frenzy For Blank Check Companies, And They Have Done So Largely Without Risking Any Of Their Own Money On Hundreds Of Deals That Have Left Many Investors With Punishing Losses A Look At One Of These Deals Shows How In Late 2020, Acies Acquisition Corp Tapped Into Investor Demand For Blank Check Companies Formally Known As Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, Or Spacs With An Initial Public Offering That Raised 215 Million Among The Investment Banks Acies Signed Up To Underwrite The Ipo Were Jpmorgan Chase Co, Morgan Stanley And Oppenheimer Co When The Offering Closed, Acies, Essentially A Shell Company, Followed The Spac Template With The Cash It Had Raised, It Had Two Years To Find And Merge With A Private Company Seeking A Stock Market Listing, Or Return The Money To Investors Acies Management Team Announced It Was On The Hunt For A Business In The Experiential Entertainment Industry The Team Didn T Have To Look For Very Long Hours After The Ipo Closed, Bankers Advising Playstudios Inc Contacted Acies Managers To Tell Them The Las Vegas Based Maker Of Mobile Casino Games Was For Sale, Regulatory Filings Show Those Bankers Were Also With Jpmorgan In Early 2021, The Two Companies Announced Plans For A Merger That Valued Playstudios At 1 1 Billion In The Run Up To The Merger And The Listing Of The Combined Company S Shares, Playstudios Touted A Rosy Future It Forecast That Surging Ad Sales, A New Role Playing Game And Cross Marketing Offerings To Game Players Would Bring A 20% Rise In Revenue In 2021 And A 33% Jump This Year Since Then, The Company Has Scrapped The New Game, And Revenue Fell Far Short Of Predictions Retail Investors Suffered The Consequences The Stock Is Down More Than 50% Since Shareholders Approved The Merger Last June Playstudios Is One That Looks Like Crap Right Now, Dan Ushman, A 37 Year Old Chicago Area Entrepreneur, Said Earlier This Year He Put About 26,000 Into Acies After It Announced Its Deal With Playstudios And Soon Saw His Investment Drop More Than 35% Investment Banks Involved In The Deal Fared Much Better, Having Risked None Of Their Own Money, Based On A Reuters Review Of Regulatory Filings Jpmorgan, In Particular, Pocketed Hefty Fees For Its Dual Role As An Underwriter For The Acies Ipo And As An Adviser To Playstudios Perfectly Legal, Despite The Apparent Conflict Of Interest, If The Bank Discloses Its Role, As Jpmorgan Did The Bank Has Not Disclosed Its Fees, But Financial Data Provider Refinitiv Estimates That Jpmorgan Earned 4 7 Million In Underwriting Fees And 14 2 Million As A Sell Side Adviser It Also Received 1 6 Million For Helping Acies Raise Additional Capital Through A Maneuver Known As Private Investment In Public Equity, Or Pipe, According To Financial Research Firm Morningstar Inc And A Reuters Analysis Pipes, Which Tap Big Institutional Investors, Are Often Necessary To Close A Spac Merger Morgan Stanley Earned About 5 9 Million And Oppenheimer About 1 2 Million In Underwriting Fees, According To Refinitiv Estimates Each Bank Also Got About 1 6 Million In Pipe Related Fees, According To Morningstar And A Reuters Analysis Liontree Advisors, Another Playstudios Adviser, Earned 6 2 Million On The Deal, According To Refinitiv Estimates, Plus 1 6 Million In Pipe Fees, According To Morningstar And A Reuters Analysis Jp Morgan, Morgan Stanley And Liontree Declined To Comment An Oppenheimer Spokesman Said The Bank Had A Minor Role In The Acies Ipo Playstudios Noted That The Jpmorgan Teams It And Acies Worked With Came From Separate Divisions Of The Bank The Company Said It Has A Robust Framework For Evaluating, Approving, Executing And Optimizing Its Game Initiatives, And That It Is Continually Revisiting The Conditions And Decision To Either Advance Or Suspend An Initiative A Curious Pattern The Disparate Outcomes Of The Acies Playstudios Deal Big Bucks For The Investment Banks That Sold It And Big Losses For Retail Investors Who Bought Into It Are Typical Of Many Spac Deals For This Article, Reuters Analyzed Hundreds Of Spacs Spanning Roughly Two Years, Reviewed Banks Internal Documents And Regulatory Filings, And Interviewed More Than Two Dozen Bankers, Investors, Spac Managers, Lawyers And Corporate Executives The Examination Found That Investment Banks Turbocharged To Their Benefit What Turned Out To Be A Speculative Bubble In Companies That Have Often Failed To Live Up To Their Pre Listing Hype The Spac Market Has Sagged Since The Collapse Of Some High Profile Blank Check Listings Amid Overall Grim Market Conditions And In March, The U S Securities And Exchange Commission Sec Proposed New Rules That Would Increase Disclosure Requirements And Potential Legal Liability For Spacs And Their Banks Facing These Market And Regulatory Challenges, Some Banks Have Been Pulling Back From The Business Whatever Happens To The Spac Market, The Reuters Examination Reveals In Detail For The First Time How, Over The Past Couple Of Years, Wall Street Banks Have Enriched Themselves By Aggressively Promoting The Deals In The Absence Of The Legal Guardrails And Financial Risks Associated With Traditional Ipos Credit Suisse Summed It Up Last Year In A Confidential Client Presentation Reviewed By Reuters Spacs Bend The Rules Of The Ipo Market The Swiss Bank Has Had A Role In 136 Blank Check Deals Since The Beginning Of 2020 Through The End Of March, According To A Reuters Analysis Of Spac Research Data A Credit Suisse Spokesperson Said The Language In The Presentation Pertains To Spac Market Conventions That Give Companies And Investors More Flexibility Than In Traditional Ipos The Bank Is Committed To Recommending Strategies That Conform To All Applicable Rules, The Spokesperson Said In A Traditional Ipo, Underwriters Can Be Held Responsible Under Securities Law For Any Misleading Forecasts, Projections Or Other Statements Made To Investors To Protect Themselves Against Liability, Banks Perform Rigorous Due Diligence On Companies Whose Ipos They Underwrite, And Those Companies Generally Do Not Issue Public Forecasts About Their Performance Banks Also Buy Big Chunks Of An Issuing Company S New Shares, Risking Losses If They Can T Resell The Stock For More Than They Paid With A Spac, A Bank S Role As Underwriter Ends Once The Blank Check Company Completes Its Ipo, But The Bank Receives A Portion Of Its Fee Only After The Spac Makes An Acquisition By The Time The Spac Announces A Merger, Spac Underwriters Aren T Responsible For Forecasts And Other Claims About The Performance Of The Company To Be Acquired And Publicly Listed And Because Blank Check Ipos Are Typically Priced At A Nominal 10, Banks Do Not Run The Risk Of Having To Sell New Shares That Fall In Value For Investment Banks, Blank Check Deals Create Moral Hazard An Incentive To Take On Risk Because Of Little Exposure To It According To Usha Rodrigues, A Law Professor At The University Of Georgia Who Studies Spacs That S Because They Don T Have The Same Liability With A Spac That They Have With A Traditional Ipo, But Banks Do Get To Collect Fees If They Can Get A Deal Done, She Said The Companies That Merged With Spacs Don T Have The Same Level Of Vetting, Which Most Retail Investors Do Not Realize Shares Of Companies That Obtained A Stock Market Listing In A Spac Merger From 2019 Through The Beginning Of March Were Down Roughly 36% On Average From When Their Deals Closed, According To Data Provided By Jay Ritter, A Professor Of Finance At The University Of Florida That S Even Worse Than The 14% Decline In Shares Of Companies That Went Public Through Traditional Ipos During The Same Period, According To Nasdaq Inc All Told, According To Vanda Research, Retail Investors Lost 4 8 Billion, Or 23%, Of The Aggregate 21 3 Billion They Plowed Into Spacs From The Beginning Of 2020 To The First Week Of April 2022 Yet The Deals That Brought Those Shares To Market Have Yielded A Bonanza For Investment Banks Industry Tracker Coalition Greenwich Estimates That Banks Booked About 8 Billion In Spac Related Fees In 2020 And 2021 That Represents Roughly 6 5% Of Total U S Investment Banking Fees That Major Banks Collected In That Period, According To Coalition Greenwich The Bank Has An Incentive To Push The Deal To Get Closed, At Any Price, Because They Want Their 3 5% Of The Spac Ipo Proceeds, Said Mike Stegemoller, A Professor Of Banking And Finance At Baylor University, Referring To The Fees Underwriters Receive Only After A Spac Merger Closes I Think The Conflict Is With Retail Investors Who Are Buying Common Shares Of Stock Do You Really Think Banks Care About These Retail Investors I Think There Are Good Incentives Not To Many Banks Amped Up Their Take By Working For Both Sides Of Deals, As Jpmorgan Did With Acies And Playstudios Reuters Identified Roughly 50 Such Cases From Early 2020 To November 2021 Soured Sentiment As The Spac Bubble Has Deflated, Debate Over Responsibility For Investor Losses Has Focused On The Executives Of Blank Check Companies These Founding Investors Referred To As Sponsors Risk Losing All Of Their Investment If They Can T Find A Company To Take Public Through A Merger Within The Two Year Window However, Founders Acquire Their Shares At Deep Discounts To The Typical 10 Offering Price, Thanks To Preferential Treatment And Fees That Can Dilute Retail Investors Holdings Likewise, The Hedge Funds And Other Institutional Investors That Account For A Lot Of The Money Behind Spacs Often Obtain Their Shares In An Ipo Or Subsequent Pipe Under Favorable Terms That Put Them At An Advantage Relative To Retail Investors The Sec Put Spacs On Notice Last Year With Several Enforcement Actions Against Specific Companies And Their Sponsors For Allegedly Misleading Investors About Their Prospects Then, In Late March, The Regulator Announced Its Proposed Rules, Which Would, Among Other Things, Establish That Investment Banks That Underwrite Spacs Could Be Held Legally Liable For False Or Misleading Forecasts Or Statements About Blank Check Deals The Sec Will Vote On The Rules After The Public Comment Period Ends Later This Spring The Sec Declined To Comment In A March 30 Statement On The Proposed Rules, Sec Chair Gary Gensler Said Gatekeepers Such As Underwriters Should Have To Stand Behind And Be Responsible For Basic Aspects Of Their Work And Provide An Essential Function To Police Fraud And Ensure The Accuracy Of Disclosure To Investors In Its Proposed Rules, The Sec Said That The Fees Underwriting Banks Receive When A Spac Closes A Deal Could Indicate Participation In The Merger, And That Banks Also Have A Strong Financial Interest In Making Sure A Spac Inks A Deal For These Reasons, The Regulator Said, It Is Proposing Increasing Banks Liability To Date, Investors Have Not Sought To Hold Major Wall Street Banks Responsible For False Or Misleading Information Alleged In Any Of The 47 Spac Related Class Action Shareholder Lawsuits Filed Since 2021, According To A Reuters Analysis Of A Public Database Maintained By Stanford Law School And Attorney Kevin Lacroix, Who Follows The Cases None Of Those Cases Have Yet Succeeded In Court One Aspect Of Spacs That Has Already Drawn Regulatory Scrutiny Is Undisclosed Dealings Between Blank Check Companies And Their Targets Before A Merger Is Announced That S Because Investors Could Be Misled If A Spac Privately Shakes Hands With An Acquisition Target While Publicly Stating It Is Still Seeking The Best Possible Merger Partner Communications Between A Spac And Its Acquisition Target Are Part Of An Sec Investigation Of Former U S President Donald Trump S 1 25 Billion Deal, Announced Last October, To List His New Social Media Venture On The Stock Market In A December Filing, Digital World Acquisition Corp, The Spac That Is Merging With The Former President S Trump Media Technology Group, Disclosed That The Sec Had Asked For Documents Relating To Communications Between

The Law, Digital World Said Trump Media Has Since Launched The Truth Social Platform To Lackluster Effect Trump Media And Digital World Acquisition Corp Did Not Respond To Requests For Comment The Sec Declined To Comment In The Acies Playstudios Deal, Pre Existing Relationships Raise The Question Of Whether The Two Companies Already Had A Merger In Mind, Potentially Precluding Better Deals For Investors Acies Told Investors When It Launched Its Ipo That It Had Not Identified A Company To Merge With And That It Would Pursue The Best Opportunity It Could Find However, Andrew Pascal, Chief Executive Officer Of Playstudios, Co Founded Acies With Jim Murren, Who Was Chief Executive Officer Of Mgm Resorts Inc When That Casino Operator Invested In Playstudios, As Was Disclosed In A Securities Filing Playstudios Said It Considered All Viable Spac Proposals And Eventually Made The Decision It Believed Was The Best Of The Available Options For The Company Responding To Reuters Inquiries On Behalf Of Murren And Pascal, Playstudios Noted That Mgm Resorts, Not Murren Personally, Invested In The Company, And That Pascal Recused Himself From All Acies Deliberations Concerning Playstudios Once Talks Began And Forfeited His Economic Interest In Acies To Avoid Even The Appearance Of Having Conflicting Interests Backwater To Bonanza For Decades, Spacs Were A Backwater Of Wall Street, Connecting Speculators With Companies That Had No Other Means Of Going Public That Changed In Late 2019 And Early 2020, When Shares Of Richard Branson S Spaceflight Provider Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc And Sports Betting Operator Draftkings Inc Surged More Than 600% After Going Public Through Spac Mergers Investors Stuck At Home During The Covid 19 Pandemic And Flush With Cash From Government Stimulus Payments Helped Drive Those Gains, And They Clamored For More Wall Street Banks Were Happy To Oblige And Began Aggressively Promoting The Business In Client Presentations And Other Documents Reviewed By Reuters, They Repeatedly Acknowledged The Tainted Reputation Of Spacs And Boasted Of Their Ability To Bring Quality Companies To Market Through Blank Check Deals In A 2020 Presentation, Morgan Stanley Said There Was A Historical Perception Of Lower Quality Companies Picking The Spac Route, Although Views Have Improved Somewhat For Its Part, Morgan Stanley Said It Associated Only With The Highest Quality Partners Some Of Its Past Partners Include Acies, The Spac That Brought Playstudios To Market Shares Of The 51 Companies That Morgan Stanley Has Helped Take Public Through Spacs Either As An Adviser Or By Raising Money To Close The Deal Since The Beginning Of 2020 Were Down 28% On Average Through Late March, According To A Reuters Analysis Morgan Stanley

15/Jul/2022 00:00:00,15/Jul/2022 12:26:32,How Covid Propelled Trillion Dollar Valuations," A Billion Here, A Billion There, And Pretty Soon You Re Talking Real Money, The Late Us Senator Everett Dirksen Once Said, Mainly With Reference To Out Of Control Federal Spending In America It Was A Snarky Understatement To Emphasise Not Just Wasteful Government Spending, But Also The Value Of A Billion Dollars, Which, Expressed Numerically, Is 1 Followed By Nine Zeroes As In, Us 1,000,000,000 Although The World S First Billion Dollar Company Us Steel Announced Itself In 1901, And The World S First Billionaire John Rockefeller Of Standard Oil Was Minted In 1916, Even In The 1950S, When Dirksen Was Said To Have Made The Comment, A Billion Was Big, Big Bucks Today, A Billion Dollars Or Even A Million Dollars For That Matter Is Still A Lot Of Money For An Individual There Are Approximately 2,800 Known Billionaires And Many Unknown In The World, A List Currently Led By Tesla S Elon Musk, With An Estimated Wealth Of 280Bln But In Corporate Terms, It Is Becoming Chump Change Companies Founded On A Whim And Prayer, Or An App And Hope, Acquire Valuation Of A Billion Dollars In Quick Time, Often Based On Speculative Hope And Hype In An Era Of Easy Come Easy Go, Some Endure, Many Do Not Dubbed Unicorns, A Term First Popularised By Venture Capitalist Aileen Lee After The Mythical Animal To Represent The Statistical Rarity Of Such Successful Ventures, They Have Become A Fairly Common Measure Of Entrepreneurial Fizz In 2013, When The Term Was First Used To Describe Startups That Scaled Up Quickly To A Billion Dollars, There Were Less Than 40 Unicorns, Mainly In The Us Today, There Are An Estimated 1,000 Unicorns Across The World, Including 300 In China And 100 In India Some 30 Unicorns, Including Already Famous Names Such As Spacex, Instacart, Stripe, And Bytedance, Each Valued Between 10Bln And 100Bln, Have Been Given The Name Decacorn Scaling Further Up, Decacorns Become Hectocorns When They Are Valued At Over 100Bln Up Until This Stage, Unicorns, Decacorns, And Hectocorns Are Startup Companies That Are Private, Venture Backed Entities, Recognised And Evaluated For Their Potential For Growth, And Not On Their Financial Performance Riding On Get Big Fast Gbf Strategies, Also Known As Blitzscaling, These Startups Try To Expand At A High Rate Through Large Funding Rounds And Price Cutting To Gain An Advantage On Market Share And Overrun Competitors As Quickly As Possible In Pursuit Of This Foothold Or Market Share, Many Of Them Don T Make A Dime In Profit Instead, They Burn Money To Get Ahead Facebook Was The First Decacorn And Hectocorn In History, Crossing A 100Bln Valuation Before It Went Public Once They Go Public With An Ipo, They No Longer Qualify For The Informal Corn Suffix It Was Followed By China S Alibaba Bytedance, Owners Of The App Tiktok, Which Is Backed By Investors Such As Sequoia Capital China And Softbank Group Among Others, Is A Current Decacorn, Valued At Over 140Bln More Than The Current Market Cap Of Storied Companies Such As At T And American Express Since Facebook Became The First Privately Held Decacorn Turned Hectocorn, A 100Bln Plus Privately Held Company, An Additional 84 Decacorns Have Been Created Not All Have Survived, With 33 Of Them Losing Their Status For Various Reasons This Leaves 51 Companies Still Straining At The Leash To Go Public, Whereupon They Enter New Terrain They Include Names Such As India S Byju S, Currently Valued At 21Bln, Making It The World S Most Valuable Education Technology Startup, And China S Yuanfudao, Also An Edtech Startup Valued At 15 5Bln While Unicorns And Decacorns Grow Through Large Funding Rounds From Private Venture Capital Firms And Investors To Get An Early Foothold In The Marketplace, Sitting On Top Of The Pyramid Are Companies That Do Go Public And Scale A Stratospheric Height Of A Trillion Dollars Companies For Which There Is Still No Agreed Upon Term As Yet The Name Pegasus Has Been Suggested For Such Companies Which Reach The New Valuation Pinnacle Of 1Trln Like The Unicorn, The Pegasus Is Also A Mythical Horse, But With Wind Beneath Its Wings Collectively, They Are Simply Known As Big Tech They Are The T Company The Market Cap Of 1Trln A Trillion Is No Trifling Sum For Starters, It Is 1 Followed By 12 Zeroes As In 1,000,000,000,000 A Trillion Dollars Is Greater Than The Gross Domestic Product Gdp Of All But A Score Of Countries It Is Greater Than The Gdp Of Switzerland, Sweden And Argentina, Each With Gdp Below One Trillion Dollars In Nominal Terms For That Matter, The Valuation Of Apple, Which Recently Crossed 3Trln It Has Since Dropped To About 2 65Trln At The Time Of Writing , Nudged The Gdp Of Great Britain And India, Two Of The Larger Economies Of The World Today, There Are Around Half A Dozen Companies In The World That Have A Market Cap Of Over 1Trln All But Saudi Aramco Are Us Born And Us Based, And Each Has A Tech Orientation As Of March 31, 2022, They Are Led By Apple 2 85Trln , Followed By Microsoft 2 31Trln , Alphabet Google 1 84Trln , Amazon 1 65Trln , And, The Most Recent Addition To The List, Tesla 1 1Trln Couple Others Have Crossed The 1 T Mark Or Nibbled At It And Receded Notably Petrochina And Meta Facebook The Rise, Rise, And Rise Of Us Tech Companies Has Also Led To Growing Concerns About Big Tech An Analogous Recall Of Market Dominance By A Few Companies In Other Market Sectors Such As Big Oil And Big Pharma For Instance, The Big Five Tech Stocks, Originally Dubbed Faamg Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, And Google And Now Taamg With Tesla Replacing Facebook, Which Has Lost Nearly 30 Per Cent Of Its Valuation , Account For About A Quarter Of The Market Capitalisation Of The Entire 500 Companies In Standard Poor S 500 This Effectively Means 1% Of The Companies In The Index Account For About 25% Of The Total Market Value Such Market Concentration Isn T Unusual In Fact, Some Companies In The Past Represented An Even Bigger Share Of The Market Back In 1932, At T Accounted For 13% Of Total Us Stock Market Value, More Than Twice Apple S Approximately 6% Share Of The Current S P Value About 40 Trillion Even Further Back, In 1928, General Motors Represented 8% Of The Market, And, In 1970, Ibm 7% But There Is A Big Difference In The Time And Pace Of How The Modern Big Tech Became Bellwethers While Four Of The Five American Companies Hit The 1Trln Market Cap Before The Pandemic, What Is Remarkable Is That The Onset Of Covid 19 Which Lowered The Boom On Many Traditional Legacy Companies Powered Big Tech To Even Greater Heights For Instance, Apple, Which Hit 1Trln Market Cap On August 2, 2018, Doubled That In Just Two Years, Going Up To 2Trln On August 19, 2020, In The Middle Of The Pandemic It Took Even Less Time To Breach 3Trln On January 3, 2022 Before Receding Slightly Similarly, Microsoft Went From Breaching 1 Trillion In June 2019 To Surpassing 2Trln In June 2021, And Google Went From Scaling 1 T In January 2020 To Topping 2 T In November 2021 So, What Gives How And Why Did This Happen, Particularly During A Pandemic The Pandemic And The Online Giants To Begin With, Even In The Pre Pandemic Economy, Four Members Of The Trillion Dollar Club Tesla Came Late To The Party Dominated Their Respective Market Apple In Smartphones, Microsoft In Cloud Computing, Alphabet Google In Internet Advertising, And Amazon In Online Retail When The Pandemic Kicked In, The Stay Work And Buy From Home Economy Brought Rich Rewards To These Companies While The Already Besieged Brick And Mortar Companies Collapsed, The Online Giants Boomed, Helped In Addition By Stimulus Payments That Put Money In People S Pockets On Top Of Low Interest Rates Apple And Microsoft Sales Of It Products And Cloud Services Soared, As Did Amazon Retailing And Google Services, As People Spent More And More Time Indoors And Online In Many Ways, The Pandemic Helped Clarify A Trend That Was Already Becoming Apparent Before Covid 19 Struck Rewind Or Flashback 25 Years, And You Will See That The Top 10 Companies In Terms Of Market Cap Were A Mix Of Oil, Food, Pharma, And Technology, All Valued Between 100 Million And 220 Million In 1997, The List Of Most Valued Companies In The World Read General Electric, Royal Dutch, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Coca Cola, Intel, Nippon, Merck Toyota, And Novartis Up Until Even A Decade Ago, Five Of The Top Ten Publicly Listed Companies In Terms Of Market Cap Were Oil Companies, With Exxon Mobil And Petrochina Leading The Way There Were Only Two Tech Companies In The List Apple At 3 And Microsoft At 10 In Fact, Petrochina, A Chinese Oil And Gas Company, An Arm Of State Owned China National Petroleum Corporation, Became The First Company To Roar Past The 1 Trillion Mark In 2007, A Decade Before Apple Rang Up Its First Trillion In Market Cap In January 2007, Just As Petrochina Was Nearing The 1 Trillion Valuation, Apple Introduced Its First Iphone, When The Company Was Still Shy Of Being 100 Billion It Was Worth 73 4 Billion At That Point Introducing The Iphone, Apple Founder Steve Jobs Promised A Leapfrog Product That Would Be Way Smarter Than Any Mobile Device Has Ever Been, Super Easy To Use As It Turned Out, Not Only Did Apple Reinvent The Phone, It Reinvented The Market In The Years To Come, The Iphone Would Become One Of History S Best Selling Products, Racking Up Most Recently Sales Of More 200 Billion Annually Within A Decade The Device Has Now Become So Ubiquitous That Television Presenter Jason Silva, Paraphrasing The Philosopher Descartes, Joked Iphone, Therefore I Am Signs That The Iphone Would Power Apple To The Top Spot Became Clear As Early As 2012, When It Displaced Exxonmobil As The World S Most Valuable Company, With Petrochina Slipping To Third Place The New Age Pinnacle In The Decade Since, Apple Has Never Lost That Pole Position Except In 2019, When Microsoft Briefly Toppled It Founded In 1974, Just A Few Months Before Apple By Jobs Contemporary Bill Gates, Microsoft Is Another Money Spinning Behemoth, Often Ranked With Apple As One Of The Most Profitable Companies In The World Just As Apple Reinvented The Phone, And Itself, With The Iphone, Microsoft Relaunched Itself With Cloud Computing, The Biggest Revenue Source For A Company That Was A Byword For Software Relative To Apple And Microsoft, Which Are Of Mid 1970S Vintage, Amazon And Facebook Were Founded In The 1990S Tesla Is Even Newer, Founded Only In 2003 But Each Has Carved A Niche In The Market In Its Area, With Rivals At A Distant Second By Early This Year, Big Tech Had Completely Trumped Traditional Companies, With Eight Of The Ten Most Valued Companies In The World All Belonging To The Tech Stable Apple, Microsoft, Google Alphabet, Amazon, And Tesla Occupying Top Five Positions, With Nvidia, Meta Facebook, And Tsmc In The 5 10 Slot The Only Exceptions Were Berkshire Hathaway At 6 And United Health At 10 So, Are The T Companies Really Worth All That Much, How Much Further Can They And Will They Grow What Propelled Them To Such Dizzy Heights And Will They Survive These Are Questions That Haunt Every Market Maven As The World Teeters On The Brink Of The Twin Crisis Of War And Pestilence The Recent Tumult Over The Hostile Bid For Twitter, And The Meltdown Of Netflix Stock, Has Raised New Questions On Valuation But One Thing Looks Certain, At Least In Our Lifetime The Trillion Dollar Pinnacle Is The New Summit Large Companies Will Aspire To Climb Copyright

Mbk Partners Kakao S Labor Union On Wednesday Accused The Management Of Giving Up On Its Mobility Business, Questioning If The Sell Off To The Private Equity Fund Can Help The Business Grow According To The Union S Statement, Kakao Corp Said Its Mobility Platform Cannot Grow Anymore Under Its Wing, And That The It Giant Has No Intention Of Continuing With The Mobility Business It Added That Kakao S Management Said The Sale Was Necessary For The Business To Expand The Union Sees The Sale Of Kakao Mobility As An Attempt To Prevent Kakao Founder Kim Beom Su From Being Asked To Appear At The National Assembly S State Audit This Year It Said It Would Resume Collecting Signatures From Kakao Corp Employees For A Petition, Which Was Launched In June When Rumors Of A Sale First Began Swirling, To Oppose The Deal Shortly After The Union S Statement Was Released, Bae Jae Hyun, The Company S Chief Investment Officer, Downplayed The Sale Rumors He Said In An Internal Notice That The Company Has Never Considered An Entire Sell Off What We Are Considering Is Changing Kakao S Stake In Kakao Mobility To Become The Second Largest Shareholder By Selling A 10 19 Percent Stake , He Said This Suggests Mbk Would Also Buy Shares From Other Owners To Become The Largest Shareholder Kakao Corp Owns A 57 5 Percent Stake In Kakao Mobility While A Consortium Led By Us Private Equity Firm Tpg Holds A 29 Percent Stake And The Carlyle Group Has A 6 2 Percent Stake The Cio Added That The Company Is Contemplating How Kakao Mobility Can Grow Bigger Beyond Kakao Corp S Boundaries, Saying No Decisions

About What S Going On With The Rumored Sell Off We Just Hope Things Become Clear Soon, Said The Staffer Who Requested Anonymity Kakao Corp Is Under Pressure To Resolve Things One Way Or Another, As An Ipo This Year Was Among The Conditions Of The Minority Shareholders Investments In Kakao Mobility It Is Almost Certain That There Would Be Penalty Clauses For Failing To List, Such As A Requirement To Buy Back Shares At An Elevated Price Or To Engage In A Joint Sale To A Third Party But With The Stock Market In Freefall, Mbk Partners Will Be In No Hurry To Complete The Acquisition, According To An Analyst At A Local Private Equity Firm The Value Of Technology Stocks Has Decreased, So I Think It Is Unlikely For Mbk Partners To Buy Kakao Mobility At The Value Of 8 5 Trillion Won Mbk Partners Has No Reason To Go For That Price At The Moment, He Said The Analyst Noted That Mbk Partners Will Also Consider Tag Along Rights Of Tpg And The Carlyle Group During Negotiations With Kakao Corp Tag Along Rights Allow Minority Shareholders To Sell Their Shares If A Majority Shareholder Is Negotiating A Stake Sale If Mbk Partners Were To Acquire A 40 Percent Stake From Kakao Corp As Well As All Shares Owned By Tpg And The Carlyle Group, It Would Approximately Cost 6 4 Trillion Won Such A Large Deal Could Put Some Burden On Mbk Partners, So Won T They Try To Push The Price Further Down The Analyst

Chulthings Are Changing Rapidly In The World Of Crypto Very Recently, The Global Cryptocurrency Market Saw An Extension Of Volatility Even To Stablecoins, Mostly Due To The Huge Collapse Of The Terrausd, A Ust Or Algorithmic Stablecoin, And Its Sister Token, Luna Which Should Theoretically Maintain A 1 1 Peg To A Currency And Commodity Plus, Because Inflation Remains Too Much Of A Force On Central Banks Around The World, Pressuring Them To Move Expeditiously To Bring The Level Back Down By Raising The Benchmark Rate Sharply, More Than 40 Percent Of Crypto Holders Are Now Underwater In Terms Of Their Investments, According To Analysts All Of The Numbers Are Just Bad The Price Of Bitcoin, The Benchmark Cryptocurrency In The Industry, Has Fallen Below 21,000, Data Shown By Market Tracker Investing Com Said This Fall Is A Major Break From The 31,000 To 32,000 Price Range Bitcoin Had Gotten Into Since The Collapse Of Terra S Ust Back In Early May This Year, Bitcoin S Prices Have Been Slashed By Over 50 Percent Of Its All Time High Of Around 69,000 Back In November 2021 The Crypto Market S Total Market Capitalization Has Crashed To Under 1 Trillion, According To Data From Coinmarketcap Com Cryptocurrency Analysts Have No Big Fears That The Growing Inflation Or Elevated Uncertainty Regarding The Economic Climate Could Persist In The Market As Core Dragging Factors Additionally, The Belief That Crypto Assets Offer A Hedge Against Inflation Is Weakening As Recent Years Price Increases Have Been Thanks To Excess Market Liquidity, Which Also Led To The Rise Of The Major Tech Stocks Listed On The Nasdaq The Point Is That Both Technology Stocks And Cryptocurrencies Are Exposed To The U S Federal Reserve S And Other Central Banks Monetary Tightening Concerns Investors Are Required To Have More Patience If They Want To Give Their Investments The Best Chance For Profit Taking Lee Sirgoo, One Of The Influential Figures In The Global Crypto Industry, As He Is The Chief Executive At Dunamu, The Operator Of The Country S Largest Cryptocurrency Operator, Upbit, Didn T Deny That The Crypto Market Is Heading Towards Being More Bearish Than Bullish Institutional Investors, Who Have Kept Their Crypto Assets In Cold Wallets, A Type Of Digital Wallet That Stores Cryptocurrency Offline, Have Started Unloading Their Holdings Due To The Worsening Macro Economic Conditions Normally, Big Institutional Investors Do Not Store Their Cryptocurrency Assets In Exchanges, The Amount Of Which Is Huge But Out Of Circulation, As They Use Cold Wallets Amid Higher Crypto Demand, This Practice Led To The Increase In Cryptocurrency Prices But They Want To Prepare For The Risks Associated To The Additional Fall In Cryptocurrencies By Reducing Their Crypto Holdings, Resulting In More Supply And Price Fall, Lee Said In A Recent Interview At Its Headquarters In Seoul The Ceo Viewed That The Cryptocurrency Industry Is Facing Credibility Problems Because Risk Contagion In The Market Is Closely Connected To Such External Shocks, Which Could Lead To A Butterfly Effect But Lee Omitted Saying That The Continued Market Tumble Could Also Lead The Industry Itself To Face A Structural Downturn When It Comes To Blockchain Technology, Making Reward Systems Visible Really Matters For Example, If Stocks Could Be Issued As A Type Of Coin, Imminent Transactions Could Happen 365 Days A Year And 24 Hours A Day I Just Want To Highlight That The Technology Behind Cryptocurrencies Is The Most Efficient Way Yes, It S Still Very Necessary For Blockchain Network Participants To Consider A Host Of Issues Including The Legal Structure And Governance Model Of A Blockchain We Have Three To Five Years Or Even More Until Standards Mature And Settle However, Everyone Is Talking About The Price Trend, Which I Do Not Think Is Desirable, Given The Potential Of Blockchain Technology In Many Industrial Areas, Lee Said While Views Are Mixed Over The Validity Of Cryptocurrencies As Some Are Saying That Cryptocurrencies And Even Stablecoins Are Structurally Flawed, As They Won T Replace Normal Money, The Ceo Said He Disagrees With This View Today S Expanded Role Of Smart Contracts, Tools That Can Automatically Execute Transactions Once Specific Conditions Are Met Without Requiring The Help Of An Intermediary They Are Usually Associated With Ethereum, A Type Of Blockchain Well, I Would Say There Are Some Fundamental Issues Regarding The Blockchain Transition To The Proof Of The Stake Consensus Algorithm But The Usage Of Smart Contracts Linked To Ethereum Is Being Widened And I Can See Conditions Are Becoming Favorable As An Improvement Of Reward Systems Is Allowing Market Players To Get Involved With The Release Of Blockchain Based Services Such As Non Fungible Tokens Nfts , Some Of Them Are Currently Used In Culture And Arts Industries, According To The Chief Executive Nfts Are The Latest Cryptocurrency Phenomenon To Go Mainstream Terra Luna Crash Can T Compare To Dotcom Bubble Could Any Good Things Emerge From Terrausd S Crash Lee Believes So While He Said That The Collapse Of The Terra Stablecoin Had Caused The Industry To See A

Move Expeditiously To Bring The Level Back Down By Raising The Benchmark Rate Sharply, More Than 40 Percent Of Crypto Holders Are Now Underwater In Terms Of Their Investments, According To Analysts All Of The Numbers Are Just Bad The Price Of Bitcoin, The Benchmark Cryptocurrency In The Industry, Has Fallen Below 21,000, Data Shown By Market Tracker Investing Com Said This Fall Is A Major Break From The 31,000 To 32,000 Price Range Bitcoin Had Gotten Into Since The Collapse Of Terra S Ust Back In Early May This Year, Bitcoin S Prices Have Been Slashed By Over 50 Percent Of Its All Time High Of Around 69,000 Back In November 2021 The Crypto Market S Total Market Capitalization Has Crashed To Under 1 Trillion, According To Data From Coinmarketcap Com Cryptocurrency Analysts Have No Big Fears That The Growing Inflation Or Elevated Uncertainty Regarding The Economic Climate Could Persist In The Market As Core Dragging Factors Additionally, The Belief That Crypto Assets Offer A Hedge Against Inflation Is Weakening As Recent Years Price Increases Have Been Thanks To Excess Market Liquidity, Which Also Led To The Rise Of The Major Tech Stocks Listed On The Nasdaq The Point Is That Both Technology Stocks And Cryptocurrencies Are Exposed To The U S Federal Reserve S And Other Central Banks Monetary Tightening Concerns Investors Are Required To Have More Patience If They Want To Give Their Investments The Best Chance For Profit Taking Lee Sirgoo, One Of The Influential Figures In The Global Crypto Industry, As He Is The Chief Executive At Dunamu, The Operator Of The Country S Largest Cryptocurrency Operator, Upbit, Didn T Deny That The Crypto Market Is Heading Towards Being More Bearish Than Bullish Institutional Investors, Who Have Kept Their Crypto Assets In Cold Wallets, A Type Of Digital Wallet That Stores Cryptocurrency Offline, Have Started Unloading Their Holdings Due To The Worsening Macro Economic Conditions Normally, Big Institutional Investors Do Not Store Their Cryptocurrency Assets In Exchanges, The Amount Of Which Is Huge But Out Of Circulation, As They Use Cold Wallets Amid Higher Crypto Demand, This Practice Led To The Increase In Cryptocurrency Prices But They Want To Prepare For The Risks Associated To The Additional Fall In Cryptocurrencies By Reducing Their Crypto Holdings, Resulting In More Supply And Price Fall, Lee Said In A Recent Interview At Its Headquarters In Seoul The Ceo Viewed That The Cryptocurrency Industry Is Facing Credibility Problems Because Risk Contagion In The Market Is Closely Connected To Such External Shocks, Which Could Lead To A Butterfly Effect But Lee Omitted Saying That The Continued Market Tumble Could Also Lead The Industry Itself To Face A Structural Downturn When It Comes To Blockchain Technology, Making Reward Systems Visible Really Matters For Example, If Stocks Could Be Issued As A Type Of Coin, Imminent Transactions Could Happen 365 Days A Year And 24 Hours A Day I Just Want To Highlight That The Technology Behind Cryptocurrencies Is The Most Efficient Way Yes, It S Still Very Necessary For Blockchain Network Participants To Consider A Host Of Issues Including The Legal Structure And Governance Model Of A Blockchain We Have Three To Five Years Or Even More Until Standards Mature And Settle However, Everyone Is Talking About The Price Trend, Which I Do Not Think Is Desirable, Given The Potential Of Blockchain Technology In Many Industrial Areas, Lee Said While Views Are Mixed Over The Validity Of Cryptocurrencies As Some Are Saying That Cryptocurrencies And Even Stablecoins Are Structurally Flawed, As They Won T Replace Normal Money, The Ceo Said He Disagrees With This View Today S Expanded Role Of Smart Contracts, Tools That Can Automatically Execute Transactions Once Specific Conditions Are Met Without Requiring The Help Of An Intermediary They Are Usually Associated With Ethereum, A Type Of Blockchain Well, I Would Say There Are Some Fundamental Issues Regarding The Blockchain Transition To The Proof Of The Stake Consensus Algorithm But The Usage Of Smart Contracts Linked To Ethereum Is Being Widened And I Can See Conditions Are Becoming Favorable As An Improvement Of Reward Systems Is Allowing Market Players To Get Involved With The Release Of Blockchain Based Services Such As Non Fungible Tokens Nfts , Some Of Them Are Currently Used In Culture And Arts Industries, According To The Chief Executive Nfts Are The Latest Cryptocurrency Phenomenon To Go Mainstream Terra Luna Crash Can T Compare To Dotcom Bubble Could Any Good Things Emerge From Terrausd S Crash Lee Believes So While He Said That The Collapse Of The Terra Stablecoin Had Caused The Industry To See A Rapid Deterioration Of Investor Sentiment, Wiping Out More Than 200 Billion, The Downfall Is Part Of The Cryptocurrency World S Growing Pains Regarding Questions As To Whether He Views Terra Luna Event As A Ponzi Scheme, He Didn T Clearly Communicate A Definitive Yes Or No Answer However, He Stressed That The Terra Luna Crash Would Have A Limited Impact On The Market This Assessment Is Based On My Belief That The Crypto Industry Will Continue To Evolve As Is It Has Been Doing All Along The Top Noticeable Point For The Terra Luna Project Is That It Doesn T Require Deposits As It Uses A Peg Approach, Which Won Backing From Investors, As This Development Was Viewed As An Alternative Way To Stay In Cash Without Relying On The Fiat Financial System Its Algorithm Design Was Very Creative But The Terra Luna Crash Awakened The Need For The Industry To Have Systems In Terms Of Factoring In Unpredictability To Keep The Crypto Ecosystem Working Experts Said That The Terra Luna Collapse Might Prove The Catalyst For Possible Tougher Regulation Of The Industry And May Accelerate The New Korean Government S Efforts To Regulate Stablecoins Lee Wants To Keep Lots Of Communication Channels Open With Authorities Handling The Crypto Related Issues I Do Not Think The Terra Luna Crash Will Play Out Like The Dotcom Bubble Back In Late 1990S And Early 2000S In The Dotcom Era, Attention Had Too Much Focused On Negative Factors Yes, There Were Lots Of Schemes, Plots And Lies In The Early Age Of The Internet Business But These Were Steps In Creating Companies That Could Never Be Done Before Think About Naver, Kakao And Nc Blockchain Technology Will Also Produce New Business Models In Terms Of Regulatory Framework, I Was Hoping For Regulations To Focus More On Positive Aspects Of The Industry, He Said Regarding Questions As To Whether He Views Terra Luna Event As A Ponzi Scheme, He Didn T Clearly Communicate A Definitive Yes Or No Answer However, He Stressed That The Terra Luna Crash Would Have A Limited

Difficult For Foreign Tokens To List On Korean Exchanges, A Move Which Is Raising Some Concerns From The Crypto Industry, As Doing So Can Discourage Projects From Even Being Tried I Hope Authorities Do Not Remain Hawkish Regarding The Cryptocurrency Industry Just Because Of Concerns Brought About By The Terra Luna Crash He Suggested The Idea Of Having A Grace Period, Which Lets The Industry Self Regulate And Self Monitor To Protect Investors From A Terra Like Repeat Based On Analysis Of An Experimental Session, We Can Begin Talks On How To Better Set Up Regulatory Frameworks But Do We

Have To Have The Methodology And Principles Regarding The Issuance Of Coins According To Lee, The Desirable Path Toward Ico Regulations Would Require A Thorough Examination Of Applicable Financial Reporting And Investment Requirements But It S Debatable Whether Or Not To View Cryptocurrency As Securities Or Commodities We Have A Lot Of Digital Coins And That Means We Need To Have Different Rules According To Different Functions Of Digital Coins Available Views Are That Crypto Is More Like Securities As People Invest Them For Return On Investment However, Some Were Saying Bitcoin Is A Commodity As It S A Form Of Value In The Same Way That Gold Is A Form Of Value, In The Same Way That Oil Is A Form Of Value Ico Is The Crypto Version Of An Ipo In The Stock Market Unlike The Stock

Are Considering Mandating Ico Hopefuls To Submit Investor Prospectuses, Security Declarations, Detailed Information On Transaction Risks, Associated Taxes And Fees With The Money Raised From The Ico
