Mbk Partners Kakao S Labor Union On Wednesday Accused The Management Of Giving Up On Its Mobility Business, Questioning If The Sell Off To The Private Equity Fund Can Help The Business Grow According To The Union S Statement, Kakao Corp Said Its Mobility Platform Cannot Grow Anymore Under Its Wing, And That The It Giant Has No Intention Of Continuing With The Mobility Business It Added That Kakao S Management Said The Sale Was Necessary For The Business To Expand The Union Sees The Sale Of Kakao Mobility As An Attempt To Prevent Kakao Founder Kim Beom Su From Being Asked To Appear At The National Assembly S State Audit This Year It Said It Would Resume Collecting Signatures From Kakao Corp Employees For A Petition, Which Was Launched In June When Rumors Of A Sale First Began Swirling, To Oppose The Deal Shortly After The Union S Statement Was Released, Bae Jae Hyun, The Company S Chief Investment Officer, Downplayed The Sale Rumors He Said In An Internal Notice That The Company Has Never Considered An Entire Sell Off What We Are Considering Is Changing Kakao S Stake In Kakao Mobility To Become The Second Largest Shareholder By Selling A 10 19 Percent Stake , He Said This Suggests Mbk Would Also Buy Shares From Other Owners To Become The Largest Shareholder Kakao Corp Owns A 57 5 Percent Stake In Kakao Mobility While A Consortium Led By Us Private Equity Firm Tpg Holds A 29 Percent Stake And The Carlyle Group Has A 6 2 Percent Stake The Cio Added That The Company Is Contemplating How Kakao Mobility Can Grow Bigger Beyond Kakao Corp S Boundaries, Saying No Decisions

Reneging On Its Promise To Undergo An Initial Public Offering Previous Ipos Of Kakao Subsidiaries Have Included Stock Options For Employees Prospects Of A Stock Listing Have Faded Due To Weak Market

About What S Going On With The Rumored Sell Off We Just Hope Things Become Clear Soon, Said The Staffer Who Requested Anonymity Kakao Corp Is Under Pressure To Resolve Things One Way Or Another, As An Ipo This Year Was Among The Conditions Of The Minority Shareholders Investments In Kakao Mobility It Is Almost Certain That There Would Be Penalty Clauses For Failing To List, Such As A Requirement To Buy Back Shares At An Elevated Price Or To Engage In A Joint Sale To A Third Party But With The Stock Market In Freefall, Mbk Partners Will Be In No Hurry To Complete The Acquisition, According To An Analyst At A Local Private Equity Firm The Value Of Technology Stocks Has Decreased, So I Think It Is Unlikely For Mbk Partners To Buy Kakao Mobility At The Value Of 8 5 Trillion Won Mbk Partners Has No Reason To Go For That Price At The Moment, He Said The Analyst Noted That Mbk Partners Will Also Consider Tag Along Rights Of Tpg And The Carlyle Group During Negotiations With Kakao Corp Tag Along Rights Allow Minority Shareholders To Sell Their Shares If A Majority Shareholder Is Negotiating A Stake Sale If Mbk Partners Were To Acquire A 40 Percent Stake From Kakao Corp As Well As All Shares Owned By Tpg And The Carlyle Group, It Would Approximately Cost 6 4 Trillion Won Such A Large Deal Could Put Some Burden On Mbk Partners, So Won T They Try To Push The Price Further Down The Analyst Said Since The Second Half Of Last Year, Kakao Mobility Has Been Under Fire For Hiking Ride Hailing Fees And Expanding Into New Business Areas To Provide Designated Driver Services, Quick Delivery And Parcel Delivery The Mobility Application Operator Faced Heat From The Public As Its Expanded Services Drove Small Merchants And Business Owners Out Of Work An It Industry Source Told The Korea Herald That The Sale Of Kakao Mobility Could Give Kakao Corp Some Breathing Room Kakao S Public Image Has Worsened Over The Past Year And Kakao Mobility Was One Of The Major Reasons Behind That So I Think

Progress Of Its Corporate Acquisition Efforts, Several Sources Familiar With The Issues Said Chances Are Low That Samsung Will Pursue A Sizable Stake In The British Chip Designer First, The Departures

Samsung Isn T A Processor Company, Samsung Won T Face Severe Antitrust Issues Unlike Complaints And Objections At The Time Of Arm S Attempts To Acquire Nvidia Nonetheless, Because Arm S Core Strengths Are Based On Mobile, Buying Large Chunks Is Not In Samsung S Best Interests Given Its Shift Toward Non Mobile Businesses Samsung Wants To Broaden Its Key Business Portfolios For Corporate Clients And That Means Avoidance Of Any Conflict Of Interest With Its Clients Is Necessary For Samsung From A Profit Standpoint If Arm Is Acquired By Samsung, Then Arm S Clients Will Have Greater Concerns Over Technology Leaks, Lee Seung Woo, An Analyst At Eugene Investment, Said Arm Generates Its Profit From Licensing And Royalty Fees Paid By Its Clients Including Samsung, Apple And Qualcomm, Which Use Its Patented Chip Designs To Produce Their Own Hardware No Powerful Synergy Effects Are Expected From Samsung S Acquisition Of Arm As Samsung Aims To Become The Top Foundry Chip Service Provider By 2030,
