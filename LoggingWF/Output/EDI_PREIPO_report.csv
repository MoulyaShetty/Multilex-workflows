David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, has tasked Salisbury with one of his most prized initiatives: building its asset management business into a juggernaut.

1. Goldman Sachs will reduce the ""velocity"" of its hiring, and won't fill some roles that are vacated through natural attrition. The bank has also reduced compensation expenses for the first half of this year by $3.5 billion versus the same period in 2021, Chief Financial Officer Denis Coleman told analysts during Goldman's second-quarter earnings call on Monday.
    




        Goldman also warned it will reintroduce its annual performance reviews, something it put on hold during the earlier stages of the pandemic. Banks have used such reviews to purge their workforces of under-performing bankers. Historically, Goldman's performance checks have led to the bottom 5% of the staff being laid off.
    




        Weak earnings, particularly in firms' investment-banking divisions, have folks braced for job cuts as Wall Street firms come to terms with a volatile market and high inflation. That's contributed to a slump in dealmaking. M&A volumes are down 21% year-over-year, and fees from equity capital markets are down 72%.
    




And it's not just dealmakers that are fearing cuts. College grads are concerned that their full-time offers might dwindle, too.
    




        BlackRock also told staffers that it's scaling back hiring plans on the back of economic uncertainty, Insider previously reported.
    




        Wall Street firms' adoption of hiring freezes comes just months after many showered bankers with handsome bonuses. Dealmaking soared in the first two years of the pandemic as cheap money and high company valuations prompted firms to tap the capital markets for debt, or to go public via IPO, or through a tie up with a special purpose acquisition vehicle, or SPAC.
    




        Today, however, the sharp dip in revenues in investment banking has prompted a sea change across Wall Street.
    




        Here's everything we know about banks' belt tightening efforts and how it will impact jobs and pay.

If so, please visit Missfresh Limited Shareholder Class Action Lawsuit or contact Peter Allocco at (212) 951-2030 or pallocco@bernlieb.com to discuss your rights.  NEW YORK, July  19, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bernstein Liebhard LLP, a nationally acclaimed investor rights law firm, reminds investors of the deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in a securities class action lawsuit that has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the securities of Missfresh Limited (“Missfresh” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: MF) pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement and related prospectus (collectively, the “Registration Statement”) issued in connection with Missfresh’s June 2021 initial public offering (the “IPO” or “Offering”). The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933.  Missfresh purports to be an innovator and leader in China’s neighborhood retail industry which invented the Distributed Mini Warehouse (DMW) model to operate an integrated online-and-offline on-demand retail business focusing on offering fresh produce and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs).     On or about June 8, 2021, Missfresh filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form F-1, which in combination with a subsequent amendment on Form F-1/A and filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4), would be used for the IPO.  On June 23, 2021, Missfresh filed with the SEC its final prospectus for the IPO on Form 424B4 (the “Prospectus”), which forms part of the Registration Statement. In the IPO, Missfresh sold approximately 21 million American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) at $13.00 per ADS.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ statements in the Registration Statement were materially false and misleading when made because: (1) Missfresh provided false financial figures in its Registration Statement; (2) Missfresh would need to amend its financial figures; (3) Missfresh, among other things, had lesser net revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2021; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times and negligently prepared.  On April 29, 2022, after trading hours, Missfresh filed with the SEC a Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 which announced, among other things, that the independent Audit Committee of the Company’s board of directors, with the assistance of professional advisors, “[wa]s in the process of conducting an internal review of certain matters, including those relating to transactions between the Company and certain third-party enterprises.”   On this news, Missfresh ADSs fell 13% to close at $0.448 per ADS on May 2, 2021.  Then, on May 24, 2022, Missfresh disclosed that the Company was unable to file its 2021 Annual Report by the extended deadline, ""primarily because the Company is unable to complete the audit of the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021"". On this news, Missfresh's ADSs fell $0.018 per share, or 9.7%, over the following two trading days, to close at $0.167 per ADS on May 26, 2022.  Finally, on July 1, 2022, Missfresh issued a press release entitled ""Missfresh Announces the Substantial Completion of the Audit Committee-Led Independent Internal Review"" which disclosed, among other things, that the Company's review ""identified certain transactions . . . that exhibit characteristics of questionable transactions, such as undisclosed relationships between suppliers and customers, different customers or suppliers sharing the same contact information, and/or lack of supporting logistics information"" and that consequently, ""certain revenue associated with those reporting periods in 2021 may have been inaccurately recorded in the Company's financial statements.""  Since the IPO, the price of Missfresh's ADSs has fallen over 97%, closing at $0.3075 per ADS on July 6, 2022.  If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 12, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as lead plaintiff. If you choose to take no action, you may remain an absent class member.

Since 1993, Bernstein Liebhard LLP has recovered over $3.5 billion for its clients. In addition to representing individual investors, the Firm has been retained by some of the largest public and private pension funds in the country to monitor their assets and pursue litigation on their behalf. As a result of its success litigating hundreds of lawsuits and class actions, the Firm has been named to The National Law Journal’s “Plaintiffs’ Hot List” thirteen times and listed in The Legal 500 for ten consecutive years.

NEW YORK, July  19, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bernstein Liebhard LLP, a nationally acclaimed investor rights law firm, reminds investors of the deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in a securities class action lawsuit that has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired: (a) Molecular Partners AG (“Molecular Partners” or the “Company”) American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) pursuant and/or traceable to the Offering Documents issued in connection with the Company’s initial public offering conducted on or about June 16, 2021 (the “IPO”); and/or (b) Molecular Partners securities between June 16, 2021 and April 26, 2022, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and alleges violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Molecular Partners operates as a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapeutic proteins. Leading up to and following the IPO, the Company repeatedly touted the clinical and commercial prospects of certain of its product candidates under development in collaboration with other companies.  Among other product candidates, Molecular Partners is developing ensovibep as a treatment for COVID-19 in collaboration with Novartis AG (“Novartis”). One of the Company’s most important development strategies for ensovibep includes securing Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) for ensovibep from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).  In addition, Molecular Partners is developing MP0310 (AMG 506) for the treatment of certain types of cancer in collaboration with Amgen Inc. (“Amgen”). The Company granted Amgen, among other licenses, the right to progress MP0310’s development program into later stage development, including into combination trials, following Phase 1 data.  On April 22, 2021, Molecular Partners filed a registration statement on Form F-1 with the SEC in connection with the IPO, which, after several amendments, was declared effective by the SEC on June 15, 2021 (the “Registration Statement”). Then, on June 16, 2021, the Company filed a prospectus on Form 424B4 with the SEC in connection with the IPO, which incorporated and formed part of the Registration Statement (collectively, the “Offering Documents”).  Pursuant to the Offering Documents, Molecular Partners conducted the IPO, issuing 3 million of its ADSs to the public at the IPO price $21.25 per ADS, for proceeds to the Company of over $59 million.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ statements in the Offering Documents were materially false and misleading when made because Defendants failed to disclose that: (i) ensovibep was less effective at treating COVID-19 than Defendants had led investors to believe; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was reasonably likely to require an additional Phase 3 study of ensovibep before granting the drug EUA; (iii) waning global rates of COVID-19 significantly reduced the Company’s chances of securing EUA for ensovibep; (iv) as a product candidate, MP0310 was less attractive to Amgen than Defendants had led investors to believe; (v) accordingly, there was a significant likelihood that Amgen would return global rights of MP0310 to Molecular Partners; (vi) as a result of all the foregoing, the clinical and commercial prospects of ensovibep and MP0310 were overstated; and (vii) as a result, the Offering Documents and Defendants’ public statements throughout the Class Period were materially false and/or misleading and failed to state information required to be stated therein.  On November 16, 2021, Molecular Partners disclosed that “a planned futility analysis of ensovibep in [an] ongoing [Phase 3] clinical study . . . has not met the thresholds required to continue enrollment of adults with COVID-19 in the hospitalized setting.” On this news, Molecular Partners’ ADS price fell $4.64 per ADS to close at $10.15 per ADS on November 16, 2021.  Then, on April 26, 2022, months after applying for EUA from the FDA for ensovibep, Novartis’ Chief Executive Officer, Vas Narasimhan, disclosed that “given the latest feedback . . . in our discussions with the [FDA], we would expect the agency to require a Phase 3 study before granting an EUA approval or a general approval” for ensovibep, and that “we need to make a kind of sober evaluation as to is it a doable study in light of the waning rates of COVID around the world[.]”  On this news, Molecular Partners’ ADS price fell $2.68 per ADS to close at $13.89 per ADS on April 26, 2022.  Also on April 26, 2022, during after-market hours, Molecular Partners “announced that Amgen . . . has informed the Company of their decision to return global rights of MP0310 to Molecular Partners following a strategic pipeline review.”  On this news, Molecular Partners’ ADS price fell an additional $5.19 per ADS to close at $8.70 per ADS on April 27, 2022 — a total decline of $7.87 per ADS, or 47.5%, over two consecutive trading days, and 59.06% below the $21.25 per ADS IPO price.  If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 12, 2022.

"Wise created quite the stir when it announced plans to list in London last year.

The payments app, which rebranded from Transferwise ahead of its Initial Public Offering, was founded in 2011 by Estonians Kristo Käärmann and Taavet Hinrikus.

Before its market debut last July, it cemented its place as a darling of the fintech world attracting investment from the likes of Silicon Valley Bank and Sir Richard Branson.

Wise co-founder and chief executive Kristo Käärmann is under investigation for tax fraud

Despite the fanfare the market treaded carefully ahead of its direct listing because of Deliveroo's disastrous debut just three months before, which saw its share price plummet 26 per cent on its first day.

Wise joined the London Stock Exchange with market value of more than £8billion, making it the City's biggest ever tech listing.

Since then it has been a bumpy ride with shares down more than 59 per cent annually and nearly 68 per cent since its IPO.

Revenues hit £186m as Wise tightens grip on market

Wise shares have surged more than 15 per cent today after reporting a sharp rise in revenues.

Revenue jumped to £185.9million in the first quarter after a surge in transactions on its platform. It represents a 51 per cent increase on revenues the year before and 21 per cent rise on the last quarter.

There is no doubt Wise still has a tight grip on the money transfer market. Chief executive Kristo Käärmann said 5million customers had moved more than £24billion across borders in the three months to the end of June, a 49 per cent increase on the previous year.

He added: 'We also reached a key milestone in our mission, more than 50 per cent of all cross-border transfers are now completed instantly.'

The figures represent strong growth for the company coming after its first full-year results in June when profits hit £371.9million. And the company has no plans of stopping any time soon.

Wise has already cut prices for customers and today said it aims to 'sustainably lower prices for customers over time.'

Is Wise a victim of the tech rout?

Analysts seem bullish and investors have reacted well to the payment platform's update to the market today. But why has its share price continued to decline since its listing last year?

Wise is an impressive, fast-growing business as shown in its update today but it came to the market at the height of the rotation to growth stocks last summer.

The tech rout has certainly not helped the company.

Since the start of the year global tech stocks have plummeted on the back of rising inflation and interest rates and Wise is no different, having shed 59 per cent year-to-date.

'The underlying cash profitability is sound – it made £121 million of earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation in the year to 31 March, but on conventional valuation metrics it was very fully valued when it came to market,' said Jason Hollands, managing director of Bestinvest.

'Given the derating and continued growth progress, it might be worth considering [buying]. As always, the principle of caveat emptor – buyer beware – should apply when considering stocks where much of the valuation will be driven by future rather than current earnings expectations.'

Alongside the rotation to value, eToro analyst Mark Crouch thinks 'there will also be nervousness among shareholders about the firm's mission to forever decrease prices.

'Typically speaking, investors like firms that have pricing power otherwise they become too reliant on ever-increasing volumes to drive growth. However, Wise's founder is on record as saying he would like to eradicate all fees.

'Wise is a good business that provides a valuable service, but it needs to get better at explaining to investors why it is worth backing.'

Finally, chief executive Kristo Käärmann remains under investigation for tax fraud after he was fined for failing to pay £720,495 of tax for the 2017-2018 tax year.

Wise has said it would support the co-founder but the investigation has done little to quell uncertainty among shareholders.

The payments platform has bold ambitions and has proved it still dominates the money transfer market. But rising interest rates and the move away from tech stocks will continue to be a significant challenge for Wise.",19/Jul/2022 00:00:00,20/Jul/2022 14:34:08,Why are Wise shares down 70% on its IPO a year later?,"[Transferwise, Initial Public Offering, Taavet Hinrikus, Silicon Valley Bank, Deliveroo, the London Stock Exchange, Bestinvest, eToro, Wise, Wise],[]",https://ipo.einnews.com/article/582000310?lcf=OCDoEYEqDerAgfzLAbKEdQ%3D%3D
"Omada Health, a chronic-care startup, raised $192 million in February.

The cash should last Omada until it reaches profitability, CEO Sean Duffy told Insider.

Omada was under pressure to go public last year amid a wave of digital-health IPOs.

A little more than a year ago, Sean Duffy, the CEO of the chronic-care startup Omada Health, came to expect the same question on repeat from investors, healthcare executives, and reporters.

""Every question would start with, 'So when are you going public?'"" Duffy told Insider this month.

Founded in 2011, Omada was one of the first startups to take on digital health. But as record funding poured into the industry last year, the company appeared to be sitting on the sidelines, having last raised funds in May 2020.

It turns out that Omada's patience paid off.

Having not gone public, it avoided a brutal sell-off of health-tech stocks. Teladoc, which bought Omada's key rival Livongo for $13.9 billion near the peak of the funding frenzy, has seen its stock tank by more than 80% since its 2020 high.

Instead, Omada has put its plans for an initial public offering on hold, Duffy said, opting to raise another private round of cash in February, before the economic downturn began. The crossover round, meant to help Omada gear up for an IPO, netted the startup $192 million, including from investment firms that back companies right before they go public. The cash is enough to fund Omada until it's profitable, Duffy told Insider. The round valued Omada at more than $1 billion.

""An IPO is a great destination. It's likely the right move for Omada. But foundationally, it's a capital-raising event,"" Duffy said. ""The pros of trying to sprint out to the public markets really don't outweigh the cons if things don't go right.""

Now the questions Duffy fields have shifted from why the company isn't public yet to which digital-health startups it'll buy as cash gets tougher to find, he said.

""And I'm like, 'Same answer,'"" Duffy said. ""Mostly stay the course.""

See the deck that Omada used to raise $192 million from Fidelity Management & Research Co., which led the round, aMoon, Perceptive Advisors, Wellington Management, Civilization Ventures, and more.

SINGAPORE, July 19 (Reuters) - QSR Brands, the Malaysian operator of KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in Southeast Asia, has again delayed its domestic IPO of up to $500 million on worries that poor macroeconomic conditions could hurt its valuation, four sources told Reuters.

QSR (M) Holdings Bhd, which holds the sole right from Yum! Brands Inc (YUM.N) to run the fast food chains in Brunei, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore, is now looking to launch its initial public offering (IPO) next year, the sources, who were aware of the matter, said.

The company, backed by private equity firm CVC Capital Partners and Malaysian state investment firm Johor Corp, was seeking to raise $400 million-$500 million by end-2022, the sources said.

""Increasing shareholder value is a key objective and we are always looking for the right opportunity,"" a QSR representative said in an emailed response to Reuters on Tuesday, without referring to the company's IPO plans. Johor Corp and CVC did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

The sources did not want to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

If successful, the fundraising would have been Malaysia's largest IPO since South Korea's Lotte Chemical Titan Holdings Bhd (LOTT.KL) raised $878 million in 2017.

QSR was aiming for a market valuation of at least 6 billion ringgit ($1.35 billion), two of the sources said.

A sharp rise in interest rates coupled with worries of slower economic growth have battered investors' appetite for new stock issuance globally. read more

QSR has made multiple attempts to list since 2017. It last shelved its IPO plan in 2019 due to choppy local markets and Malaysian political uncertainty.

Fundraising from Southeast Asian IPOs has halved to $3.5 billion from January to mid-July 2022 compared with a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data.

The amount raised from Malaysian IPOs has, however, risen 37% to $570 million, with the number of IPOs increasing to 21 from 17.

Selangor-headquartered QSR runs more than 850 KFC and 500 Pizza Hut restaurants in this region, according to its website.

"July 19 (Reuters) - Chinese authorities are preparing to impose a fine of more than $1 billion on ride-hailing firm Didi Global , people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, a move that could bring an end to a probe into the firm's cybersecurity practices.The people said the fine would be more than 8 billion yuan ($1.28 billion), accounting for about 4.7% of Didi's $27.3 billion total revenue last year. They declined to be identified as the information was not yet made public.The Wall Street Journal first reported the potential size of the fine earlier on Tuesday.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterThe ride-hailing firm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Didi's fine would be the largest regulatory penalty imposed on a Chinese tech company since e-commerce titan Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and delivery giant Meituan (3690.HK) were fined $2.75 billion and $527 million respectively last year by China's antitrust regulator.Alibaba's fine equated to about 4% of its 2019 domestic sales, while Meituan's was equivalent to 3% of its 2020 domestic sales.Didi's penalty could pave the way for Beijing to ease a restriction banning it from adding new users to its platform and allow its apps to be restored on domestic app stores.Didi, co-founded in 2012 by former Alibaba employee Will Wei Cheng and backed by SoftBank Group (9984.T) and Uber Technologies (UBER.N), previously set aside 10 billion yuan for a potential fine, Reuters previously reported.1/2The Didi logo is seen on the facade of the company headquarters in Beijing, China November 9, 2021.

"July 19 (Reuters) - Chinese authorities are preparing to impose a fine of more than $1 billion on ride-hailing firm Didi Global , people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, a move that could bring an end to a probe into the firm's cybersecurity practices.The people said the fine would be more than 8 billion yuan ($1.28 billion), accounting for about 4.7% of Didi's $27.3 billion total revenue last year. They declined to be identified as the information was not yet made public.The Wall Street Journal first reported the potential size of the fine earlier on Tuesday.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterThe ride-hailing firm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Didi's fine would be the largest regulatory penalty imposed on a Chinese tech company since e-commerce titan Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and delivery giant Meituan (3690.HK) were fined $2.75 billion and $527 million respectively last year by China's antitrust regulator.Alibaba's fine equated to about 4% of its 2019 domestic sales, while Meituan's was equivalent to 3% of its 2020 domestic sales.Didi's penalty could pave the way for Beijing to ease a restriction banning it from adding new users to its platform and allow its apps to be restored on domestic app stores.Didi, co-founded in 2012 by former Alibaba employee Will Wei Cheng and backed by SoftBank Group (9984.T) and Uber Technologies (UBER.N), previously set aside 10 billion yuan for a potential fine, Reuters previously reported.1/2The Didi logo is seen on the facade of the company headquarters in Beijing, China November 9, 2021.

 Bernstein Liebhard LLP, a nationally acclaimed investor rights law firm, reminds investors of the deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in a securities class action lawsuit that has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the securities of Missfresh Limited (""Missfresh"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: MF) pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement and related prospectus (collectively, the ""Registration Statement"") issued in connection with Missfresh's June 2021 initial public offering (the ""IPO"" or ""Offering""). The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933.
 Missfresh purports to be an innovator and leader in China's neighborhood retail industry which invented the Distributed Mini Warehouse (DMW) model to operate an integrated online-and-offline on-demand retail business focusing on offering fresh produce and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs).
 On or about June 8, 2021, Missfresh filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form F-1, which in combination with a subsequent amendment on Form F-1/A and filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4), would be used for the IPO.
 On June 23, 2021, Missfresh filed with the SEC its final prospectus for the IPO on Form 424B4 (the ""Prospectus""), which forms part of the Registration Statement. In the IPO, Missfresh sold approximately 21 million American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") at $13.00 per ADS.
 Plaintiff alleges that Defendants' statements in the Registration Statement were materially false and misleading when made because: (1) Missfresh provided false financial figures in its Registration Statement; (2) Missfresh would need to amend its financial figures; (3) Missfresh, among other things, had lesser net revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2021; and (4) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times and negligently prepared.
 On April 29, 2022, after trading hours, Missfresh filed with the SEC a Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 which announced, among other things, that the independent Audit Committee of the Company's board of directors, with the assistance of professional advisors, ""[wa]s in the process of conducting an internal review of certain matters, including those relating to transactions between the Company and certain third-party enterprises.""   On this news, Missfresh ADSs fell 13% to close at $0.448 per ADS on May 2, 2021.
 Then, on May 24, 2022, Missfresh disclosed that the Company was unable to file its 2021 Annual Report by the extended deadline, ""primarily because the Company is unable to complete the audit of the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021"". On this news, Missfresh's ADSs fell $0.018 per share, or 9.7%, over the following two trading days, to close at $0.167 per ADS on May 26, 2022.
 Finally, on July 1, 2022, Missfresh issued a press release entitled ""Missfresh Announces the Substantial Completion of the Audit Committee-Led Independent Internal Review"" which disclosed, among other things, that the Company's review ""identified certain transactions . . . that exhibit characteristics of questionable transactions, such as undisclosed relationships between suppliers and customers, different customers or suppliers sharing the same contact information, and/or lack of supporting logistics information"" and that consequently, ""certain revenue associated with those reporting periods in 2021 may have been inaccurately recorded in the Company's financial statements.""
 Since the IPO, the price of Missfresh's ADSs has fallen over 97%, closing at $0.3075 per ADS on July 6, 2022.
 If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 12, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as lead plaintiff. If you choose to take no action, you may remain an absent class member.

 EQNX::TICKER_START (NASDAQ:MOLN), EQNX::TICKER_END Did you lose money on investments in Molecular Partners? If so, please visit Molecular Partners AG Shareholder Class Action Lawsuit or contact Peter Allocco at (212) 951-2030 or pallocco@bernlieb.com to discuss your rights.
 Bernstein Liebhard LLP, a nationally acclaimed investor rights law firm, reminds investors of the deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in a securities class action lawsuit that has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired: (a) Molecular Partners AG (""Molecular Partners"" or the ""Company"") American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") pursuant and/or traceable to the Offering Documents issued in connection with the Company's initial public offering conducted on or about June 16, 2021 (the ""IPO""); and/or (b) Molecular Partners securities between June 16, 2021 and April 26, 2022, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and alleges violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 Molecular Partners operates as a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapeutic proteins. Leading up to and following the IPO, the Company repeatedly touted the clinical and commercial prospects of certain of its product candidates under development in collaboration with other companies.
 Among other product candidates, Molecular Partners is developing ensovibep as a treatment for COVID-19 in collaboration with Novartis AG (""Novartis""). One of the Company's most important development strategies for ensovibep includes securing Emergency Use Authorization (""EUA"") for ensovibep from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"").
 In addition, Molecular Partners is developing MP0310 (AMG 506) for the treatment of certain types of cancer in collaboration with Amgen Inc. (""Amgen""). The Company granted Amgen, among other licenses, the right to progress MP0310's development program into later stage development, including into combination trials, following Phase 1 data.
 On April 22, 2021, Molecular Partners filed a registration statement on Form F-1 with the SEC in connection with the IPO, which, after several amendments, was declared effective by the SEC on June 15, 2021 (the ""Registration Statement""). Then, on June 16, 2021, the Company filed a prospectus on Form 424B4 with the SEC in connection with the IPO, which incorporated and formed part of the Registration Statement (collectively, the ""Offering Documents"").
 Pursuant to the Offering Documents, Molecular Partners conducted the IPO, issuing 3 million of its ADSs to the public at the IPO price $21.25 per ADS, for proceeds to the Company of over $59 million.
 Plaintiff alleges that Defendants' statements in the Offering Documents were materially false and misleading when made because Defendants failed to disclose that: (i) ensovibep was less effective at treating COVID-19 than Defendants had led investors to believe; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was reasonably likely to require an additional Phase 3 study of ensovibep before granting the drug EUA; (iii) waning global rates of COVID-19 significantly reduced the Company's chances of securing EUA for ensovibep; (iv) as a product candidate, MP0310 was less attractive to Amgen than Defendants had led investors to believe; (v) accordingly, there was a significant likelihood that Amgen would return global rights of MP0310 to Molecular Partners; (vi) as a result of all the foregoing, the clinical and commercial prospects of ensovibep and MP0310 were overstated; and (vii) as a result, the Offering Documents and Defendants' public statements throughout the Class Period were materially false and/or misleading and failed to state information required to be stated therein.
 On November 16, 2021, Molecular Partners disclosed that ""a planned futility analysis of ensovibep in [an] ongoing [Phase 3] clinical study . . . has not met the thresholds required to continue enrollment of adults with COVID-19 in the hospitalized setting."" On this news, Molecular Partners' ADS price fell $4.64 per ADS to close at $10.15 per ADS on November 16, 2021.
 Then, on April 26, 2022, months after applying for EUA from the FDA for ensovibep, Novartis' Chief Executive Officer, Vas Narasimhan, disclosed that ""given the latest feedback . . . in our discussions with the [FDA], we would expect the agency to require a Phase 3 study before granting an EUA approval or a general approval"" for ensovibep, and that ""we need to make a kind of sober evaluation as to is it a doable study in light of the waning rates of COVID around the world[.]""
 On this news, Molecular Partners' ADS price fell $2.68 per ADS to close at $13.89 per ADS on April 26, 2022.
 Also on April 26, 2022, during after-market hours, Molecular Partners ""announced that Amgen . . . has informed the Company of their decision to return global rights of MP0310 to Molecular Partners following a strategic pipeline review.""
 On this news, Molecular Partners' ADS price fell an additional $5.19 per ADS to close at $8.70 per ADS on April 27, 2022 -- a total decline of $7.87 per ADS, or 47.5%, over two consecutive trading days, and 59.06% below the $21.25 per ADS IPO price.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as lead plaintiff.

"Reporter: Ridwan Nanda Mulyana | Editor: Herlina Kartika Dewi KONTAN.CO.ID - JAKARTA. The company's enthusiasm for listing on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) is still high. So far, there have been 26 new issuers that have completed an initial public offering (IPO) in 2022. The fates of these newcomers are different. There are those whose share prices soared up to 1,500%, but there are also those who languish until they are stuck at the gocap level. PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia Tbk (ADMR) has been phenomenal with price spikes that have so far held at the level of 1.580%. ADMR shares were able to rise 10.89% on Tuesday (19/7) to a price of Rp 1,680. The surge in the price of PT WIR Asia Tbk (WIRG) was no less astonishing in the early days of the IPO. The share price of the issuer that carries the development of the metaverse platform is still recorded to be up 95.04%. WIRG shot up 6.80% to the price of Rp 550 today. Read also: Holding IPO, Rohartindo Nusantara Luas (TOOL) Offers Shares at a Price of Rp 122 - Rp 135 New income from PT Dewi Shri Farmindo Tbk (DEWI) also immediately stepped on the gas. After just two days on the stock exchange, its share price has risen 69.81% to Rp 182. In contrast to fate, PT Nusatama Berkah Tbk (NTBK) has actually fallen to the level of gocap shares. PT Mitra Angkasa Sejahtera Tbk (BAUT) accompanied the list of issuers with a share price of Rp 50. PT Nanotech Indonesia Global Tbk (NANO) and PT Winner Nusantara Jaya Tbk (WINR) almost followed. The share prices of NANO and WINR are compact in the area of ​​Rp 52. Although they are still far from the gocap level, a number of stocks tend to stagnate and even have a flushing trend, such as PT Adhi Commuter Properti Tbk (ADCP) and PT Semacom Integrated Tbk (SEMA). Sucor Sekuritas analyst Paulus Jimmy highlighted that the company's fundamentals and valuation are crucial factors when trading on the stock market. But there is another important thing that should not be forgotten, namely the story. Story is considered important because it relates to public interest in understanding the issuer's profile, strategy, and business prospects in the future. Therefore, Jimmy believes that not all issuers whose prices fell after the IPO have poor fundamentals and valuations. ""It could be because of the low interest of investors in the stories from these issuers. It should be understood that the story of every industry has a cycle. What is not interesting today, tomorrow could be interesting,"" said Jimmy when contacted by Kontan.co.id, Tuesday (19/7). ). Technical Analyst Binaartha Sekuritas Ivan Rosanova added that sectoral sentiment could also influence the direction of stocks after the IPO. It could be that market players relinquish ownership after the IPO because they are looking at other stocks that are considered more attractive for now.

Considering the recent market fluctuations, in the short term there is a chance for a correction to occur. But as long as the issuer's performance and business prospects are still positive, investors tend to accumulate rather than profit taking, so the price is relatively maintained. Even so, Ivan reminded him to be careful when entering into new stocks whose prices have soared considerably. ""It's better to wait for the release of the performance, especially if the valuation is quite high, especially for stocks that have not experienced a significant correction,"" said Ivan. In the midst of a market trend that is prone to selling pressure, Ivan suggested that the portion of the investment portfolio is also directed to bigcap stocks. For now, it's best not to be aggressive while observing market developments. ""Take advantage of every rebound to get short-term profits while slowly filling the portfolio with selected stocks,"" said Ivan. Jimmy had a similar record. Jimmy suggested that investors should pay attention to market conditions which tend to be volatile this year, so don't be too aggressive towards IPO shares if you don't understand the fundamental conditions. Associate Director of Research and Investment Pilarmas Investindo Sekuritas Maximilianus Nico Demus also highlighted the high market interest in IPO shares. The attraction is, the opportunity to gain money is felt to be bigger. Also Read: Listening to Dewi Shri Farmindo's (DEWI) Business Development Plan After the IPO ""Even though no one knows when the stock will go up or down. But we can find out where it is going. What's important is how confident investors are in the stock,"" said Nico . Nico emphasized that this belief must come from careful consideration of the fundamental condition and valuation of the company, as well as the business sector that is inline with the direction of government policies or the global situation. For this year, Nico sees non-cyclical consumers, healthcare, commodities, and energy as still attractive sectors to look at. Meanwhile, MNC Sekuritas Technical Analyst Herditya Wicaksana favors the mining sector, as it is influenced by high commodity prices. ADMR shares can still be collected by observing the support at Rp. 1,455 and resistance at Rp. 1,800. Then, technically there is a chance for SEMA stock to strengthen even in the short term. You can watch the support area at Rp 176 and resistance at Rp 198. Ivan also supports ADMR shares with a target price at Rp 1,850. Furthermore, WIRG shares, which as long as they are still above the psychological level of Rp 500 have the potential to rebound. WIRG targets are at Rp 615 and Rp 680.

""Currently, CHEM's sales are to textile factories such as Kahatex, Centex, Indorama and others. Chemstar's market share is now only 2%-3%,"" he said to Kontan, Friday (15/7). He revealed that in the future there are still many opportunities to increase market share. Wenty said, the opportunity to increase market share is very large, what is currently needed is working capital. With the IPO, this working capital challenge can be overcome. Also Read: Integra Indocabinet (WOOD) Still Optimizing Exports to the US this Year For information, during the IPO celebration, CHEM released 500 million new shares or 29.41% of the issued and fully paid capital. CHEM conducted an IPO at a price of Rp 150 per share. Thus, CHEM obtained fresh funds of Rp 75 billion which will be used for the purchase of land and buildings as well as working capital. In terms of performance, CHEM is also aiming for an optimistic target of 15% growth in revenue this year. This means that CHEM is projected to record revenues of around Rp 103 billion this year. CHEM has set a growth target of 15% for the next 5 years. In terms of profit, this new issuer targets a growth of around 14.3 percent. This estimate cannot be separated from the condition of high demand from the supply-chain shock, aka the non-fulfillment of demand for the domestic textile industry. This is in line with the energy crisis and high logistics costs. As an illustration, in 2021 CHEM recorded operating revenues of Rp. 89.62 billion, an increase of 13% when compared to sales in 2020 of Rp. 79.33 billion. With this achievement, CHEM managed to record an increase in net profit of 192% on an annual basis, compared to 2020 which only grew 14%. ""Efforts to achieve performance targets, we continue to look for new principals, additional sales and marketing teams,"" he added.

Fortunately, continued Wenty, Chemstar has gone through a cycle of inflation and the US dollar exchange rate has fluctuated several times since its establishment in 2004. ""With this experience, we are able and confident to be able to overcome CHEM's business challenges,"" he concluded. Check other News and Articles on Google News DONATE, Get Free Vouchers!

"The pipeline of initial public offerings to the Australian Securities Exchange has collapsed on concerns about rising interest rates and geopolitical instability, new analysis shows. Just 15 floats were registered with the ASX as at the end of June, seeking to raise a total of $121 million, compared to 43 proposed listings a year earlier that sought a combined $1.25 billion, according to a report on the IPO market by advisory firm HLB Mann Judd. There is little IPO activity scheduled for the second half of 2022. Louie Douvis All but two of the pending floats as at June 30 were from the resources sector. The dire outlook for activity in the second half of 2022 comes after a sluggish first six months during which 59 listings raised $790 million, down from 61 listings raising $2.9 billion in the same period last year. The slowdown is even more pronounced in comparison to the final six months of 2021, when 130 companies listed, raising almost $10 billion.

"LONDON: Chinese authorities are preparing to impose a fine of more than $1 billion on ride-hailing firm Didi Global, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, a move that could bring an end to a probe into the firmâs cybersecurity practices.
The people said the fine would be more than 8 billion yuan ($1.28 billion), accounting for about 4.7 percent of Didiâs $27.3 billion total revenue last year. They declined to be identified as the information was not yet made public.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the potential size of the fine earlier on Tuesday.
The ride-hailing firm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Didiâs fine would be the largest regulatory penalty imposed on a Chinese tech company since e-commerce titan Alibaba Group and delivery giant Meituan were fined $2.75 billion and $527 million respectively last year by Chinaâs antitrust regulator.
Alibabaâs fine equated to about 4 percent of its 2019 domestic sales, while Meituanâs was equivalent to 3 percent of its 2020 domestic sales.
Didiâs penalty could pave the way for Beijing to ease a restriction banning it from adding new users to its platform and allow its apps to be restored on domestic app stores.
Didi, co-founded in 2012 by former Alibaba employee Will Wei Cheng and backed by SoftBank Group and Uber Technologies, previously set aside 10 billion yuan for a potential fine, Reuters previously reported.
The company has struggled to bring its business back to normal after angering Chinese regulators by pushing ahead with its $4.4 billion New York listing in June 2021 despite being asked to put the float on hold.
Days after Didi went public, Chinaâs powerful Internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China, launched a cybersecurity probe into the companyâs data practices and ordered app stores to remove 25 mobile apps operated by Didi.
The restrictions have chipping away at Didiâs dominance and allowed rival ride-hailing services operated by automakers Geely and SAIC Motor to gain market share.
The company announced it would delist from the New York Stock Exchange in December, and won its shareholdersâ nod for the plan in May.
Shares of Didi soared in their initial public offering (IPO), giving the company a valuation of $80 billion. It was the biggest US listing by a Chinese firm since 2014.
Besides Didi, the CAC also launched cybersecurity reviews of Full Truck Alliance and online recruitment firm Kanzhun Ltd. July 2021.
Kanzhun and Full Truck Alliance said on June 29 the regulator had given their apps the go-ahead to resume new user registrations.",19/Jul/2022 00:00:00,20/Jul/2022 14:34:08,"China to fine Didi more than $1 billion for data breaches, sources say","[Didi Global, Didiâs, The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, Alibaba Group, Meituan, SoftBank Group and Uber Technologies, Reuters, the Cyberspace Administration of China, SAIC Motor, the New York Stock Exchange, CAC, Full Truck Alliance, Kanzhun Ltd., Full Truck Alliance],[]",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2125221/media
"Drug and medical services startup PharmEasy is in talks with investors to raise $200 million, but at a valuation that could be 15% or even 25% lower than last year's $5.1 billion, two people with direct knowledge of deal talks told Reuters. Signalling growing stress in India's startup ecosystem, one source said PharmEasy, backed by big-name investors such as Prosus, TPG and Temasek, is in talks to secure the new funds at a valuation as much as 15% below last year's. A second source said the company, which offers online medicine deliveries and diagnostic test services, has told its bankers to consider even a 25% reduction if needed to close the deal. That could cut PharmEasy's valuation for the new funding round to $3.8 billion, and the sources said an initial public offering (IPO) first targeted for 2022 has been delayed. Indian startups have been jolted by uncertain global and domestic stock markets, and growing investor scepticism over what they say are sky-high valuations, making it difficult for PharmEasy to raise funds at same or a higher valuation, the sources said. They declined to be named as the talks on raising funds were private. PharmEasy's planned fund raising is set to see participation from some existing investors, who have indicated they will commit about $115 million in the new round, said the first source involved in the talks. API Holdings, PharmEasy's parent company which is looking to raise the funds, declined to comment. API owns other businesses including diagnostic test provider Thyrocare. The company had seen its valuation jump in recent years in a boom moment for India's startups in general and a growth surge in its own sector, where rivals include Reliance's Netmeds, Tata's 1mg and Walmart's Flipkart. Last year, Indian startups raised a record $35 billion in private funding and many internet companies went public. PharmEasy, too, cashed in on the boom raised a total of $1.89 billion since 2015, with most of it coming in the last two years, data from Pitchbook shows. Among high-profile Indian startups, a 'down round' deal by PharmEasy's - when a firm sells shares at a lower valuation than before - will be the first in recent times. Bank of America Securities and Morgan Stanley are working on the deal, said the sources. Morgan Stanley declined comment, while Bank of America did not respond. IPO ON HOLD, MOUNTING LOSSES Betting on higher healthcare spends and growing use of online ordering, API Holdings last year filed a prospectus to raise 62.5 billion rupees ($782 million) in an IPO, hoping to list in 2022. The sources confirmed that plan is now delayed. One concern among investors before the market debut is mounting losses of the digital pharmacy, the sources said. PharmEasy's parent saw its total income more than double to $714 million in the fiscal year to March 2022. But total expenses for the period amounted to $1.06 billion, partly due to a one-time employee stock benefits outlay, according to a document viewed by Reuters that listed PharmEasy's latest unaudited financials. The net loss for the year quadrupled to $334 million, the document stated. PharmEasy is currently in a ""wait and watch"" mode and considering listing next year, the first source said. A third person with knowledge of the matter also said the IPO may only take place late in 2023, and PharmEasy's parent may be required to refile IPO regulatory papers. The IPO delay comes as stocks of prominent Indian listings of last year, such as digital payments firm Paytm and food-delivery firm Zomato, have fallen more than 60% from their peaks.

"SummaryCompaniesWar and markets slump add to hurdles for carmaker's IPOSteep price discount likely to pull it off - sourcesLandmark listing comes as German carmakers seek to go electricLONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - Porsche may have to go public at a steep discount if it insists on going ahead as economic obstacles mount, two people involved in the landmark multi-billion-euro listing said.The prospect of a larger than customary discount would be a setback to the controlling families pushing the initial public offering to fund a costly makeover from petrol- to electric-driven sports cars.Original expectations have been high for the luxury car brand owned by Europe's biggest carmaker, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). Some had valued Porsche at more than 80 billion euros ($81.89 billion), according to bankers involved.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterBut the people involved said a bigger-than-usual markdown may now be necessary to secure what could be one of the world's largest stock-market debuts - in the face of war, threat of recession and energy shortages.Porsche may have to settle for as little as 60 billion euros, one of the people said, noting that the owners would not accept anything less.The people shared their assessment, amid a wider debate about the price tag for one of Germany's most prestigious brands unfolding weeks ahead of the expected IPO.One of the people said owners of the fastcar maker have different views on how highly it should be valued. A third person involved in the preparations said investors had yet to agree on a valuation formula.This week, Porsche's top management outlined their business plans to investors. Chief Finance Officer Lutz Meschke told journalists the carmaker was ""financially resilient"" and ""well-prepared for further steps"".Porsche estimated revenue of more than 38 billion in 2022, up from 33 billion in 2021, despite a 5% drop in deliveries in the first six months of this year.  read more Behind the scenes, however, some investors are wavering.Last month, Bernstein Research put a wide range of possible valuations on Porsche, from 55 billion euros to 100 billion euros.It set the 'fair value' at about 75 billion euros, based on a formula including Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT), calling Porsche ""a great company but not Ferrari"" because of the latter's higher margins.A top-20 Volkswagen shareholder told Reuters it was not keen on the IPO because only a small amount of stock will be sold, giving new shareholders little influence.The shareholder, asking not to be named, said Porsche would be better off staying within the Volkswagen Group, while the IPO would not ""create value"" in the long term.Earlier this week, Porsche Chief Executive Oliver Blume and Meschke were upbeat in their presentations.Business was robust during the pandemic, Blume said. ""There is big need in the capital markets and a lot of money to invest.""Bankers running the deal intend to survey market conditions at the end of August, with a Porsche board decision and an intention to float (ITF) document potentially set for publication soon after, and a view to trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange at the turn of the third to fourth quarter, the people said.A spokesperson for Porsche said there had been no ""new decisions"" on its IPO plans, while Volkswagen declined to comment.ELECTRIC SWITCHThe listing is happening as Germany's carmakers seek to loosen the bond with the diesel and petrol motors that won global acclaim and shift towards quieter, cleaner battery models.Porsche wants 80% of its car sales to be electric by 2030, roughly quadrupling the current level, while Volkswagen has also embarked on an ambitious shift towards electric vehicles, batteries and software. The listing is designed to fund that overhaul.If the listing does not go ahead or gets through only at a discount, there is less to invest.A listing would also shift the balance of power at Europe's top carmaker, Volkswagen, which controls Porsche since a botched takeover attempt of VW more than a decade ago. At the time, the Porsche and Piech families became Volkswagen's most influential investors.An IPO would win Porsche and its family owners greater control over the sportscar maker, the company has said.However, the economic hurdles are steep.Just $2.3 billion has been raised on German equity capital markets this year, down 90% on a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data. Only 12.5% of Porsche stock will be in 'free float', and European carmakers' valuations have plunged since the start of 2022.Luxury carmakers have been particularly hard hit. Aston Martin's market cap has lost 57% of its value since the beginning of 2022, while almost a third has been shaved off Ferrari's valuation.One banker involved said Porsche might be compared to highly rated luxury brands, such as French luxury goods house LVMH (LVMH.PA), but it still remains in the shadow of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).($1 = 0.9769 euros)Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterAdditional reporting by Christoph Steitz in Frankfurt, Victoria Waldersee in Berlin and Lucy Raitano in London; editing by John O'Donnell and Richard ChangOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",20/Jul/2022 00:00:00,20/Jul/2022 14:34:08,Analysis: Porsche faces uphill drive in race to public listing,"[Reuters, Volkswagen, Porsche, FREE, Porsche, Porsche, Bernstein Research, Porsche, Earnings Before Interest, Porsche, Volkswagen, Reuters, Porsche, the Volkswagen Group, Porsche, Blume, Porsche, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Porsche, Volkswagen, Porsche, Volkswagen, Volkswagen, Porsche, Porsche, Volkswagen, Porsche, Refinitiv, Porsche, Ferrari, Porsche, Tesla Inc (, FREE, The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles],[]",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2OV0BB

So far, there have been 26 new issuers that have completed their initial public offering (IPO) in 2022. The fates of these newcomers are different. There are those whose share prices soared up to 1,500%, but there are also those who languish until they are stuck at the gocap level. PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia Tbk (ADMR) has been phenomenal with price spikes that have so far held at the level of 1.580%. ADMR shares were able to rise 10.89% on Tuesday (19/7) to a price of Rp 1,680. The surge in the price of PT WIR Asia Tbk (WIRG) was no less astonishing in the early days of the IPO. The share price of the issuer that carries the development of the metaverse platform is still recorded to be up 95.04%. WIRG shot up 6.80% to the price of Rp 550 today.

Just two days on the stock exchange, its share price has risen 69.81% to Rp 182. In contrast to fate, PT Nusatama Berkah Tbk (NTBK) is currently falling to the level of gocap shares. PT Mitra Angkasa Sejahtera Tbk (BAUT) accompanied the list of issuers with a share price of Rp 50. PT Nanotech Indonesia Global Tbk (NANO) and PT Winner Nusantara Jaya Tbk (WINR) almost followed. The share prices of NANO and WINR are compact in the area of ​​Rp 52. Although they are still far from the gocap level, a number of stocks tend to stagnate and even have a flushing trend, such as PT Adhi Commuter Properti Tbk (ADCP) and PT Semacom Integrated Tbk (SEMA). Sucor Sekuritas analyst Paulus Jimmy highlighted that the company's fundamentals and valuation are crucial factors when trading on the stock market. But there is another important thing that should not be forgotten, namely the story. Story is considered important because it relates to public interest in understanding the issuer's profile, strategy, and business prospects in the future. Therefore, Jimmy believes that not all issuers whose prices fell after the IPO have poor fundamentals and valuations. ""It could be because of the low interest of investors in the stories from these issuers. It should be understood that the story of every industry has a cycle. What is not interesting today, tomorrow could be interesting,"" said Jimmy when contacted by Kontan.co.id, Tuesday (19/7). ). Technical Analyst Binaartha Sekuritas Ivan Rosanova added that sectoral sentiment could also influence the direction of stocks after the IPO. It could be that market players relinquish ownership after the IPO because they are looking at other stocks that are considered more attractive for now. Also Read: After the IPO, Chemstar (CHEM) Expands the Market to the Cosmetics and F&B Segment. Vice versa with stocks whose prices are already burning. Considering the recent market fluctuations, in the short term there is a chance for a correction to occur. But as long as the issuer's performance and business prospects are still positive, investors tend to accumulate rather than profit taking, so the price is relatively maintained. Even so, Ivan reminded him to be careful when entering into new stocks whose prices have soared considerably. ""It's better to wait for the release of the performance, especially if the valuation is quite high, especially for stocks that have not experienced a significant correction,"" said Ivan. In the midst of a market trend that is prone to selling pressure, Ivan suggested that the portion of the investment portfolio is also directed to bigcap stocks. For now, it's best not to be aggressive while observing market developments. ""Take advantage of every rebound to get short-term profits while slowly filling the portfolio with selected stocks,"" said Ivan. Jimmy had a similar record. Jimmy suggested that investors should pay attention to market conditions which tend to be volatile this year, so don't be too aggressive towards IPO shares if you don't understand the fundamental conditions. Associate Director of Research and Investment Pilarmas Investindo Sekuritas Maximilianus Nico Demus also highlighted the high market interest in IPO shares. The attraction is, the opportunity to gain money is felt to be bigger. Also Read: Listening to Dewi Shri Farmindo's (DEWI) Business Development Plan After the IPO ""Even though no one knows when the stock will go up or down. But we can find out where it is going. What's important is how confident investors are in the stock,"" said Nico . Nico emphasized that this belief must come from careful consideration of the fundamental condition and valuation of the company, as well as the business sector that is inline with the direction of government policies or the global situation. For this year, Nico sees non-cyclical consumers, healthcare, commodities, and energy as still attractive sectors to look at. Meanwhile, MNC Sekuritas Technical Analyst Herditya Wicaksana favors the mining sector, as it is influenced by high commodity prices. ADMR shares can still be collected by observing the support at Rp. 1,455 and resistance at Rp. 1,800. Then, technically there is a chance for SEMA stock to strengthen even in the short term. You can watch the support area at Rp 176 and resistance at Rp 198. Ivan also supports ADMR shares with a target price at Rp 1,850.

China slashed the quarantine time for inbound travellers by half in a major easing of one of the world's strictest COVID-19 curbs, which have deterred cross-border travel and resulted in international flights running at just 2% of pre-pandemic levels. Saudi Arabia's benchmark index leapt 2.1%, buoyed by a 3.3% rise in oil behemoth Saudi Aramco and a 3.4% increase in the country's biggest lender Saudi National Bank. Oil prices, a key factor for the Gulf's financial markets, swung higher after China eased quarantine rules, with focus already on tight supply as G7 leaders agreed to study placing price caps on imports of Russian oil and gas. The energy index in the kingdom advanced 3.2%. Dubai's main share index added 1.1%, led by a 1.9% gain in Emirates NBD Bank and a 1.6% rise in sharia-compliant lender Dubai Islamic Bank.

"HONG KONG - China's central leadership has given billionaire Jack Ma's Ant Group a tentative green light to revive its initial public offering (IPO), two sources with knowledge of the matter said, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is easing its crackdown on the tech sector. Ant, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, aims to file a preliminary prospectus for the share offering in Shanghai and Hong Kong as early as next month, the sources said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The fintech giant will need to wait for guidance from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on the specific timing of the prospectus filing, said one of the sources. In a publicly released statement, Ant said there was no plan to relaunch its IPO, without elaborating. It did not respond to Reuters request for comment on whether it had received a green light from Beijing. The company's stock market listing was hastily shelved at the behest of Beijing in November 2020. At the time, it was slated to be valued at around $315 billion and planned to raise $37 billion, which would have been a world record. ""Under the guidance of regulators, we are focused on steadily moving forward with our rectification work and do not have any plan to initiate an IPO,"" Ant said on its WeChat account late on Thursday. Neither the CSRC nor China's State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for central leaders, responded to Reuters' request for comment. Ant wants to keep the IPO revival plans low profile pending a formal announcement, after having attracted regulatory glare in its first attempt back in 2020 with the waves the offering created as the world's largest ever equity float, a separate source with direct knowledge of the matter said. Chinese authorities pulled the plug on the IPO and cracked down on Ma's business empire after he gave a speech in Shanghai in October 2020 accusing financial watchdogs of stifling innovation. The IPO's derailment marked the start of a regulatory crackdown to rein in China's huge homegrown technology sector, which spread to other industries, including property and private education, wiping billions off market capitalisations and triggering layoffs at some firms. With its economy slowing in a politically sensitive year when Xi Jinping is expected to secure an unprecedented third term as party leader, Beijing is looking to loosen it grip on private businesses including tech giants to help it meet a growth target of 5.5%, something economists have said will be hard to reach given COVID-19 lockdowns. ""They are rolling back on their crackdown to counterbalance the lockdown they've had. Any data out of China lately has been dreadful because of lockdowns and the last thing they want to do is compound that issue. In the next three to six months we are likely to see China's crackdown unwound,"" said David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital in London. A revival of the IPO may also mark a rehabilitation of sorts for Ma, who has been maintaining a low public profile since Beijing swooped. EASING EFFORTS Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He last month told tech executives the government supported the development of the sector and will back firms pursuing listings at home and abroad. In another sign of Beijing's softer stance, China's ride-hailer Didi Global, which has been under a cybersecurity probe since last year, is in advanced talks to buy a third of a state-backed electric-vehicle maker, Reuters reported on Wednesday. News of the talks comes after the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Chinese regulators are set to conclude their investigations into Didi, which could offer more hope to investors about its recovery. Bloomberg reported earlier on Thursday that Chinese financial regulators had started early stage talks on a potential revival of Ant's stock market debut, without mentioning a timeline. The top securities regulator had established a team to reassess the share sale plans, Bloomberg reported. The regulator later said in a statement it had not conducted any assessment or research work regarding an Ant IPO. The U.S. listed shares of Alibaba, which owns nearly one-third of Ant, were down 7% after earlier rising as much as 7% in pre-market trading on the Bloomberg report. U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus, a big investor in Ant's 2018 private fundraising, lowered its valuation of Ant to about $180 billion at end-March from $221 billion one year earlier, a separate source said. The regulators have directed Ant to restructure as a financial rather than tech firm, and sources and analysts have said the financial sector typically carries lower valuations. Warburg Pincus declined to comment on Thursday. ""The size of Ant and the IPO will have to be smaller than what was planned in 2020 because the market conditions have changed and cannot be compared to now,"" said Dickie Wong, executive director of Kingston Securities in Hong Kong. U.S.-listed shares of Chinese tech and e-commerce firms including Didi and Alibaba have gained this week on hints Beijing's one-and-a-half year long crackdown may be easing.

"NEW YORK - Investment banks have raked in billions of dollars by feeding the frenzy for blank-check companies, and they have done so largely without risking any of their own money on hundreds of deals that have left many investors with punishing losses. A look at one of these deals shows how. In late 2020, Acies Acquisition Corp tapped into investor demand for blank-check companies – formally known as special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs – with an initial public offering that raised $215 million. Among the investment banks Acies signed up to underwrite the IPO were JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer & Co. When the offering closed, Acies, essentially a shell company, followed the SPAC template. With the cash it had raised, it had two years to find and merge with a private company seeking a stock market listing, or return the money to investors. Acies’ management team announced it was on the hunt for a business in the “experiential entertainment industry.” The team didn’t have to look for very long. Hours after the IPO closed, bankers advising Playstudios Inc contacted Acies managers to tell them the Las Vegas-based maker of mobile casino games was for sale, regulatory filings show. Those bankers were also with JPMorgan. In early 2021, the two companies announced plans for a merger that valued Playstudios at $1.1 billion. In the run-up to the merger and the listing of the combined company’s shares, Playstudios touted a rosy future. It forecast that surging ad sales, a new role-playing game and cross-marketing offerings to game players would bring a 20% rise in revenue in 2021 and a 33% jump this year. Since then, the company has scrapped the new game, and revenue fell far short of predictions. Retail investors suffered the consequences. The stock is down more than 50% since shareholders approved the merger last June. “Playstudios is one that looks like crap right now,” Dan Ushman, a 37-year-old Chicago-area entrepreneur, said earlier this year. He put about $26,000 into Acies after it announced its deal with Playstudios and soon saw his investment drop more than 35%. Investment banks involved in the deal fared much better, having risked none of their own money, based on a Reuters review of regulatory filings. JPMorgan, in particular, pocketed hefty fees for its dual role as an underwriter for the Acies IPO and as an adviser to Playstudios – perfectly legal, despite the apparent conflict of interest, if the bank discloses its role, as JPMorgan did. The bank has not disclosed its fees, but financial data provider Refinitiv estimates that JPMorgan earned $4.7 million in underwriting fees and $14.2 million as a sell-side adviser. It also received $1.6 million for helping Acies raise additional capital through a maneuver known as private investment in public equity, or PIPE, according to financial research firm Morningstar Inc and a Reuters analysis. PIPEs, which tap big institutional investors, are often necessary to close a SPAC merger. Morgan Stanley earned about $5.9 million and Oppenheimer about $1.2 million in underwriting fees, according to Refinitiv estimates. Each bank also got about $1.6 million in PIPE-related fees, according to Morningstar and a Reuters analysis. LionTree Advisors, another Playstudios adviser, earned $6.2 million on the deal, according to Refinitiv estimates, plus $1.6 million in PIPE fees, according to Morningstar and a Reuters analysis. JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and LionTree declined to comment. An Oppenheimer spokesman said the bank had a minor role in the Acies IPO. Playstudios noted that the JPMorgan teams it and Acies worked with came from separate divisions of the bank. The company said it has “a robust framework for evaluating, approving, executing and optimizing its game initiatives,” and that it is continually “revisiting the conditions and decision to either advance or suspend an initiative.” A CURIOUS PATTERN The disparate outcomes of the Acies-Playstudios deal – big bucks for the investment banks that sold it and big losses for retail investors who bought into it – are typical of many SPAC deals. For this article, Reuters analyzed hundreds of SPACs spanning roughly two years, reviewed banks’ internal documents and regulatory filings, and interviewed more than two dozen bankers, investors, SPAC managers, lawyers and corporate executives. The examination found that investment banks turbocharged to their benefit what turned out to be a speculative bubble in companies that have often failed to live up to their pre-listing hype. The SPAC market has sagged since the collapse of some high-profile blank-check listings amid overall grim market conditions. And in March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed new rules that would increase disclosure requirements and potential legal liability for SPACs and their banks. Facing these market and regulatory challenges, some banks have been pulling back from the business. Whatever happens to the SPAC market, the Reuters examination reveals in detail for the first time how, over the past couple of years, Wall Street banks have enriched themselves by aggressively promoting the deals in the absence of the legal guardrails and financial risks associated with traditional IPOs. Credit Suisse summed it up last year in a confidential client presentation reviewed by Reuters: SPACs “bend the rules” of the IPO market. The Swiss bank has had a role in 136 blank-check deals since the beginning of 2020 through the end of March, according to a Reuters analysis of SPAC Research data. A Credit Suisse spokesperson said the language in the presentation pertains to SPAC “market conventions” that give companies and investors more flexibility than in traditional IPOs. The bank is committed to “recommending strategies that conform to all applicable rules,” the spokesperson said. In a traditional IPO, underwriters can be held responsible under securities law for any misleading forecasts, projections or other statements made to investors. To protect themselves against liability, banks perform rigorous due diligence on companies whose IPOs they underwrite, and those companies generally do not issue public forecasts about their performance. Banks also buy big chunks of an issuing company’s new shares, risking losses if they can’t resell the stock for more than they paid. With a SPAC, a bank's role as underwriter ends once the blank-check company completes its IPO, but the bank receives a portion of its fee only after the SPAC makes an acquisition. By the time the SPAC announces a merger, SPAC underwriters aren’t responsible for forecasts and other claims about the performance of the company to be acquired and publicly listed. And because blank-check IPOs are typically priced at a nominal $10, banks don't run the risk of having to sell new shares that fall in value. For investment banks, blank-check deals create “moral hazard” – an incentive to take on risk because of little exposure to it – according to Usha Rodrigues, a law professor at the University of Georgia who studies SPACs. That’s because they “don’t have the same liability with a SPAC that they have with a traditional IPO, but banks do get to collect fees if they can get a deal done,” she said. The “companies that merged with SPACs … don’t have the same level of vetting,” which most retail investors do not realize. Shares of companies that obtained a stock market listing in a SPAC merger from 2019 through the beginning of March were down roughly 36% on average from when their deals closed, according to data provided by Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida. That’s even worse than the 14% decline in shares of companies that went public through traditional IPOs during the same period, according to Nasdaq Inc. All told, according to Vanda Research, retail investors lost $4.8 billion, or 23%, of the aggregate $21.3 billion they plowed into SPACs from the beginning of 2020 to the first week of April 2022. Yet the deals that brought those shares to market have yielded a bonanza for investment banks. Industry tracker Coalition Greenwich estimates that banks booked about $8 billion in SPAC-related fees in 2020 and 2021. That represents roughly 6.5% of total U.S. investment banking fees that major banks collected in that period, according to Coalition Greenwich. “The bank has an incentive to push the deal to get closed, at any price, because they want their 3.5% of the SPAC IPO proceeds,” said Mike Stegemoller, a professor of banking and finance at Baylor University, referring to the fees underwriters receive only after a SPAC merger closes. “I think the conflict is with retail investors who are buying common shares of stock … Do you really think banks care about these retail investors? I think there are good incentives not to.” Many banks amped up their take by working for both sides of deals, as JPMorgan did with Acies and Playstudios. Reuters identified roughly 50 such cases from early 2020 to November 2021. SOURED SENTIMENT As the SPAC bubble has deflated, debate over responsibility for investor losses has focused on the executives of blank-check companies. These founding investors – referred to as sponsors – risk losing all of their investment if they can’t find a company to take public through a merger within the two-year window. However, founders acquire their shares at deep discounts to the typical $10 offering price, thanks to preferential treatment and fees that can dilute retail investors’ holdings. Likewise, the hedge funds and other institutional investors that account for a lot of the money behind SPACs often obtain their shares in an IPO or subsequent PIPE under favorable terms that put them at an advantage relative to retail investors. The SEC put SPACs on notice last year with several enforcement actions against specific companies and their sponsors for allegedly misleading investors about their prospects. Then, in late March, the regulator announced its proposed rules, which would, among other things, establish that investment banks that underwrite SPACs could be held legally liable for false or misleading forecasts or statements about blank-check deals. The SEC will vote on the rules after the public-comment period ends later this spring. The SEC declined to comment. In a March 30 statement on the proposed rules, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said “gatekeepers” such as underwriters “should have to stand behind and be responsible for basic aspects of their work” and “provide an essential function to police fraud and ensure the accuracy of disclosure to investors.” In its proposed rules, the SEC said that the fees underwriting banks receive when a SPAC closes a deal could indicate participation in the merger, and that banks also have a “strong financial interest” in making sure a SPAC inks a deal. For these reasons, the regulator said, it is proposing increasing banks’ liability. To date, investors have not sought to hold major Wall Street banks responsible for false or misleading information alleged in any of the 47 SPAC-related class action shareholder lawsuits filed since 2021, according to a Reuters analysis of a public database maintained by Stanford Law School and attorney Kevin LaCroix, who follows the cases. None of those cases have yet succeeded in court. One aspect of SPACs that has already drawn regulatory scrutiny is undisclosed dealings between blank-check companies and their targets before a merger is announced. That’s because investors could be misled if a SPAC privately shakes hands with an acquisition target while publicly stating it is still seeking the best possible merger partner. Communications between a SPAC and its acquisition target are part of an SEC investigation of former U.S. President Donald Trump's $1.25 billion deal, announced last October, to list his new social media venture on the stock market. In a December filing, Digital World Acquisition Corp, the SPAC that is merging with the former president’s Trump Media & Technology Group, disclosed that the SEC had asked for documents relating to communications between Digital World and Trump Media and meetings of Digital World's board, among other things. The SEC stated in its request that its investigation did not mean the agency had concluded that anyone violated the law, Digital World said. Trump Media has since launched the Truth Social platform to lackluster effect. Trump Media and Digital World Acquisition Corp did not respond to requests for comment. The SEC declined to comment. In the Acies-Playstudios deal, pre-existing relationships raise the question of whether the two companies already had a merger in mind, potentially precluding better deals for investors. Acies told investors when it launched its IPO that it had not identified a company to merge with and that it would pursue the best opportunity it could find. However, Andrew Pascal, chief executive officer of Playstudios, co-founded Acies with Jim Murren, who was chief executive officer of MGM Resorts Inc when that casino operator invested in Playstudios, as was disclosed in a securities filing. Playstudios said it “considered all viable SPAC proposals and eventually made the decision it believed was the best of the available options for the company.” Responding to Reuters inquiries on behalf of Murren and Pascal, Playstudios noted that MGM Resorts, not Murren personally, invested in the company, and that Pascal recused himself from ""all Acies deliberations concerning Playstudios"" once talks began and ""forfeited his economic interest in Acies to avoid even the appearance of having conflicting interests."" BACKWATER TO BONANZA For decades, SPACs were a backwater of Wall Street, connecting speculators with companies that had no other means of going public. That changed in late 2019 and early 2020, when shares of Richard Branson’s spaceflight provider Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc and sports betting operator DraftKings Inc surged more than 600% after going public through SPAC mergers. Investors stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and flush with cash from government stimulus payments helped drive those gains, and they clamored for more. Wall Street banks were happy to oblige and began aggressively promoting the business. In client presentations and other documents reviewed by Reuters, they repeatedly acknowledged the tainted reputation of SPACs and boasted of their ability to bring quality companies to market through blank-check deals. In a 2020 presentation, Morgan Stanley said there was a “historical perception of lower quality companies picking (the) SPAC route, although views have improved somewhat.” For its part, Morgan Stanley said it associated “only with the highest quality partners.” Some of its past partners include Acies, the SPAC that brought Playstudios to market. Shares of the 51 companies that Morgan Stanley has helped take public through SPACs either as an adviser or by raising money to close the deal since the beginning of 2020 were down 28% on average through late March, according to a Reuters analysis. Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the presentation and the performance of shares in companies that went public through its SPACs. Citigroup, in a 2019 presentation, said that while SPACs historically had been considered a “four-letter” word, synonymous with poor outcomes, that perception was changing as investors’ appetite for new alternatives grew. Companies that Citi helped bring to market through SPACs since 2020, either as an adviser or by raising money to close the deal, were down 38% on average at the beginning of May, according to a Reuters analysis of SPAC Research data. Among its many deals, Citi was an underwriter for the IPO of a SPAC called Spartan Acquisition Corp II and an adviser to the company Spartan subsequently acquired, Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc, a financier of solar energy systems. The bank helped Spartan determine its valuation of Sunlight at $1.3 billion, based on Sunlight’s own profit estimates, securities filings show. Sunlight later slashed its profit estimates. The shares, after peaking at about $14.33 in early 2021, are now trading at less than $5. Citi and Sunlight declined to comment. Credit Suisse, in a fourth-quarter 2020 presentation to corporate clients, pointed out that the latitude companies enjoy when issuing business forecasts in SPAC deals can “help improve investor perception of the company.” That would be particularly helpful, it said, for companies that “may have struggled to go public via a traditional IPO.” In the same presentation, Credit Suisse highlighted the “creative marketing tactics” it used in the Virgin Galactic deal. These included flying investors and analysts to tour Virgin Galactic’s factory and Spaceport America complex, which the bank said added “a ‘wow’ factor that a regular-way IPO process could not have provided.” When Virgin Galactic went public, it wasn’t generating any revenue. Its shares soared in the months after the listing, peaking at $62.80. They subsequently tumbled amid delays in some product testing and are now trading below $10. In a 2021 presentation, Credit Suisse asserted that the surge in blank-check deals was being driven by “high quality sponsors” that “seek to partner with blue-chip assets.” Quality aside, share prices of the 56 companies Credit Suisse helped bring to market through SPACs in the past two years were down on average about 32% at the end of March, according to a Reuters analysis of data from SPAC Research. A Credit Suisse spokesperson said the bank is “very selective when it comes to choosing SPAC clients,” and that it treats SPAC mergers “much the same way as regular IPOs” in terms of the bank’s internal approval process. When working for a company that could merge with a SPAC, the bank evaluates alternatives and helps identify the “most suitable course of action,” regardless of whether Credit Suisse underwrote the blank-check firm’s IPO, the spokesperson said. Virgin Galactic declined to comment. Another company Credit Suisse helped bring to market is Paysafe Ltd. The online payments platform was valued at $9 billion in a March 2021 merger with a SPAC. Credit Suisse had underwritten the SPAC’s IPO and acted as an adviser to Paysafe on the subsequent merger. The $9 billion valuation was based in part on Paysafe’s forecast that its digital wallets business would see double-digit growth from 2020 to 2023. Securities filings show that banks were involved in discussions on establishing the valuation. After Paysafe went public, it had to write down its digital wallets business and make technological improvements to it. The shares are down more than 80% from their January 2021 peak. Paysafe decided to go public through a SPAC because it was the “best route to take to public markets,” and hired Credit Suisse because it had worked with the bank on prior deals, according to a company spokesperson. Paysafe has put in place a turnaround plan for its digital wallets business that is “well underway” to “deliver on a new growth trajectory,” the spokesperson said. A representative for Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II, the SPAC that acquired Paysafe, declined to comment. WAITING IN THE WINGS The deal that took car retailer CarLotz Inc public underscores the aggressive tactics banks adopted in their pursuit of SPACs. The Richmond, Virginia-based company, which sells used cars on consignment online and through retail outlets, began looking for a buyer through a conventional sale in late 2019 but failed to find one at the $1 billion price it wanted, a source familiar with the matter said. Several months later, Deutsche Bank pitched itself as a sell-side adviser to CarLotz, pledging to find a SPAC buyer, according to a person familiar with the situation. The bank sought SPAC buyers that would value CarLotz at a minimum of $750 million, based on the $730 million paid for rival Shift Technologies Inc in a recent SPAC merger, and possibly as much as $2 billion, a source familiar with the matter said. And Deutsche Bank already had a bidder waiting in the wings, a SPAC called Acamar Partners Acquisition Corp. Deutsche Bank had advised Acamar as an underwriter on its launch more than a year earlier, and the blank-check company was running out of time to secure a merger. Less than a month after CarLotz hired Deutsche Bank, the bank suggested to Acamar that it make an offer for CarLotz, according to regulatory filings. Acamar made a winning offer of $827 million, less than CarLotz had hoped for, but beating out two other bidders, the filings show. In anticipation of its stock market listing, CarLotz started wooing investors with glowing forecasts. It projected it would have almost $1 billion in sales in 2022, nearly nine times its estimated 2020 revenue. It could meet demand, it said, from a diverse supplier base of used cars from corporate fleets. About seven months later, a supplier representing more than 60% of CarLotz’s cars sold in the prior quarter paused its relationship with the company. Sales dried up. Revenue for 2021 came to only $259 million. CarLotz shares are down more than 90% since they were listed, giving the company a market value of less than $100 million. Deutsche Bank did far better. It received fees of approximately $6.7 million as an underwriter and $14.1 million as an adviser, according to Refinitiv estimates. CarLotz and Acamar did not respond to requests for comment. In an interview, Eric Hackel, head of equity origination solutions at Deutsche Bank, declined to comment on the CarLotz deal specifically. In general, he said, the bank’s due diligence for a traditional IPO is “a little bit more thorough” than for a SPAC, but it does “a tremendous amount of diligence on companies we underwrite.” On deals for which the bank is advising the private company and has also underwritten the SPAC acquiring it, “there’s usually another bank advising,” Hackel said. Ultimately, he said, “it’s up to the company” if they hire the same bank that underwrote the SPAC to advise them on a deal. He noted that retail investors enjoy some of the protections institutional investors have – such as the right to redeem shares for $10 before a deal closes. However, once a deal is done, Hackel said, retail investors “have to make their own decisions. They have to do their own diligence.” Kyle Brown, a 30-year-old accountant in Groton, Connecticut, invested in CarLotz. “We lost the totality of our investment with the exception of $35,” he said. “It was about $11,000, $12,000.” Brown had hoped his investment would help pay for a new house, but he ended up having to find other ways to fund a down payment.

"“A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you’re talking real money,” the late US Senator Everett Dirksen once said, mainly with reference to out-of-control federal spending in America. It was a snarky understatement to emphasise not just wasteful government spending, but also the value of a billion dollars, which, expressed numerically, is 1 followed by nine zeroes — as in, US $1,000,000,000. Although the world’s first billion-dollar company (US Steel) announced itself in 1901, and the world’s first billionaire (John Rockefeller of Standard Oil) was minted in 1916, even in the 1950s, when Dirksen was said to have made the comment, a billion was big, big bucks. Today, a billion dollars — or even a million dollars for that matter — is still a lot of money for an individual. There are approximately 2,800 known billionaires — and many unknown — in the world, a list currently led by Tesla’s Elon Musk, with an estimated wealth of $280bln. But in corporate terms, it is becoming chump change. Companies founded on a whim and prayer, or an app and hope, acquire valuation of a billion dollars in quick time, often based on speculative hope and hype. In an era of easy come-easy go, some endure, many do not. Dubbed Unicorns, a term first popularised by venture capitalist Aileen Lee after the mythical animal to represent the statistical rarity of such successful ventures, they have become a fairly common measure of entrepreneurial fizz. In 2013, when the term was first used to describe startups that scaled up quickly to a billion dollars, there were less than 40 unicorns, mainly in the US. Today, there are an estimated 1,000 unicorns across the world, including 300 in China and 100 in India. Some 30 unicorns, including already-famous names such as SpaceX, Instacart, Stripe, and ByteDance, each valued between $10bln and $100bln, have been given the name Decacorn. Scaling further up, Decacorns become Hectocorns when they are valued at over $100bln. Up until this stage, Unicorns, Decacorns, and Hectocorns are startup companies that are private, venture-backed entities, recognised and evaluated for their potential for growth, and not on their financial performance. Riding on “get big fast” (GBF) strategies, also known as Blitzscaling, these startups try to expand at a high rate through large funding rounds and price cutting to gain an advantage on market share and overrun competitors as quickly as possible. In pursuit of this foothold or market share, many of them don’t make a dime in profit; instead, they burn money to get ahead. Facebook was the first Decacorn and Hectocorn in history, crossing a $100bln valuation before it went public (once they go public with an IPO, they no longer qualify for the informal -corn suffix). It was followed by China’s Alibaba. ByteDance, owners of the app TikTok, which is backed by investors such as Sequoia Capital China and Softbank Group among others, is a current Decacorn, valued at over $140bln — more than the current market cap of storied companies such as AT&T and American Express. Since Facebook became the first privately-held Decacorn-turned-Hectocorn, a $100bln-plus privately-held company, an additional 84 Decacorns have been created. Not all have survived, with 33 of them losing their status for various reasons. This leaves 51 companies still straining at the leash to go public, whereupon they enter new terrain. They include names such as India’s Byju’s, currently valued at $21bln, making it the world’s most valuable education technology startup, and China’s Yuanfudao, also an edtech startup valued at $15.5bln. While Unicorns and Decacorns grow through large funding rounds from private venture capital firms and investors to get an early foothold in the marketplace, sitting on top of the pyramid are companies that do go public and scale a stratospheric height of a trillion dollars — companies for which there is still no agreed upon term as yet. The name Pegasus has been suggested for such companies which reach the new valuation pinnacle of $1trln (like the unicorn, the pegasus is also a mythical horse, but with wind beneath its wings). Collectively, they are simply known as Big Tech. They are the T company. The market cap of $1trln A trillion is no trifling sum. For starters, it is 1 followed by 12 zeroes — as in $1,000,000,000,000. A trillion dollars is greater than the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of all but a score of countries. It is greater than the GDP of Switzerland, Sweden and Argentina, each with GDP below one trillion dollars in nominal terms. For that matter, the valuation of Apple, which recently crossed $3trln (it has since dropped to about $2.65trln at the time of writing), nudged the GDP of Great Britain and India, two of the larger economies of the world. Today, there are around half-a-dozen companies in the world that have a market cap of over $1trln. All but Saudi Aramco are US-born and US-based, and each has a tech orientation. As of March 31, 2022, they are led by Apple ($2.85trln), followed by Microsoft ($2.31trln), Alphabet/ Google ($1.84trln), Amazon ($1.65trln), and, the most recent addition to the list, Tesla ($1.1trln). Couple others have crossed the 1-T mark or nibbled at it and receded — notably PetroChina and Meta/Facebook. The rise, rise, and rise of US tech companies has also led to growing concerns about ‘Big Tech’ — an analogous recall of market dominance by a few companies in other market sectors such as Big Oil and Big Pharma. For instance, the big five tech stocks, originally dubbed FAAMG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google) and now TAAMG (with Tesla replacing Facebook, which has lost nearly 30 per cent of its valuation), account for about a quarter of the market capitalisation of the entire 500 companies in Standard&Poor’s 500. This effectively means 1% of the companies in the index account for about 25% of the total market value. Such market concentration isn’t unusual. In fact, some companies in the past represented an even bigger share of the market. Back in 1932, AT&T accounted for 13% of total US stock market value, more than twice Apple’s approximately 6% share of the current S&P value (about $ 40 trillion). Even further back, in 1928, General Motors represented 8% of the market, and, in 1970, IBM 7%. But there is a big difference in the time and pace of how the modern Big Tech became bellwethers. While four of the five American companies hit the $1trln market cap before the pandemic, what is remarkable is that the onset of Covid-19 — which lowered the boom on many traditional legacy companies — powered Big Tech to even greater heights. For instance, Apple, which hit $1trln market cap on August 2, 2018, doubled that in just two years, going up to $2trln on August 19, 2020, in the middle of the pandemic. It took even less time to breach $3trln (on January 3, 2022) before receding slightly. Similarly, Microsoft went from breaching $1 trillion in June 2019 to surpassing $2trln in June 2021, and Google went from scaling 1-T in January 2020 to topping 2-T in November 2021. So, what gives? How and why did this happen, particularly during a pandemic? The pandemic and the online giants To begin with, even in the pre-pandemic economy, four members of the Trillion Dollar Club (Tesla came late to the party) dominated their respective market: Apple in smartphones, Microsoft in cloud computing, Alphabet/Google in Internet advertising, and Amazon in online retail. When the pandemic kicked in, the stay- work- and buy-from-home economy brought rich rewards to these companies. While the already besieged brick-and-mortar companies collapsed, the online giants boomed, helped in addition by stimulus payments that put money in people’s pockets on top of low interest rates. Apple and Microsoft sales of IT products and cloud services soared, as did Amazon retailing and Google services, as people spent more and more time indoors and online. In many ways, the pandemic helped clarify a trend that was already becoming apparent before Covid-19 struck. Rewind or flashback 25 years, and you will see that the top 10 companies in terms of market cap were a mix of oil, food, pharma, and technology, all valued between $100 million and $220 million. In 1997, the list of most valued companies in the world read General Electric, Royal Dutch, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Coca Cola, Intel, Nippon, Merck Toyota, and Novartis. Up until even a decade ago, five of the top ten publicly listed companies in terms of market cap were oil companies, with Exxon Mobil and PetroChina leading the way. There were only two tech companies in the list — Apple at #3 and Microsoft at #10. In fact, PetroChina, a Chinese oil and gas company, an arm of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, became the first company to roar past the $1 trillion mark in 2007, a decade before Apple rang up its first trillion in market cap. In January 2007, just as PetroChina was nearing the $1 trillion valuation, Apple introduced its first iPhone, when the company was still shy of being $100 billion (it was worth $73.4 billion at that point). Introducing the iPhone, Apple founder Steve Jobs promised a “leapfrog product” that would be “way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, super easy to use”. As it turned out, not only did Apple reinvent the phone, it reinvented the market. In the years to come, the iPhone would become one of history’s best-selling products, racking up (most recently) sales of more $200 billion annually within a decade. The device has now become so ubiquitous that television presenter Jason Silva, paraphrasing the philosopher Descartes, joked “iPhone, therefore I am”. Signs that the iPhone would power Apple to the top spot became clear as early as 2012, when it displaced ExxonMobil as the world’s most valuable company, with PetroChina slipping to third place. The new-age ‘pinnacle’ In the decade since, Apple has never lost that pole position — except in 2019, when Microsoft briefly toppled it. Founded in 1974, just a few months before Apple by Jobs’ contemporary Bill Gates, Microsoft is another money-spinning behemoth, often ranked with Apple as one of the most profitable companies in the world. Just as Apple reinvented the phone, and itself, with the iPhone, Microsoft relaunched itself with cloud computing, the biggest revenue source for a company that was a byword for software. Relative to Apple and Microsoft, which are of mid-1970s vintage, Amazon and Facebook were founded in the 1990s; Tesla is even newer, founded only in 2003. But each has carved a niche in the market in its area, with rivals at a distant second. By early this year, Big Tech had completely trumped traditional companies, with eight of the ten most valued companies in the world all belonging to the tech stable: Apple, Microsoft, Google /Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla occupying top five positions, with Nvidia, Meta/Facebook, and TSMC in the 5-10 slot. The only exceptions were Berkshire Hathaway at #6 and United Health at #10. So, are the T-companies really worth all that much, how much further can they — and will they — grow? What propelled them to such dizzy heights and will they survive? These are questions that haunt every market maven as the world teeters on the brink of the twin crisis of war and pestilence. The recent tumult over the hostile bid for Twitter, and the meltdown of Netflix stock, has raised new questions on valuation. But one thing looks certain, at least in our lifetime: the trillion-dollar pinnacle is the new summit large companies will aspire to climb. Copyright © 2022 Khaleej Times. All Rights Reserved.

"Dubai: With 38 GCC market debuts, 2021 was the best year for new listings since 2007. Yet, the high volume of listings disguises the reality that only one-third are successful. Specifically, just 38% of IPOs were priced adequately - the majority of companies leave too much money on the table. Only 32% of companies traded within the typically desired share price range of 20% within the first 30 days of going public. And merely 31% of new listings outperform companies that are already listed in the longer term. These are among the findings of a new report published by Iridium Advisors, entitled “The Renaissance of IPOs in the GCC,” that examines the success rate of company listing and demystifies some common misconceptions about IPO winners and losers. Iridium’s analysis of 457 initial public offerings in the GCC region between 2005 and 2021, benchmarked companies against three objective criteria of success: 1. Underpricing: the difference between the IPO offer price and the first-day closing price 2. Stabilization period: the 30-day period of price stabilization post-listing 3. Excess return: the relative company share price versus a country index over time “It is very encouraging to see government-owned and private companies embracing public equity markets in the GCC,” says Oliver Schutzmann, CEO of Iridium Advisors and a co-author of the report. “With a well-thought-out program of new public listings, which is already underway, the region has the opportunity to re-energize its capital markets and attract foreign capital to diversify economic growth. Nevertheless, there is still a big mountain to climb to unlock the true capital markets potential of listed companies for both issuers and investors.” Companies planning a public listing need to be aware of the high probability of disappointment and ask why this should be the case. Iridium’s analysis has identified three key areas that are commonly overlooked by company owners, directors and senior management that can play a part in improving the odds of success: 1. There are different dynamics at play in the primary and secondary market: Successful issuers recognize that investors trade among themselves in the secondary market without any direct involvement from the company, and that their company is only worth as much as the last share price. 2.  There is a difference between pre-IPO and post-IPO investors: Companies whose share price outperforms its benchmark after the listing understand that there are different types of investors with varying motivations and interests. 3. The assumption that Public Relations and Investor Relations are synonymous could lead to failure: While both PR and IR have an important role to play, PR features more prominently before and after an IPO, while IR often tends to remain an afterthought. Schutzmann concludes by adding: “The risk of value destruction is real for private and public sector companies in the GCC preparing for an IPO, SPAC, or a direct listing in 2022. It is, however, not inevitable. Key areas of focus to improve the chances of success are taking a long-term view in pre-IPO preparation, identifying the right type of investor, and developing the capability to create organic relationships with the professional investment community. These three steps can guard against major share price gyrations after a listing and will go a long way to ensure that the region’s companies – and their owners - are rewarded with the right valuation by the market.” A copy of the report can be downloaded here.

"Kuwait: Kuwait Financial Centre “Markaz” recently released its Monthly Market Review report for the month of March 2022. In line with its GCC peers, Kuwait’s all share index gained 6.7% in the month of March, supported by a rise in oil prices. Oil prices, which were a major driving factor for the GCC stock market performance, crossed USD 120 per barrel mark in the month of March. Among sectors, Boursa Kuwait’s Banking sector was the top gainer, rising 9.9% followed by financial services sector at 5.3%. Healthcare sector had the biggest decline in the month and Energy sector index declined, falling 5.3%. Among Premier Market stocks, National Investments Company and Boursa Kuwait were the top gainers during the month, rising 23.7% and 14.3% respectively. Inflation in Kuwait rose to 4.37% YoY driven by rising prices of food and housing services, in the month of February 2022. Kuwait's government is taking cautious measures to keep critical commodity prices in check and has halted all grain exports for the next three months. Central Bank of Kuwait has raised its main interest rates by 25 bps in March, subsequent to the interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve and Kuwaiti banks are expected to be benefitted by this interest rate hike. Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain have also increased their policy rates by 25 bps. Kuwait’s M2 money supply expanded 1.9% YoY in January, and bank lending to the private sector grew by 6.8% YoY in the same month. Kuwaiti bank revenues grew 7.1% in 2021 with profits almost doubling to $2.9 billion driven by increase in revenues as well as decline in loan loss provisions. According to Moody’s, Kuwaiti Islamic Banks have recorded the fourth best growth rate in financing operations, globally, during the period 2019-Q3 2021.  Ali Alghanim & Sons whose businesses include car dealerships, construction and electronics has filed to list on Boursa Kuwait and the company is expected to sell a 45% stake in the listing, as per Bloomberg. Regionally, S&P GCC composite index rose by 4.8% for the month, driven by upward oil price momentum. All GCC markets gained for the month. Abu Dhabi and Bahrain equity indices were the biggest gainers among GCC, rising 6.8% and 5.6% respectively over the month. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman equity indices also marked a gain of 4.5%, 4.0% and 3.7% respectively over the month. Among the GCC blue chip companies, the best performer was First Abu Dhabi Bank, which gained 14.6% during the month. Due to a sharp increase in oil prices and robust domestic demand, Saudi Arabia's real GDP increased by 6.7 percent year on year in Q4 2021. S&P upgraded Saudi Arabia's outlook from stable to positive, as it expects improved GDP growth and fiscal dynamics in the medium term, improved oil sector prospects and the Government’s reform programs. The IPO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) opened for subscription on March 24, intends to float 17% and could raise as much as USD 5.7billion. Developed markets ended positive for the month with MSCI world gaining 2.5%, S&P 500 gaining 3.6%, Japan’s topix gaining 3.2% and UK’s FTSE gaining 0.8%. US inflation increased 7.9% y/y in Feb 2022, recording a fresh 40-year high mainly driven by rising food and fuel costs. U.S. Treasury yields jumped during the month, with the benchmark 10-year note surging from 1.82% (February end) to 2.35%. In February 2022, the unemployment rate in the US fell to a two-year low of 3.8% as job growth soared. The Bank of England has hiked interest rates three times in a row, returning Bank Rate to its pre-pandemic level of 0.75%. Oil prices were up 6.9% for March 2022 due to supply tightness and United States is considering the release of up to 180 million barrels from its strategic petroleum reserve over several months to calm soaring crude prices. The United States has stated that it will work to supply 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the European Union this year to help reduce their reliance on Russian energy supplies. -Ends- About Kuwait Financial Centre “Markaz” Established in 1974, Kuwait Financial Centre K.P.S.C “Markaz” is one of the leading asset management and investment banking institutions in the MENA region with total assets under management of over KD 1.04 billion as of 31 December 2021.

Ashishkumar Chauhan is not new to the National Stock Exchange of India; he was part of the core team that set up the exchange back in 1992-1993. Chauhan spent eight years at NSE before he left to join Reliance Industries Ltd.Yet, Chauhan's return to NSE, at a time when the exchange's relationship with the regulator is seen to be at an all-time low, poses the biggest challenge for a veteran who was instrumental in setting up screen-based trading and launching the benchmark Nifty index.To be clear, NSE in 2022 is not the same exchange that Chauhan had left in 2000 when it was in the hands of colleagues who today face regulatory and multi-agency probes.In the second half of these two decades away from NSE, Chauhan has strategised and led a competitive battle against the dominance of the National Stock Exchange, as the CEO of the Bombay Stock Exchange. Despite that enhanced competition and even with all the regulatory troubles it has faced over the same years, NSE has been able to consolidate its market share in some key market segments and grew its revenue and profit three-fold in the five years that Vikram Limaye was CEO. NSE's Tech Strengths And WeaknessesA systemically important market infrastructure institution as the country's largest stock exchange, NSE has been able to consolidate its market share in equity capital markets, equity derivatives and currency derivatives. Soon, it will also transition the Nifty Futures traded on the Singapore Exchange to NSE IFSC Ltd., the international exchange platform set up at GIFT City in Gujarat. This would bring trading volumes—that were hitherto overseas—onshore to India, a move that Chauhan was a signatory to when NSE, BSE, and MSEI released a joint statement in February 2018 to end all licensing deals that involved sharing of product prices with overseas exchanges. The idea was to bring over volumes from Singapore and Dubai and is now a step away from reality.The tech-savvy Chauhan will bring expertise that would be welcome in the process of upgrading NSE's technology platforms. While NSE has its own technology arm that handles core operations. Chauhan will need to ensure a reduction in the technical snags that the NSE has faced frequently in recent years. At BSE, Chauhan ran a low-latency network but that did not prevent NSE from consolidating its position in various segments. Now, NSE gets an insider who knows both exchanges inside-out. Cleaning Up A MinefieldNSE's biggest challenge today is finding a resolution to the co-location and dark fibre probe. The multi-agency investigation has put NSE and its operations and, as a result, whoever has to run the institution in such times, in a constant state of flux.Taking the top job just months after recent orders by SEBI against the exchange's past leaders, would require Chauhan to use all his expertise to untie the knots NSE finds itself in.Chauhan's eventual success would also be gauged on whether he can successfully steer NSE to a long-awaited initial public offering and listing. Five years ago, when Chauhan had applied for the NSE top post, he was in the middle of taking Asia's oldest stock exchange, BSE, public. In comparison, NSE's IPO is not going to be an easy process, as SEBI's confidence in the institution will have to be restored in good measure, for the regulator to allow the IPO to proceed. That appears difficult with the investigations that are underway and in the immediate aftermath of SEBI's recent orders.Chauhan has to mend NSE's image with the regulator and other authorities not just for its IPO, but also to let the exchange be allowed to introduce new cutting-edge products. Chauhan's team at BSE was credited for creating some of the most innovative products introduced at BSE like the BSE StAR MF platform.In each of these aspects, Chauhan will need to deftly navigate the regulatory minefield that the exchange keeps getting caught in.",18/Jul/2022 00:00:00,20/Jul/2022 14:34:08,"In Ashishkumar Chauhan, NSE Gets A Minesweeper To Clear Path To IPO","[the National Stock Exchange, Reliance Industries Ltd., the National Stock Exchange, Reliance Industries Ltd., Nifty, the National Stock Exchange, the Bombay Stock Exchange, NSE, NSE, Nifty Futures, the Singapore Exchange, BSE, MSEI, NSE, NSE, BSE, BSE, NSE, SEBI, NSE, BSE, BSE],[]",https://www.bloombergquint.com/opinion/in-ashishkumar-chauhan-nse-gets-a-minesweeper-to-clear-path-to-ipo

Kyobo Life has been pushing to go public since 2018, but opposition from its shareholders has halted the process for years.

"SEOUL-- ONE store Co., a South Korean mobile app market platform, decided Wednesday to withdraw its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) due to lackluster investor confidence, financial industry sources said.

The No. 2 mobile app market operator here, after Google Play store, received lackluster response from institutional investors during a two-day demand forecasting session until Tuesday, according to the sources. Institutional bids reportedly mostly fell below the company's desired pricing band between 34,300 won ($27) and 41,700 won.

""Just this morning, ONE store considered going public by lowering the desired price, but they apparently decided to scrap the plan after concluding the company's value may not be properly recognized by the market under the current stock market situation,"" a source said.

ONE store's affiliate SK shieldus also nixed its IPO plan last week due to weak investor sentiment.

Lee Jae-hwan, CEO of ONE store, said in a press conference on Monday that the company was determined to get listed on the main bourse as planned this month, undeterred by the sister company's derailed attempt.

ONE store is the latest among several South Korean companies that have backpedaled on IPO plans so far this year. In late January, Hyundai Engineering Co., the construction arm of Hyundai Motor Group, withdrew its plan to get its stocks listed on the country's main bourse due to adverse market conditions.

ONE store logged 214 billion won in sales last year and an operating loss of 5.8 billion won. The company racked up 1.13 trillion won worth of transactions on its platform last year.

Its market share in the local mobile app market stands at some 14 percent, with Google Play's presence coming in at 71.9 percent.

The potential listing of SK On has drawn attention since the battery unit was spun off from SK Innovation in October last year, as part of SK's push to bolster the battery business amid growing demand from global automakers vying for a bigger share in the electric vehicle market.

""What's the most important for an IPO to take place is that we need to have our battery business recognized in the market,"" Kim Jun, CEO and vice chairman of SK Innovation Co., told reporters after a general shareholders meeting.

""I expect that we should be able to deliver the performance, in terms of sales, profitability and stable management of equipment, after 2025, and I believe it would be after 2025 if we were to do an IPO,"" he said.

Its bigger rival, LG Energy Solution Ltd., set a record IPO in January that made the battery maker the second-largest company in South Korea by market cap, reflecting the global electrification trend.

Kim said SK On is at the pre-IPO stage to raise funds from investors in advance of going public.

""We need large-scale resources as we are continuing with the facility expansion ... We plan to sign the contracts (on the investments) in the first half,"" Kim said.

Industry sources predict SK On is seeking to raise between 3 and 5 trillion won (US$2.47-4.12 billion), which amounts to about a 10 percent stake in the company.

Kim forecast SK On will swing to the black in the fourth quarter of this year and achieve an annual surplus from next year. SK Innovation's battery business logged an operating loss of 683.1 billion won in the fourth quarter of last year.

In light of any possible advance into new businesses, Kim said he is looking at areas of ""non-carbon, or low-carbon energy sources,"" and discussing various ideas with SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, without elaborating further.

Earlier this month, Chey hinted at ""drawing up a new business map that incorporates energy and environment"" during a visit to a SK Innovation factory in a southwestern city.

"SEOUL– The amount of money South Korean firms raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) more than quadrupled to hit a record high last year thanks to ample liquidity and the overall bullish stock market sentiment, data showed Monday.

A total of 89 companies went public in 2021 by listing stocks on the benchmark KOSPI and secondary tech-heavy KOSDAQ markets and raised a combined 19.7 trillion won (US$16.4 billion), according to the data from the Financial Supervisory Service.

The money raised from IPOs represented a 333.9 percent surge from 4.5 trillion won a year earlier, the data showed. The number of companies whose shares listed on the stock markets for the first time also jumped from the previous year’s 70.

The IPO market was driven by the overall rise in local stock markets and ample liquidity injected into the economy bolstered by low borrowing costs in line with record low policy rates intended to boost the pandemic-hit economy.

Investors got more interested in new stock listings, with the competition ratio for IPO stocks jumping to an average of 1,136 to 1 last year, up from the 956-to-1 ratio a year earlier.

The prices of newly listed stocks closed 57.4 percent higher on average on their first trading day, compared with their IPO prices. The return marked the highest in five years, the data showed.

Their average prices also jumped 54.8 percent at the end of last year from the IPO prices. But of the companies that went private, 28 firms, or 31.5 percent, saw their stocks fall below the IPO prices at the end of last year, the data showed.

"ABUJA - State-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corp will be ready to launch an initial public offering (IPO) in the middle of next year, its group CEO said on Tuesday after the firm formally became a commercial company known as NNPC Ltd.

""We are convinced that by the middle of next year, this company will be IPO ready, which means that you have the system, processes, and a company that is accountable to its stakeholders and shareholders,"" Mele Kyari told reporters in Abuja.

As a commercial entity, NNPC Ltd will no longer have recourse to state funds. Its shares and assets, including oil blocs and refineries are now held by the ministries of petroleum and finance.

NNPC Ltd operates joint production ventures with Western oil majors but anti-corruption campaigners have long asked for the company to be more transparent, calling for the publication of its crude contracts and a statement of accounts.

Junior petroleum minister Timpire Sylva said earlier on Tuesday that NNPC Ltd will operate as a profitable entity that would declare dividends.

"SINGAPORE: QSR Brands, the Malaysian operator of KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in Southeast Asia, has again delayed its domestic initial public offering (IPO) of up to US$500 million (RM2.2 billion) on worries that poor macroeconomic conditions could hurt its valuation, four sources told Reuters.

QSR (M) Holdings Bhd, which holds the sole right from Yum! Brands Inc to run the fast food chains in Brunei, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore, is now looking to launch its IPO next year, the sources, who were aware of the matter, said.

The company, backed by private equity firm CVC Capital Partners and Malaysian state investment firm Johor Corp, was seeking to raise US$400 million-US$500 million by end-2022, the sources said.

“Increasing shareholder value is a key objective and we are always looking for the right opportunity,” a QSR representative said in an emailed response to Reuters today, without referring to the company’s IPO plans. Johor Corp and CVC did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

The sources did not want to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

If successful, the fundraising would have been Malaysia's largest IPO since South Korea's Lotte Chemical Titan Holdings Bhd raised US$878 million in 2017.

QSR was aiming for a market valuation of at least RM6 billion, two of the sources said.

A sharp rise in interest rates coupled with worries of slower economic growth have battered investors' appetite for new stock issuance globally.

QSR has made multiple attempts to list since 2017. It last shelved its IPO plan in 2019 due to choppy local markets and political uncertainty.

Fundraising from Southeast Asian IPOs has halved to US$3.5 billion from January to mid-July 2022 compared with a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data.

The amount raised from Malaysian IPOs has, however, risen 37% to US$570 million, with the number of IPOs increasing to 21 from 17.

"CSIR-CECRI partners with GODI India to set up lithium-ion cells production facility in Chennai GODI India is the first Indian company to manufacture Made-in-India & Made-for-India Lithium-ion cells, which is certified by BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards), tested and qualified by TUV, the third-party testing agency. With this, GODI India can manufacture and sell the cells at par to the standard cells available in the world market,” Mahesh Godi, Founder and CEO, GODI India, said. See More Details

Lithium ion as a battery technology virtually dominates the entire EV market and may remain popular for the foreseeable future. However, technologies like Sodium ion and supercapacitors are set to be adopted as new energy storage solutions in the emerging EV and energy storage sectors. Betting on this likely scenario, Godi India has lined up USD 3 billion investment plan to be executed over the next 5 years.While the 4-year-old startup has started its innings with Lithium-ion technology, its founder and CEO, Mahesh Godi is betting on non-Lithium ion technologies also. He expects such technologies to have a 30% share among electric energy storage solutions by 2027 if the issue of bulk manufacturing of materials for Sodium-ion technology gets sorted out soon.“Maybe next year it will be 5%-10%, followed by 10% to 15%. Incrementally it will go up,” Godi told ETAuto. He expects “a lot of players” to enter the sodium ion market in 2025-26. The R&D and engineering team of 70 members at Godi India is “already working at the level of the materials” and doing applied research with their own material technology.The availability of raw material for sodium ion technology within the country can enable players to make a truly indigenous battery. What engineers will have to figure out is to reduce or offset the energy density of the technology compared to the popular LFP ( Lithium Iron Phosphate ) and NMC ( Nickel Manganese Cobalt ) chemistries of Lithium-ion batteries.It is estimated that while the energy density of a Lithium-ion battery with NMC chemistry is at around 280 watt/hour per KG, and 180 for LFP, for Sodium-ion it’s at around 120. Therefore it is seen as a “much cheaper” and “really good candidate” for stationary energy storage applications in offices and homes where space is not a constraint.There could be EV applications too for the technology. If things move as planned, Godi says the first batch of sodium ion cells will be locally manufactured before December this year.Godi, a former Silicon Valley and Wall Street professional, see Supercapacitors as the other emerging energy storage solution. His company is investing to the tune of USD 40 million in the development and manufacturing of supercapacitors. An announcement with more details is expected next month.While these new plans shape up, Lithium-ion technology is attracting business and investment interest for Godi India, which received its BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) certification for its 21700 cylindrical NMC811 lithium-ion cells that were designed in-house and locally made. TUV was a third-party testing agency. With this, GODI India claims to have become the first Indian company to get this certification for lithium-ion cells in India.On Tuesday, Godi India and CSIR-CECRI (Central Electrochemical Research Institute) announced a ‘first time in India’ public-private partnership to operate and maintain advanced Lithium-ion cell manufacturing. The facility, based in Taramani, Chennai, was inaugurated by Shekhar C Mande, Former Secretary, DSIR (Deptt. of Scientific and Industrial Research) and Former Director General, CSIR, in the presence of Kalaiselvi, Director, CECRI.With the prospects for energy storage businesses improving with the demand growth in the EV and stationary energy storage sectors, Godi India plans to expand its manufacturing footprint in India beyond Hyderabad and Chennai, to Europe, and North America too.The USD 3 billion investment plan will cover the expansion plans too. The funding for the investment, Godi said, will be met through investments in tranches by private equity players, an IPO planned for 2025, and the revenue generated by the business.Since the announcement of manufacturing Lithium-ion cells locally, the company claims to have received inquiries worth “almost USD 200 million” from the players in the domestic market, and from markets like Europe and North America.The lack of local manufacturing of cells has been a major hurdle in the Indian EV ecosystem. While Godi has made a key move, more players, including Reliance Industries, are set to join the new race. The challenge for startups like Godi India will be to remain ahead in the technology curve and race well.",Date,2022-07-20,"godi india: USD 3 bn investment, IPO planned by this tech startup looking at non-Lithium ion solutions too, Auto News, ET Auto","[GODI India, Chennai GODI, BIS, Bureau of Indian Standards, TUV, GODI India, GODI India, Sodium, EV, Godi India, Sodium, Godi India, LFP ( Lithium Iron Phosphate, LFP, Sodium, Godi India, BIS, Bureau of Indian Standards, TUV, GODI India, Godi India, Central Electrochemical Research Institute, Chennai, Shekhar C Mande, Deptt, Scientific and Industrial Research, EV, Godi India, Chennai, Godi, Reliance Industries, Godi India],[non-Lithium, Auto News, ET Auto]",https://ipo.einnews.com/article/581980509?lcf=OCDoEYEqDerAgfzLAbKEdQ%3D%3D

Kyobo Life Insurance headquarters in Seoul. (Kyobo Life Insurance)South Korea’s Kyobo Life Insurance and its second-largest shareholder -- a consortium led by Affinity Equity Partners -- are blaming each other for its recent failure to carry out an initial public offering. The blame game follows the nation’s sole bourse operator Korea Exchange’s decision on July 8 to reject an initial public offering by Kyobo, without citing a reason. Market watchers, however, cited Kyobo’s yearslong legal dispute with the consortium led by the Hong Kong-based private equity firm behind the KRX’s latest move. “Our IPO plan was canceled because of Affinity’s disruption,” Kyobo said in a statement released Friday. “Affinity must cooperate as two-thirds of our shareholders have agreed with our IPO plan,” it added. As of end-2021, Kyobo CEO Shin Chang-jae and related parties stood as the insurer’s largest shareholder with 36.91 percent, while the consortium led by Affinity held a 9.05 percent stake, making it the second-largest shareholder. Other notable shareholders include Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan with a 7.62 percent stake, the Korea Export-Import Bank with 5.85 percent and a consortium led by local private equity firm IMM PE with 5.23 percent. Affinity refused to back down and released a statement on the same day saying that, “All faults and responsibilities for Kyobo’s IPO failure is with its CEO Shin who has failed to uphold his side of the bargain among shareholders.”At the core of the dispute lies Kyobo and Affinity’s failure to get on the same page about the insurer’s IPO price. Kyobo has expressed its desire to set its IPO price based on the current market conditions, while Affinity has been calling for the price to be set at 409,912 won ($311.41) per share based on the put option agreement signed with the Korean insurer in 2012. The consortium claims that the 2012 put option contract obligates Shin to buy out its shares unless he had succeeded in floating the company by 2015. But no initial public offering has yet to take place. In October 2018, the consortium exercised the option. But Shin refused to buy out the shares, citing the exorbitant price of 409,912 won per share. The International Chamber of Commerce intervened at the group’s request, but the two parties have yet to settle their differences. A tribunal, which has already said the contract itself remains valid, is now asked to rule on how the two should set the price, though the decision is not expected anytime soon.Kyobo Life had been seeking to complete an IPO within the first half of this year to diversify its funding sources to brace for the adoption of a new accounting rule for insurance products here in 2023. Its second IPO application was filed in December.(mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

A couple of taxis using Kakao Mobility’s ride-hailing service Kakao T wait for passengers in front of Seoul station on June 28. (Yonhap)A dispute between Kakao Corp. management and its labor union is growing over the IT giant’s rumored attempt to sell its transportation service subsidiary Kakao Mobility to private equity firm MBK Partners. Kakao’s labor union on Wednesday accused the management of giving up on its mobility business, questioning if the sell-off to the private equity fund can help the business grow.According to the union’s statement, Kakao Corp. said its mobility platform cannot grow anymore under its wing, and that the IT giant has no intention of continuing with the mobility business. It added that Kakao’s management said the sale was necessary for the business to expand. The union sees the sale of Kakao Mobility as an attempt to prevent Kakao founder Kim Beom-su from being asked to appear at the National Assembly’s state audit this year. It said it would resume collecting signatures from Kakao Corp. employees for a petition, which was launched in June when rumors of a sale first began swirling, to oppose the deal. Shortly after the union’s statement was released, Bae Jae-hyun, the company’s chief investment officer, downplayed the sale rumors. He said in an internal notice that the company has never considered an entire sell-off.“What we are considering is changing Kakao’s stake in (Kakao Mobility) to become the second-largest shareholder by selling (a 10-19 percent stake),” he said. This suggests MBK would also buy shares from other owners to become the largest shareholder. Kakao Corp. owns a 57.5 percent stake in Kakao Mobility while a consortium led by US private equity firm TPG holds a 29 percent stake and the Carlyle Group has a 6.2 percent stake.The CIO added that the company is contemplating how Kakao Mobility can grow bigger beyond Kakao Corp.’s boundaries, saying no decisions had been made. The union last month met with the IT giant’s leadership including Kim Sung-su, chairman of the board of directors, to oppose the sale.Kakao Mobility went into turmoil after June 14 when it was reported that MBK Partners -- one of the largest private equity firms in Asia -- was in talks with the IT giant to buy a 40 percent stake in Kakao Mobility, which was valued at 8.5 trillion won ($6.6 billion).   Despite Kakao Corp.’s explanation that nothing was decided at the time, the sudden news sparked outcry from employees, as the company even had picked underwriters in March to go public on the Korea Exchange this year. Kakao’s labor union then began collecting signatures of employees and staged protests to oppose the sale of Kakao Mobility. The union denounced Kakao Corp.’s leadership for reneging on its promise to undergo an initial public offering. Previous IPOs of Kakao subsidiaries have included stock options for employees.Prospects of a stock listing have faded due to weak market conditions and damage to the corporation’s image after Kakao Pay executives dumped shares in the company in December last year. The executives, including Ryu Young-joon, CEO of Kakao Corp.’s mobile payment unit, exercised their stock options to sell company shares only a month after Kakao Pay’s listing, reaping a windfall of almost 90 billion won.“Kakao pulled out the sell-off card just three months after it had vowed to carry out shareholder-friendly policies. Isn’t the company trying to retrieve its investment in a different way as the option of going public is likely blocked?” said the union. A staffer at one of Kakao Corp.’s subsidiaries told The Korea Herald that Kakao Mobility employees have been feeling “uneasy” as the direction of the company is now unclear. “We don’t know too much about what’s going on with the rumored sell-off. We just hope things become clear soon,” said the staffer who requested anonymity. Kakao Corp. is under pressure to resolve things one way or another, as an IPO this year was among the conditions of the minority shareholders’ investments in Kakao Mobility. It is almost certain that there would be penalty clauses for failing to list, such as a requirement to buy back shares at an elevated price or to engage in a joint sale to a third party.But with the stock market in freefall, MBK Partners will be in no hurry to complete the acquisition, according to an analyst at a local private equity firm. “The value of technology stocks has decreased, so I think it is unlikely (for MBK Partners) to buy (Kakao Mobility) at the value of 8.5 trillion won. MBK Partners has no reason to go for that price at the moment,” he said. The analyst noted that MBK Partners will also consider tag-along rights of TPG and the Carlyle Group during negotiations with Kakao Corp. Tag-along rights allow minority shareholders to sell their shares if a majority shareholder is negotiating a stake sale. If MBK Partners were to acquire a 40 percent stake from Kakao Corp. as well as all shares owned by TPG and the Carlyle Group, it would approximately cost 6.4 trillion won. “Such a large deal could put some burden on MBK Partners, so won’t they try to push the price further down?” the analyst said. Since the second half of last year, Kakao Mobility has been under fire for hiking ride-hailing fees and expanding into new business areas to provide designated driver services, quick delivery and parcel delivery. The mobility application operator faced heat from the public as its expanded services drove small merchants and business owners out of work.  An IT industry source told The Korea Herald that the sale of Kakao Mobility could give Kakao Corp. some breathing room. “Kakao’s public image has worsened over the past year and Kakao Mobility was one of the major reasons behind that. So I think Kakao might want to detach itself from the mobility business. If a deal is made, it would give Kakao instant cash,” the source said. After Kakao Mobility began as a spinoff subsidiary from Kakao Corp. in 2017, it quickly became the country’s largest mobility platform service provider. Kakao Mobility has 30 million cumulative users and 10 million monthly active users, as of July.The company recorded annual sales of 546 billion won last year, almost doubling from 2020, and posted operating profits of 12.5 billion won to be in the black for the first time.By Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)

Advertisement for Toss Bank`s savings account(Toss Bank)Saving money is never fun. But when combined with a digital pet that grows alongside the size of your savings, it can be more motivating. South Korea’s three internet-only banks -- KakaoBank, K bank and Toss Bank -- have launched unique products such as Tamagotchi-like savings accounts, mobile joint accounts and digital piggy banks to lure customers attracted to the trends. Toss Bank, launched in October last year, has registered 3.6 million users in just eight months through a slew of unique savings products and digital-friendly services. One of them is a Tamagotchi-like savings account in which a user can see a randomly selected digital pet -- turtle, octopus, colt or ghost -- grow with deposits for six months. The digital pet idea has been met with booming demand, as Toss opened 100,000 new accounts within 72 hours of its launch on June 14. Users can deposit a maximum 1 million won ($773) per month for a total of six months with a yield of 3 percent. “The act of saving money requires time and patience, and we wanted to change that time into a fun experience of raising a cute pet for our users,” Toss Bank CEO Hong Min-take told reporters at a media event in Seoul on Tuesday. Toss Bank also plans to launch a joint mobile account “soon,” Hong added, which will cater to friends and groups seeking to split the bill for their favorite activities. The nation’s No. 1 internet-only bank by users, KakaoBank -- with 19.13 million users -- has rolled out various accounts and services tied to its sister company and top mobile messenger KakaoTalk. In this sense, 11.39 million users had opened one of its joint accounts as of May. KakaoTalk currently has some 45 million monthly active users in a country of about 51 million.Its short-term 26-week savings account, a rare product here, was met with high demand upon its launch on June 21, registering 150,000 new accounts within 72 hours. The bank’s piggy bank services are also a key product, allowing users to make deposits of less than 1,000 won on its mobile account daily. The bank managed some 4.35 million piggy bank accounts as of the end of April. K bank is somewhat behind its two rivals in providing unique services, but it is the only mobile bank here providing a real-name account for cryptocurrency trading. Its partnership with local crypto exchange Upbit, signed in June 2020, has helped more than triple its users from 2.19 million in 2020 to some 7 million as of end-2021. K bank’s initial public offering plans, which have been stalled for years, have been gaining pace with the firm filing for a preliminary review for listing on the Korean market with the Korea Exchange on Thursday. Its IPO is predicted to be valued at at least 6 trillion won and the firm is forecast to debut in November, according to market watchers. Korea’s internet-only banks have been expanding quickly in recent years, backed by an increase in the use of smartphones and keeping traditional lenders on their toes with user-friendly services. KakaoBank’s earnings jumped about 80 percent on-year in 2021, with net income amounting to 204.12 billion won, according to a regulatory filing. Operating profit more than doubled over the cited period to 256.94 billion won, and sales also expanded 32.4 percent on-year to 1.06 trillion won.K bank recorded a net profit of 22.4 billion won last year, swinging into the black from a net loss of 105.4 billion won the previous year. Toss Bank, being relatively new to the market, has yet to release its earnings. Its total loans stood at some 4 trillion won as of last month, with 36 percent being taken out by low- and mid-rated customers.(mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

(Kakao Pay)Kakao Pay employees who own shares in their own company each lost an average 20 million won ($15,600) due to the mobile payment firm’s stock price plunge since January, reports said Sunday. The company’s employee stock ownership association purchased a total 3.4 million shares in Kakao Pay at the price of 90,000 won per share prior to its initial public offering on Nov. 3 last year, according to a regulatory filing. Documents show that some 800 employees received an average 4,005 shares each, valued at 360.4 million won at the time of the firm’s market debut. It had set the IPO price at 90,000 won per share, opened at the price of 180,000 won and closed higher at 193,000 won on its first day.But Kakao Pay employees have each lost some 20 million won after the company’s share price plunged over a slew of risks since January, the reports said. The mobile payment operator hit a 52-week-low in terms of closing price on Friday with 85,100, closing 3.73 percent lower from the previous session.Kakao Pay shares lost its rally after it was found in January that former CEO Ryu Young-joon and seven other executives offloaded 90 billion won of company shares by exercising stock option in December, only a month after the company went public. Furthermore, the firm’s second-largest shareholder Alipay dumped 5 million shares -- about 10 percent of the total stake it holds in Kakao Pay -- in a block deal, sending the payment platform operator’s price down 15.57 percent from the previous closing to 89,500 won on Wednesday. Alipay remains the second-largest shareholder, with a 34.72 percent stake in the Korean firm. Members of Kakao Pay’s employee stock ownership association are legally obligated to keep their shares until Nov. 3 this year, a year since the firm’s IPO launch. (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

Graphs showing the change in stock price for Kakao, Kakao Pay and KakaoBank (The Korea Herald)Kakao Pay shares tumbled Wednesday morning after it was reported that its second-largest shareholder Alipay was looking to sell 5 million shares -- about 10 percent of the total stake it holds in Kakao Pay -- in a block deal. The stock price of Kakao Pay fell 15.57 percent to close at 89,500 won. Despite the sell-off, the payment arm of IT giant Kakao said Alipay will continue to be a strategic investor and remain the second-largest shareholder, with 34.72 percent of Kakao Pay shares, and the two sides will carry on with their strong partnership. Experts, however, said this could be the beginning of an ugly turn of events. An analyst at a local securities firm told The Korea Herald that the risk of overhang remains with Alipay’s block deal. “Alipay holds a lot more Kakao Pay shares, so it could sell some of the remaining amount or more. This possibility of dumping off shares has a negative impact for other shareholders as it was seen in today’s price drop,” the analyst said. Park Sang-hyun, an insight provider at independent investment research network Smartkarma, pointed out that Alipay’s return on its Kakao Pay investment is 10 times, so it may be natural to realize a profit to some extent. “But the local market believes that the strategic partnership is cracking, starting with this stake sale. It is highly likely that Alipay will go through a multiphased stake sale process,” Park added. The sharp drop in Kakao Pay’s stock price marked the latest hiccup in a series of disappointments for Kakao Group in the past nine months.In June 2021, Kakao Group became South Korea’s fifth-largest business group in terms of market capitalization at 79.3 trillion won ($65.1 billion), behind the country’s traditional conglomerates: Samsung, SK, LG and Hyundai Motor Group. About a month later, Kakao founder Kim Beom-su was ranked as the richest person in the country by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His net worth was estimated at $13.4 billion. The report said Kim was an exemplary case of how a self-made entrepreneur could succeed in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, which has long been dominated by its family-controlled conglomerates.The tech giant, which rose to prominence with its messenger app KakaoTalk, climbed up the ladder through aggressive expansion of businesses. At the end of the first half of 2021, Kakao had over 150 subsidiaries and affiliates in and out of the country. However, the platform behemoth’s heyday did not last long. The company -- once touted for the legendary tale of its self-made entrepreneur founder and the success of technological innovation in the 21st century -- has undergone a series of blunders and setbacks in recent months. In September, Kakao’s people-friendly image first faced criticism over the company’s rapid expansion, said to have driven small merchants out of business. That led to Kakao’s pledge to pull back some of the company’s services in industries such as snacks and flower delivery.To avert public criticism, Kakao vowed to create a fund of 300 billion won to support small firms and the self-employed, but its misfortunes continued.In the same month, the founder’s investment company K Cube Holdings -- the de facto holding company of Kakao -- was accused of having private interests as well as the illegal succession of family members in employment. More allegations piled on, as K Cube Holdings was accused of fabricating regulatory documents.Kim later apologized at a National Assembly state audit, saying the investment company would change to be committed to social responsibilities.A series of megasized initial public offering deals that further raised Kakao’s market profile, ironically, exposed the root cause for its downfall.A mass sale of Kakao Pay shares by executives including Ryu Young-joon, the then-appointee for Kakao’s next co-CEO, struck the company hard in January.Ryu, who was CEO of Kakao’s mobile payment unit Kakao Pay, was found to have exercised his stock option to sell company shares in December, only a month after the company’s listing. Through this, he and several senior executives collected a total profit of almost 90 billion won, with Ryu taking about half of the gains. Kakao saw fierce backlash from the company’s labor union, retail investors and the general public as the executives raked in massive profits at the expense of investors. Combined with the group’s hasty expansion that had hit small businesses last year, the irresponsible money-making decision raised concerns over whether the IT group could maintain accountable corporate governance. Kakao released an apology, vowing to ban CEOs and executives at its subsidiaries from selling company shares within one to two years after being listed on the market through setting up a new control tower. In March, Kim resigned from his chairman post of the board of directors, leaving behind ailing stock prices and loss of trust among investors.   Kakao’s stock price, which hit as high as 169,500 won per share at the close of June 23, 2021, has halved to a little over 80,000 won per share almost a year later. The stock prices of Kakao Pay and KakaoBank have also suffered similar or worse downfalls, losing trillions of won in the process. On top of losing confidence from the market, the IT giant has irked its own crew.Last week, Kakao unveiled its new “metaverse” working system where employees could basically work wherever they want. The seemingly future-oriented scheme, however, was met with internal resistance from employees, as the new system would require being connected online through a voice channel at all times. Kakao workers expressed concerns and discontent on an in-house online community space, saying the new policy was as an attempt to spy on employees. Kakao CEO Namkoong Whon later said in an announcement to staff that being connected to the voice channel would be decided by crew members in different groups or work areas, but did not scrap the plan. Regarding the implementation of a mandatory working time from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., he said the company will reconsider the plan through communication with staff. Without working on mending ties with stakeholders in and out of the company, Kakao instead unveiled its new vision, “Kakao Universe,” on Tuesday, saying it wants to go beyond Korea. The CEO said they will look to reach 5 billion people across the world through open links that connect them based on their interests instead of targeting South Korea’s 50 million domestic users. But if Kakao cannot redeem itself as the people-friendly company it once was with the rise of its dominant messenger app, experts say it will be difficult for the company to win back people’s hearts and bounce back. “I think Kakao’s stock prices are not doing well due to its subsidiaries going public. Naver has only one entity in the bourse, but Kakao’s other firms have been listed and this has cemented Kakao’s image as a firm that conducts (IPOs) to sell shares to make money,” an analyst at a local private equity firm told The Korea Herald. “Kakao’s growth has been done through mergers and acquisitions, as well as some unethical moves such as taking the business of small merchants. Its corporate governance is also seemingly abominable,” he added.By Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)

Corporate logo of Millie’s Library (Millie’s Library)Millie’s Library, one of South Korea’s largest e-book subscription platform, said Sunday that it is set for a market debut by the end of this year.The company filed a preliminary prospectus on Friday stating that it will offer 2 million common shares out of the total 8,234,901 shares. If the initial public offering process goes as planned, it will be the country’s first e-book platform to go public.Its shares are poised to start trading on the Korea Exchange’s secondary Kosdaq. The lead manager of the envisioned IPO is Mirae Asset Securities.The corporate value of Millie’s Library is estimated to be around 300 billion won ($239 million), according to market insiders.With funds raised from the IPO, the company plans to invest in the production of original book content as well as other content.The company’s sales revenue surged on-year by 61 percent to 28.9 billion won last year. However, it posted an operating loss of 34.8 billion won, and has still not turned a profit.Millie’s Library has been seeking to accelerate growth momentum after it was acquired by Genie Music, the music streaming platform under KT, in 2021. Genie Music currently holds 39 percent of the shares of the company.Working with the KT artificial intelligence business unit, the e-book platform plans to create synergy with an AI-based audio platform to produce more content, including audiobooks.Last year, Seo Young-taek, CEO of Millie’s Library, said if the company’s intellectual property-based business model is well received, its value will exceed the 500 billion won of Radish, the US webtoon platform acquired by Kakao Entertainment. In the long term, the company looks to achieve more than 1 trillion won in value, Seo added.But concerns loom over the e-book platform’s debut amid a lackluster IPO market and an ongoing slump in platform giants such as Naver and Kakao, industry sources said. Naver’s stock price has traded below 300,000 won since late April, while Kakao is also showing sluggish movement between 80,000 and 90,000 won in the citied period.“The company has grown exponentially to become the country’s largest online library platform in just six years. Based on our vision -- ‘become friends with an unlimited number of books’ -- we will expand the presence in the book content market,” Seo said in a statement. Launched in 2017, Millie’s Library services 110,000 e-books through 1,400 publishers as of May. The company is the first here to provide an e-book subscription service. It produces audiobooks, “chat books,” which are books re-created in a chatting format, and audio dramas.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

Hyundai Card headquarters in Seoul (Hyundai Card)Taiwanese banking giant Fubon Financial on Friday raised its stake in South Korea’s Hyundai Card to nearly 20 percent, expanding its clout over management of the card issuer. Fubon Financial is now the card issuer’s third-largest shareholder with 19.98 percent after Hyundai Motor with 36.96 percent and Hyundai Commercial with 28.56 percent. Kia Corp. is the fourth-largest stakeholder with 11.48 percent. The latest announcement puts a final stamp on the exit of a consortium led by Hong Kong-based private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners from the card issuer, which previously owned a 24 percent threshold. Since last year, Affinity had sold its some 20 percent stake to Fubon Financial’s commercial banking unit Fubon Bank and life insurer Fubon Life Insurance for roughly 520 billion won ($409 million). The remaining 4 percent stake was sold to Hyundai Commercial. The move comes four years after the consortium bought the same number of shares for 380 billion won. It also effectively nullifies the Affinity’s initial request made in 2017 for Hyundai Card to complete its initial public offering within four years of the stake purchase, indefinitely delaying the possible listing. “There are no immediate plans for an IPO,” Hyundai Card said in a statement in the day. Early this year, Hyundai Card’s two outside directors from Affinity left their posts to be replaced by Douglas Tsai, management associate at Fubon Financial Holding. The company is expected to fill the vacant post with another Fubon official. “Fubon Financial has highly regarded Hyundai Card’s potential to further grow as a private label credit card issuer alongside our data science and branding skills as our strategic investor,” the card issuer said in a statement. A private label credit card is a credit card that offers more benefits for use at a specific brand‘s stores. Fubon Financial was founded in 1961 with multiple subsidiaries including Fubon Life, Taipei Fubon Bank, Fubon Securities, Fubon Asset Management and more. As of the end of 2021, Fubon Financial Holdings had unaudited net assets of $10.51 trillion. At the end of 2015, Fubon Life purchased a 48 percent stake in Hyundai Life Insurance, to rebrand it as Fubon Hyundai Life.Hyundai Card’s net profit in the first three months of this year declined 4 percent on-year to 76.9 billion won, according to regulatory filing.By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

A promotional image of One Store app store (One Store)South Korea’s homegrown mobile app store operator One Store has dropped its plan to go public amid poor stock market conditions, the company said Wednesday.One Store’s decision comes a day after a book building of institutional investors wrapped up, in which the offering price of a common share was below its suggested price band, at between 34,300 won ($26.9) and 41,700 won apiece. The figures have estimated One Store’s equity value at between 910 billion won and 1.1 trillion won. The decision came in contrast with the company officials’ pledge to proceed with the IPO at all costs, as expressed in a press conference Monday. Officials including Chief Executive Officer Lee Jae-hwan touted One Store as a challenger in the app store market globally dominated by Google and Apple. One Store said in a statement the decision is attributable to “heightening macroeconomic uncertainties that sapped investor sentiment in the stock market,” despite “positive feedback on the company fundamentals” by institutional investors.One Store’s announcement marks the sixth of its kind, following companies including its sister company SK Shieldus and corrugated cardboard maker Tailim Paper.One Store’s shareholders include Korean internet giant Naver, US tech giant Microsoft and Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, in addition to SK Square.Accordingly, its parent SK Square is pressured to change courses from its plan to enhance corporate value through a soft landing of its subsidiaries on the stock market. SK Shieldus, a security services subsidiary of the investment body, also withdrew its bid to go public on Friday. The decision, combined with One Store’s case, is casting a shadow on SK Square’s plan to list more subsidiaries including e-commerce arm 11st. SK Square’s share price hit yet another all-time low. Its shares fell 3.25 percent Wednesday. The market cap of SK Square nearly halved to 6.3 trillion won from the highest point in late November, as soon as the company was spun off from Korea’s largest mobile carrier SK Telecom.

President Yoon Suk-yeol at the National Assembly. (Yonhap)The Yoon Suk-yeol government is looking to make it easier for “vulnerable groups” to take out loans to follow through on his campaign promise, while offering better protection to consumers from predatory lending and unfair corporate practices.The groups refer to self-employed people, small business owners, first-time home buyers and those fresh out of college who the government says need more financial support than all the others. COVID fallout and runaway housing prices have put them in greater focus.“We have yet to receive a clear directive on details but given what’s been said so far, we expect expanding support for the financially challenged groups,” an official at the Financial Services Commission said.The official was referring to Yoon’s “Target 110,” an agenda laying out 110 goals Yoon has given priority. Yoon’s office revealed it last week ahead of Yoon’s swearing in on Tuesday.Financial authorities are preparing concrete steps, such as offering more favorable interest rates, rolling over maturing loans and reducing debts for the self-employed and small businesses to help them recoup losses caused by COVID-19.For first-time home buyers and those seeking to open and expand their savings account from their first job, the government is considering partially easing a long set of mortgage rules and allowing more favorable terms on the savings accounts.Meanwhile, the Yoon government is expected to put a greater check on banks seeking to inflate interest rates -- a complaint consumers have long filed with authorities.Financial services companies would also face a higher burden of proof for any security breaches that violate consumers’ interests, according to authorities. Banks have long been accused of shifting the burden of proof to consumers or regulators to reduce damages to pay.Authorities added that they will deal with unfair corporate practices, referring to a contentious spinoff LG Chem carried out and the stock options row at Kakao Pay, which all took place in January this year.Individual investors holding shares in LG Chem, which wholly owned LG Energy Solution before the world’s second-largest battery maker went public in what was Korea’s record listing, cried foul over the lack of regulation for what they saw as a corporate practice that unfairly diluted their share value. A similar spinoff also took place to float Kakao Pay, a payment arm of Korea’s leading chat app operator Kakao Corp., which is one of the two internet giants along with Naver.But it was a stock price fall that brought down the CEO at Kakao Pay, where the senior management including the CEO exercised stock options a month after the initial public offering, causing what investors called an “unwarranted dip” in stock prices. The bourse operator have had to roll out rules to oversee spinoff IPOs done by large-cap companies and lockup periods on executives looking to offload shares following an IPO, when shares could potentially run higher than expected on investor optimism. Such rule change is one of many to come to level the playing field for consumers, authorities said.By Choi Si-young (siyoungchoi@heraldcorp.com)

One Store CEO Lee Jae-hwan delivers a presentation at a press conference in Seoul, Monday. (One Store)South Korea’s homegrown app marketplace One Store aims to challenge Google and Apple, two US tech giants that enjoy a near-monopoly in the whopping 300 trillion won ($235 billion) app store market globally, with its forthcoming stock market debut here. One Store, the nation’s sole operator of an app store of the same name, is a merged entity of the nation’s four app stores that was previously operated separately by SK Telecom, KT, LG Uplus and Naver. Now it is an affiliate of SK Square, SK Group’s investment unit.In its push for global expansion, it plans to secure a footing first in Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan by the end of this year, and then Europe and North America in the long run. “Korea is the only app store market in the world which made its way out of an app store monopoly,” One Store Chief Executive Officer Lee Jae-hwan told a news conference in Seoul Monday. “To the global market, One Store is close to being among the only options, given the time and cost it takes for a country to create a new app store from scratch.”Lee cited an estimate by IGAWorks Mobile Index that showed One Store beat Apple with 13.8 percent of market share in 2021 and trailed just behind Google. The company also estimated the total transactions on its marketplace at 1.13 trillion won through 2021, exceeding the 1 trillion won per year mark for the first time. Moreover, One Store will benefit from the world’s efforts to break the app store monopoly and its own localization efforts. There are bills pending designed to curtail tech giants’ monopolistic behavior, such as the Open App Markets Act in the United States and the Digital Market Act in the European Union. These bills are expected to open up a new opportunity to the Korean marketplace, dedicated to mobile gaming apps, media content like webtoons and gaming gear, Lee said.Also, One Store charges customers lower commission fees for users compared with Google and Apple at home. The same policy will be applied to the overseas market, according to Lee. Moreover, One Store will support a wider range of payment options including vouchers, bank-to-bank transfers and prepaid cards. “We are seeing a strong pressure worldwide to open the doors to new app store operators, and we expect the entry barrier to disappear by late this year or early next year,” Lee said. Part of the cost for its overseas expansion will come from its initial public offering later this month, which could fetch up to 277.7 billion won. Immediately after the IPO, its market cap is expected to stand at up to 1.1 trillion won. This comes despite the unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and investors’ resulting flight to safety that have weighed down on the stock market. Its sister company SK Shieldus, a cybersecurity service company, withdrew from its bid to offer shares to the public on Friday. The company cited “jittery” market sentiment as its book building drew lackluster attention from institutional investors, reeling from macroeconomic concerns such as Russia‘s invasion of Ukraine and the US interest rate hike to fight inflation.Both SK Shieldus and One Store are controlled by SK Square, a carveout of Korea’s largest mobile carrier SK Telecom. SK Square’s share price hit an all-time low as it fell 5.3 percent on Monday. A One Store official said the company will go on to proceed with the IPO at all costs, considering the low IPO price at nearly the purchase price set in a $15 million equity investment by Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, a joint investment body by Microsoft and Deutsche Telekom.“We think it is the right timing to do the IPO. If we don’t we are losing the opportunity to grow our global presence,” One Store Chief Financial Officer Kim Sang-don said. One Store has never been in the black since it was founded in 2016. The company in 2021 recorded a 5.8 billion won operating loss, up over fivefold in a year. Kim anticipated a turnaround in 2022 with some 5 billion won operating profit.(consnow@heraldcorp.com)

US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference in Washington on May 4. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised the benchmark lending rate by a half percentage point in its ongoing effort to contain the highest inflation in four decades. (AFP)The US Federal Reserve’s biggest rate hike in 22 years poses a dilemma for South Korea’s central bank in adjusting the pace of its monetary tightening and for local businesses seeking to go public, experts said Friday.The Fed’s decision to raise its base rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday (Eastern Standard Time) that set its target federal funds rate to a range between 0.75 percent and 1 percent has presented new hurdles for the Bank of Korea, which is wary of the growing risks tied to capital outflow and a strong dollar trend. In the past, a higher base interest rate in the US has led to a weakening of the Korean won and capital outflow. Recently-appointed BOK Gov. Rhee Chang-yong expressed concerns last month that the higher US base rate could result in higher inflationary pressure here due to the won’s weakening. JP Morgan said in its Wednesday note that it noted a more hawkish-than-expected tone in the BOK’s April monetary policy meeting minutes, indicating the central bank is considering adopting a faster-than-expected monetary tightening timeline. “The minutes bolstered the risk case of a higher terminal rate than our previous expectation of 2.25 percent that we highlighted in our previous note,” the note said. The global banking group now forecast the BOK’s base rate to be raised to 2.5 percent by the end of the year. However, the BOK is also trying to hit the brakes on snowballing household debt, and a higher benchmark interest rate would lead to a heavier burden on debt repayment for households. “The BOK could take a ‘big step’ in May and July under the scenario of healthy exports and consumer spending, but it’s not that easy for them at the moment,” Joo Won, a senior economist at the Hyundai Research Institute said.“The household debt, which has increased to 1.862 quadrillion won ($1.46 trillion) as of end-2021, and risks that lead to an economic recession poses as major hurdles,” he added. The BOK’s benchmark interest rate currently stands at 1.5 percent after its policy board voted to a quarter percentage point rate hike last month. It marked the central bank’s fourth pandemic-era rate hike, after it ended more than a year of a record-low interest rate in August last year. The BOK’s next monetary policy board meeting is scheduled for May 26.Alongside the BOK, the Korean stock market was hit by the Fed’s latest move. SK shieldus, the cybersecurity arm of South Korean telecom giant SK Telecom, reportedly scrapped its plans for an initial public offering amid increased market volatilities due to the Fed’s “big step” rate hike. The firm received a lukewarm response from domestic and foreign institutional investors during a two-day demand forecasting session held Tuesday and Wednesday, dampening its original plan to raise up to 3.55 trillion won through its IPO initially scheduled for May 19. While volatilities are likely to continue, some analysts say that the local market has already absorbed the risks stemming from the Fed’s monetary tightening, painting a rosier-than-expected picture. “The market has preemptively absorbed the risks stemming from the US Fed’s hawkish moves, and the assessment of our stocks have fallen to the level during the 2008 financial crisis,” Samsung Securities analyst Jeong Myung-ji said.“Excluding stocks that are more vulnerable towards interest rates, the effects of the US Fed’s rate hikes on the Korean stock market are likely to be weak,” Jeong added.Korea’s benchmark Kospi closed 1.23 percent lower from the previous session at 2,644.51 on Friday, with foreigners offloading 357.9 billion won.By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

The corporate logo of SK Shieldus (SK Shieldus)SK Shieldus, the South Korean security service subsidiary of SK Group’s ICT arm SK Square, said on Friday that it has scrapped its plans for market debut, citing dampened investor sentiment.“We have submitted a delisting notice to the Financial Supervisory Service because the recent demand forecasting, which decides initial public offering prices, showed that our corporate value may not be well received,” the company said.Stressing that market sentiment has turned sour following global economic uncertainties, the company added it will restart the IPO process when market conditions improve.But Industry insiders say the sluggish demand for SK Shieldus’ IPO comes as the company’s corporate value is said to be overrated. The company was aiming to attract up to 3.55 trillion won ($2.79 billion) through the IPO, which was slated for May 19.In the course of calculating its IPO price, the company compared average stock prices of local security service providers like S-1 Corp., Taiwan Secom Co., AhnLab and Cyberone.However, AhnLab, the IT security firm founded by Ahn Cheol-soo -- the leader of the transition committee for President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol -- had seen an unusual spike in its stock price during March. Before logging a record high of 218,500 won, the stock price has averaged around only 70,000 won. If AhnLab had been eliminated from the calculation, the IPO price of SK Shieldus couldn’t have been that high, sources said.“Although SK Shieldus lags behind S-1, a bellwether security firm, in both sales revenue and profit, the company had sought to raise even higher market cap than the rival,” said Choi Nam-gon, researcher at Yuanta Securities, in a report.Choi added that of the 27.1 million shares the company aims to float, almost half of them will go to Blue Security Investment -- a special purpose company of Macquarie Finance Korea and the second largest shareholder -- since it is selling some of the existing shares to the public in order to cash them.Sources say SK Shieldus’ sudden withdrawal of IPO may have a negative impact on the market debut of SK Square’s other affiliate, One Store. The mobile app marketplace operator plans to go public later this year.Meanwhile, SK Shieldus became the first SK Group affiliate to have failed in making mega-sized deals like those made by SK Biopharmaceuticals, SK Bioscience, SK IE Technology Co. and SK REIT.SK Shieldus, formerly known as ADT Caps, changed its name in October last year, seeking to transform into a comprehensive life care platform. The company currently provides services on cybersecurity, convergence security, physical security, and safety and care in both real world and virtual communities. Last November, the company was spun off from Korea’s largest telecom carrier SK Telecom.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

SK Shieldus CEO Park Jin-hyo speaks at a virtual press conference in Seoul on Tuesday. (SK Shieldus)South Korean cybersecurity service provider SK shieldus Co. withdrew its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) Friday, citing lackluster investor confidence.SK shieldus, the cybersecurity arm of South Korean telecom giant SK Telecom Co., said it had submitted a delisting notice to the Financial Supervisory Service the same day, about a month after reporting an IPO plan in late March.The decision came as the company received lackluster response from domestic and foreign institutional investors during a two-day demand forecasting session Tuesday through Wednesday amid growing uncertainty over the global economy.""SK shieldus decided to shelve its listing, as demand forecasting for the final IPO price showed its corporate value may not be assessed in a proper way,"" the company said in a statement.After factoring in market conditions down the road, SK shieldus will again push for an IPO at an appropriate time when the company is capable of receiving proper assessment from investors, it added.SK shieldus had sought to raise up to 3.55 trillion won ($2.79 billion) through the IPO originally slated for May 19, in what could have been the biggest ever market debut by a local security service provider.SK shieldus, which changed its name from ADT Caps Co. last October, currently provides security services across four main categories -- cybersecurity, convergence security, physical security, and safety and care.Last year, the company chalked off 1.55 trillion won in sales, trailing its rival S-1 Corp. under South Korea's top conglomerate Samsung Group, whose top line came to 2.31 trillion won.SK shieldus is the fourth South Korean company that has backpedaled on IPO plans so far this year. In late January, Hyundai Engineering Co., the construction arm of Hyundai Motor Group, withdrew its plan to get its stocks listed on the country's main bourse due to adverse market conditions.In mid-March, Voronoi Inc., which manufactures kinase inhibitor and other new drugs, terminated its plan to list its shares on the country's tech-laden minor stock market amid sluggish investor interest, with renewable energy firm Daemyoung Energy Inc. recently following suit for the same reason.

"AT FIRST glance, Vodafone has nothing to complain about. On September 8th it sold for $6.6 billion the 3.2% stake in China Mobile that it had bought for $3.3 billion between 2000 and 2002. Such a handsome profit ought to be a cue to crack open the champagne and roast some Beijing duck. Yet the British mobile-phone giant did not get what it really wanted: a way into China. In other countries, Vodafone has had a knack of turning a small investment into a controlling stake, but not in the Middle Kingdom. And it is not alone.

Since the late 1990s, several large state-owned Chinese companies have listed their shares. These initial public offerings typically included “cornerstone” investments by big Western firms. For example, BP, Exxon and Shell (three oil firms) and ABB (a Swiss-Swedish conglomerate) took strategic stakes in PetroChina and Sinopec (two big Chinese oil companies). Alcoa, an American aluminium company, invested in Chalco, a Chinese one. And Western banks bought chunks of the leading Chinese state banks when they were listed.

Foreign firms brought several things to the table: capital, technology, management skills and the prospect of better corporate governance. The Chinese press often referred to them as “elder brothers”. In return, these Western firms wanted access to China's huge domestic market.

It did not work out that way. The Chinese state-owned firms did not need capital so badly that they were prepared to cede control to foreigners. Some also found that the Westerners had less to teach them than they had hoped. “Fly-in” expat managers were often unfamiliar with China, says David Michael, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group. Chinese firms tended to learn more from multinationals that had taken the trouble to build their own large sales forces in China, he says.

Chinese firms no longer feel like little brothers. China Mobile now has a market value half as large again as Vodafone's. PetroChina is much bigger than BP. Both Chinese firms are now rich enough to buy whatever expertise they want.

Western energy companies were quick to notice this shift. BP, Shell, ABB and Exxon all sold their holdings in state-owned Chinese firms by 2005. Alcoa got out in 2007. Financial firms followed, in whole or part, during the financial crisis. When China's state-owned Agricultural Bank was recently listed, no big Western bank bought a significant stake.

Western firms grumble about their failure to turn their stakes in China Inc into a foothold in the Chinese market, but not too loudly, so that they do not annoy the government. Besides, thanks to a rising stockmarket, most made sacks of money from their investments.

A few have not yet cashed out. Telefónica, a Spanish telecoms firm, owns 8.8% of China Unicom and politely rebuffs bankers who advise it to sell. AT&T has 25% of a telecoms business in the Pudong district of Shanghai. Despite regulatory problems, it provides a nationwide service from Pudong, largely to multinational clients. It is a nice business, but a far cry from the dreams some Westerners once had about China.",Date,2022-07-20 13:57:31.193649,Even harder than it looks,"[Vodafone, China Mobile, Vodafone, BP, Exxon, Shell, ABB, PetroChina, Alcoa, the Boston Consulting Group, China Mobile, Vodafone, PetroChina, Shell, ABB, Exxon, Agricultural Bank, AT&T],[]",http://www.economist.com/node/17046627?story_id=17046627&fsrc=rss
"IPO-planning companies lower corporate value to appeal to investors By Anna J. ParkWhile a number of big-named companies are awaiting their IPOs during the second half of this year, questions remain whether their listing plans will succeed amid the unstable global market conditions. The first half of the year was a period of disappointment for major IPOs. Despite their initial plans to go public earlier this year, most big-name companies' IPO plans had to be canceled, as seen in the cases of Hyundai Engineering, SK Shieldus and One Store, as they failed to convince investors of their desired corporate value. Putting such setbacks behind, many major companies, such as Hyundai Oilbank, Kurly, SOCAR, CJ Olive Young, K bank and more, are planning to go public during the second half of this year. So far, nearly 50 corporations have submitted their requests for preliminary IPO evaluations to the Korea Exchange (KRX), while a total of 17 companies are currently conducting their book building processes, during which institutional investors' bids are collected. Market experts say that while the global macroeconomic environment still remains unfavorable for listing companies, local IPO market conditions could improve during the second half, as companies wishing to go public are presenting more reasonable corporate value, removing price hype. ""Now we see many cases of companies that had withdrawn from their previous IPO procedures to lower their desired corporate value substantially to proceed IPO plans again,"" Park So-yeon, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities, said. ""Despite the lowered corporate value, these companies seem to put their priority on completing the IPO process this year,"" the analyst added. In addition to many companies offering lower corporate value, the companies are also voluntarily limiting the number of stocks available on listing day, embracing longer lock-up periods. According to a recent report by DB Financial Investment, the proportion of shares available for circulation by recently listed companies has decreased to 30.1 percent this year, from 38.8 percent in 2020 and 33.4 percent in 2021. This decrease means more financial investors of early phases of the firms' initial investment rounds have embraced longer lock-up periods. ""Because of the efforts to reduce the number of available stock on listing day, investment sentiment for IPOs seems to have somewhat recovered by June,"" Yoo Jin-hyung, an analyst at DB Financial Investment, pointed out, adding that subscription competition rates for IPO companies have also been increasing lately. Despite these efforts on the part of IPO-planning companies to appeal more to the market, ongoing geopolitical uncertainties and global concerns over recession have put downward pressure on the local stock market. However, companies that yield solid profits with convincing business models have still succeeded in raising ample capital through going public in the first half of the year. A total of 50 companies went public during the first half of the year; 30 of these, not including SPACs, REITs and KONEX-transferred companies, logged 39.2 percent in profitability as of the end of June, compared to their initial listing prices. Their rate of return is also much better than the main benchmark KOSPI's return of minus 21.66 percent during the same period.    By Anna J.

"  By Lee Kyung-min IT giant Kakao is coming under intense criticism over its plan to sell off over 10 percent of its stake in its mobility affiliate to a private equity fund (PEF), according to industry and firm officials, Monday.

" By Lee Min-hyung  Kyobo Life Insurance has pledged to try again for a long-awaited initial public offering (IPO), after the move was blocked last Friday when the Korea Exchange didn't grant its approval during a preliminary examination.   The exchange operator did not share additional reasons behind the decision, but the ongoing legal dispute between Kyobo and its financial investor ― led by Affinity Equity Partners ― is considered to be the core reason behind the exchange operator's lack of approval.  ""Kyobo makes it clear that we will push ahead with the IPO again after ending the dispute with our shareholders as soon as possible,"" a spokesman at Kyobo said.  Kyobo Chairman Shin Chang-jae Friday attended a meeting of the exchange's listing committee to underscore the need for its timely IPO.  ""About two-thirds of our shareholders are in favor of our listing, and Kyobo is in dire need of the IPO for the firm's sustainable growth and development,"" he told reporters after the meeting.  The Affinity consortium is the Korean insurer's second-largest shareholder, acquiring a 24 percent stake in 2012 for 1.2 trillion won ($921.7 billion). The consortium demanded that the Kyobo chief buy back its shares at 409,000 won apiece by exercising its put option, but the insurer declined to do so, citing excessive pricing.  A put option is a derivative instrument that gives the holder the right to sell an asset, at a specified price, by a specified date to the writer of the put.  Under the put option agreement, Affinity was given the right to withdraw its investment unless Kyobo went public by 2015. After Kyobo delayed its IPO timeline, Affinity ended up exercising the right. Both sides have yet to reach any clear consensus over the valuation of the insurer's pre-IPO stock price.   The case was then brought to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) for arbitration. The authority said that Shin did not have the duty to buy back the shares at the price offered by Affinity, nor did he have to offer any interest payments or compensation to the investor, during the first round of arbitration last September.  The Affinity consortium appealed to the ICC and called for a second arbitration.  Kyobo urged Affinity to stop taking legal measures that block its planned IPO.  ""Affinity should drop any idea of disturbing our IPO plan by engaging in a useless legal battle, and cooperate with Kyobo as its second-largest shareholder,"" the Kyobo spokesperson said.  The Affinity consortium, however, stepped up its criticism of Kyobo, urging Shin to fulfill his responsibility first before carrying on with the IPO.

As K bank has officially kicked off its IPO schedule, with submission of a preliminary evaluation request to the Korea Exchange (KRX) at the end of last month ― the first step for the bank's listing on the KOSPI ― the bank plans to emphasize its comfortable service-oriented banking. It is a different approach from KakaoBank's focus on its IT-based digital platform in its IPO strategy. Rather than stressing the bank's digital platform as a key growth factor, K bank has been highlighting the core competency of its banking services. The bank's partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Upbit is also expected to be emphasized, as a way to differentiate it from KakaoBank in terms of growth potential. However, it is uncertain whether the bank's plan to distance itself from KakaoBank's case would succeed in the market's evaluation of K bank's future growth. Given that it usually takes around four months from requesting a preliminary evaluation to going public, K bank is expected to be listed as early as November.

As Toss is a comprehensive financial platform that not only involves banking services but also brokerage as well as other functions, the company seems to be focusing on attracting further investments for now, at a corporate valuation of about 10 trillion won.It is largely expected that Toss' IPO will come as early as the second half of next year or even later than that. In the meantime, Toss is planning to brand itself as a total financial platform as well as a global fintech firm, differentiating itself from KakaoBank.

"Korea's top fashion unicorn dismisses concerns of bubble in sectorBy Kim Yoo-chulThe COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a huge blow to the fashion industry, causing a lot of traditional merchants to be unsure of how to maintain their bottom lines as consumers shift in droves to e-commerce platforms.Fashion retailers that managed to actively implement e-commerce strategies have benefited significantly from the pandemic. Plus, new and existing fashion e-commerce brands have been hugely successful, while the pandemic ended up gradually widening the gap between digitally-driven apps and platforms and offline laggards.Fashion industry experts have no doubt that the business of fashion is on track to seeing a new order take root, because the pandemic has changed how consumers interact with brands and redesign their shopping experience.From an investor's standpoint, the pandemic has led to the rise of ""unicorn"" fashion e-commerce companies and an increase in their valuations. Startup companies with a billion-dollar valuation are labelled as unicorns as they were once considered as rare creatures.Some industry analysts warned investors to be wary of a bubble forming in the industry that could burst at any time.But a senior executive at the country's top fashion e-commerce platform operator dismissed such concerns.""Because a new order is prevailing in the industry given increased investor focus on sustainability-oriented considerations during and after the pandemic, with particular demand for growth potential, a few rational players will thrive even more,"" Seo Eun-hee, the marketing chief of Musinsa, said in a recent interview with The Korea Times at the fashion e-commerce unicorn's new studio in Seongsu-dong, also known as Seoul's Brooklyn.   By Kim Yoo-chul  The COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a huge blow to the fashion industry, causing a lot of traditional merchants to be unsure of how to maintain their bottom lines as consumers shift in droves to e-commerce platforms.  Fashion retailers that managed to actively implement e-commerce strategies have benefited significantly from the pandemic. Plus, new and existing fashion e-commerce brands have been hugely successful, while the pandemic ended up gradually widening the gap between digitally-driven apps and platforms and offline laggards.  Fashion industry experts have no doubt that the business of fashion is on track to seeing a new order take root, because the pandemic has changed how consumers interact with brands and redesign their shopping experience.  From an investor's standpoint, the pandemic has led to the rise of ""unicorn"" fashion e-commerce companies and an increase in their valuations. Startup companies with a billion-dollar valuation are labelled as unicorns as they were once considered as rare creatures.  Some industry analysts warned investors to be wary of a bubble forming in the industry that could burst at any time.  But a senior executive at the country's top fashion e-commerce platform operator dismissed such concerns.  ""Because a new order is prevailing in the industry given increased investor focus on sustainability-oriented considerations during and after the pandemic, with particular demand for growth potential, a few rational players will thrive even more,"" Seo Eun-hee, the marketing chief of Musinsa, said in a recent interview with The Korea Times at the fashion e-commerce unicorn's new studio in Seongsu-dong, also known as Seoul's Brooklyn.  ""I would say the fashion e-commerce industry is experiencing the 'valley of death.' Because Musinsa is the only unicorn company in the fashion e-commerce industry in Korea that is reporting profits every year since the start of business operations, investors will focus more on potential returns and I'm sure Musinsa's existing and new business models are good enough to appeal to investors,"" Seo said.The ""valley of death"" is a term widely used in the startup industry, referring to the period of negative cash-flow in the early stages of a venture company before their new product or service generates revenues. More than 80 percent of new ventures that fail to win investors' support end up failing within the first three years. That's because large investors prefer to park their money in business models that are proven and ready to scale, rather than R&D and development efforts.Founded in 2012, Musinsa operates an online shopping mall called ""Musinsa store,"" a fashion magazine ""Musinsa magazine,"" and offline store ""Musinsa store."" As of May this year, Musinsa's is valued at around 5 trillion won, up from 2.5 trillion won just a few years ago, according to officials in the local investment banking industry.The country's top fashion e-commerce platform reached 2.3 trillion won worth of monetary transactions by last year, up 90 percent year-on-year. Revenue in 2021 reached 466.7 billion won, up 41 percent year-on-year, while the company reported 54.2 billion won in operating profit, up 19 percent, it said in a statement to The Korea Times. It has over 10 million users and so far, the company has attracted 320 billion won in investments, including 130 billion won from IMM private equity. Its outstanding growth trajectory stems from its offering of a wider selection of foreign casual brands that were quite tough to find in Korea along with limited-edition items. No change in prime targets, phased global expansion strategy Regarding its brand positioning statement, which could lead to market differentiation from competitors, the marketing chief Seo said Musinsa is attempting to rise as a multi-platform that could include fashion- and culture-centric features.

But she said Musinsa is specifically eyeing Japan, countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia for increased market penetration. Key rationale behind its focus on these markets is that K-Pop and Korean entertainment including music, film and TV programs are widely being circulated, a huge plus factor in terms of appealing target consumers with Korean street style clothing inventories.The continued popularity of K-culture is contributing to reshaping consumer behavior in Asia and the popularity of Korean content also means that language is no longer a barrier for consumers watching preferred foreign media content.

""We are reviewing the validity of overseas business expansion plans.

Musinsa earlier scrapped its plan to acquire controlling stakes in its domestic rival, which focuses on Japanese shoppers because the two failed to agree on key conditions regarding the deal. ""We have a subsidiary in Japan. There are influencer groups according to regions and cities.

Based on brand recognition it earned from online sales, it wants to deepen its relationship with customers and personalize customer engagement by opening up physical stores, according to Seo.""We are planning to set up pop-up stores in Jeju, September 1 and as a way to show off healthy relationship with partners, we could be able to manage joint marketing campaigns as a fleamarket style.""

"Blowup of Terra's stablecoin raises credibility concerns for industry, forcing crypto investors to wait longer for price rebound By Kim Yoo-chulThings are changing rapidly in the world of crypto. Very recently, the global cryptocurrency market saw an extension of volatility even to stablecoins, mostly due to the huge collapse of the TerraUSD, a UST or algorithmic stablecoin, and its sister token, Luna ― which should theoretically maintain a 1:1 peg to a currency and commodity. Plus, because inflation remains too much of a force on central banks around the world, pressuring them to move expeditiously to bring the level back down by raising the benchmark rate sharply, more than 40 percent of crypto holders are now underwater in terms of their investments, according to analysts.All of the numbers are just bad. The price of bitcoin, the benchmark cryptocurrency in the industry, has fallen below $21,000, data shown by market tracker investing.com said. This fall is a major break from the $31,000-to-$32,000 price range bitcoin had gotten into since the collapse of Terra's UST back in early May. This year, Bitcoin's prices have been slashed by over 50 percent of its all-time high of around $69,000 back in November 2021. The crypto market's total market capitalization has crashed to under $1 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.Cryptocurrency analysts have no big fears that the growing inflation or elevated uncertainty regarding the economic climate could persist in the market as core dragging factors. Additionally, the belief that crypto assets offer a hedge against inflation is weakening as recent years' price increases have been thanks to excess market liquidity, which also led to the rise of the major tech stocks listed on the Nasdaq. The point is that both technology stocks and cryptocurrencies are exposed to the U.S. Federal Reserve's and other central banks' monetary tightening concerns. Investors are required to have more patience if they want to give their investments the best chance for profit-taking. Lee Sirgoo, one of the influential figures in the global crypto industry, as he is the chief executive at Dunamu, the operator of the country's largest cryptocurrency operator, Upbit, didn't deny that the crypto market is heading towards being more bearish than bullish. Institutional investors, who have kept their crypto assets in ""cold wallets,"" a type of digital wallet that stores cryptocurrency offline, have started unloading their holdings due to the worsening macro-economic conditions.""Normally, big institutional investors don't store their cryptocurrency assets in exchanges, the amount of which is huge but out of circulation, as they use cold wallets. Amid higher crypto demand, this practice led to the increase in cryptocurrency prices. But they want to prepare for the risks associated to the additional fall in cryptocurrencies by reducing their crypto holdings, resulting in more supply and price fall,"" Lee said in a recent interview at its headquarters in Seoul.The CEO viewed that the cryptocurrency industry is facing ""credibility problems"" because risk contagion in the market is closely connected to such external shocks, which could lead to a ""butterfly effect."" But Lee omitted saying that the continued market tumble could also lead the industry itself to face a structural downturn.""When it comes to blockchain technology, making reward systems visible really matters.

Yes, it's still very necessary for blockchain network participants to consider a host of issues including the legal structure and governance model of a blockchain.

But the Terra-Luna crash awakened the need for the industry to have systems in terms of factoring in unpredictability to keep the crypto ecosystem working.""Experts said that the Terra-Luna collapse might prove the catalyst for possible tougher regulation of the industry and may accelerate the new Korean government's efforts to regulate stablecoins.

Before rumors of a sell-off spread, the number of Kakao Mobility's unionized workers stood at only around 70.Their latest decision has been widely interpreted as part of efforts to gain the upper hand in a potential negotiation with the new owner of their company.

"Rare Gelsinger-Lee meeting at Samsung headquarters in Seoul raises expectations beyond today's collaboration By Kim Yoo-chulIntel's chief executive Pat Gelsinger's recent visit to Samsung raised lots of expectations in the global tech world, especially regarding the Korean tech giant's updated stance on mergers and acquisitions (M&As), as the company said recently it's on track to strike ""sizable M&A deals."" Regarding the specifics of Gelsinger's meeting with Samsung leader Lee Jae-yong, Samsung representatives in Seoul said the pair ""discussed how to cooperate between the two companies."" It's unclear if their meeting went beyond the reaffirmation of the two sides' long-standing partnership, or was just aimed at chit-chatting while Gelsinger was in Seoul as part of his Asia tour.But according to sources contacted by The Korea Times, all of whom are familiar with Samsung- and semiconductor-related issues, whatever was discussed is of great interest, for a variety of reasons. The bottom line is that Samsung plans to invest a whopping 450 trillion won with a focus on semiconductors and the bio industry. From the budget announced, Samsung is looking to invest at least 20 percent in business ideas that will help strengthen its core competiveness.Intel has 'structural' problems; Samsung's core businesses challengedReports said given the two companies' moves in searching for partners to jointly acquire stakes in U.K.-based chip designer Arm, Lee and Gelsinger might have touched on the possibility for the two companies to create a consortium of sorts to acquire Arm. The establishment of a consortium made up of Arm's clients would ease concerns regarding any antitrust issues raised by regulators in China, the United States and Europe. Therefore, doing this would make the deal go through quite quickly. Mobile chipset titan Qualcomm confirmed its intention to jointly acquire Arm stakes with partners, while SK hynix is also ready to join a consortium for Arm. But still, SoftBank, Arm's top stakeholder, said it plans to list Arm as soon as possible, and added it aims to maintain a majority stake after an initial public offering (IPO), which may happen within the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.

These two Asian companies are looking good in terms of possessing the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology needed to manufacture premium chips. Intel's technology roadmap announced recently failed to reflect investors' expectations, due to capital challenges raised over an ongoing semiconductor shortage and Intel's huge struggle with its Optane memory business. This calls into question the possibility of payoffs of its announced multi-billion-dollar investment for fabrication lines in the U.S. state of Ohio and other purposes. Samsung is already a leader in Compute Express Link (CXL), although a lot of its memory is designed to operate inside Intel servers.Intel stock problems haven't gone away. Its stocks fell below $40 last week in New York from a 52-week high of $58.42.Eyeing stakes in Intel? The question is can Samsung review the possibility of acquiring stakes in Intel?

No large-scale M&A deals have been made since then.The sources said the estimated cost for the given range of share sizes would vary between 55 trillion won and 65 trillion won. As Samsung's credit rating is good enough, it could hedge against investment risks through financial help from outside investors, if needed. ""It's worth thinking about how Intel would be positioned under the current management because the company is highly likely to shift its business model from that of integrated device manufacturing (IDM)-focused to a hybrid-driven business model with more focus on production outsourcing,"" Kim Sun-woo, an analyst at Meritz Investment in Seoul, said in a recent report.

Bank of America was the key adviser on sizable M&As in the semiconductor industry, including Xilinx's $35 billion sale to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).What to note from that example is that both Samsung and Intel have aggressive plans to expand their position in the lucrative foundry space, but both these companies have yet to win significant bulk orders from major chip design rivals, said analysts. Chip foundries manufacture semiconductors for third parties. ""U.S. President Joe Biden's visit to Samsung's semiconductor factory in Pyeongtaek and Samsung's opening of the current status of chip development using a 3-nanometer-level manufacturing technology illustrate its growing confidence in terms of providing a stable supply of advanced chips when requested.
