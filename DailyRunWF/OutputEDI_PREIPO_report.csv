"Geregu Power Plc (NGX:GEREGU) is a power generation company incorporated in 2006 and commissioned in 2007. The Company is principally engaged in the generation and sale of electric power.
 
Geregu’s power plant is wholly owned and operated by Amperion Power Distribution Company Limited (“APDCL”).
 
On Wednesday, October 5, 222, the company became the first power-generating company in the country to be admitted with the Mainboard of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) by way of listing by introduction with the admittance of 2.5 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each at N100 per share on the Exchange.
 
The listing added N250 billion to the market capitalization of NGX. On its first trading day on the NGX, the Power generating company’s share gained 10% to close at N110 per share from the N100 per share it was listed by introduction.
 
Meanwhile at the close of the last trading on Tuesday, October 11, 2022, it closed at 120.90 and thus has gained 9.91%, ranking it 39th on the NGX in terms of year-to-date performance and the 14th most valuable stock with a market capitalization of N302 billion.
 





 
Why Geregu listed by way of Introduction
Most companies prefer an Initial Public Offer ” IPO” during the listing, where new shares are created, underwritten, and sold to the public. During secondary trading on the NGX, ownership of shares is simply transferred from one investor to another.
 
IPO listing is a bit cumbersome and costly for most companies; hence some companies list their stocks via Listing by Way of Introduction (LBI).

In LBI, the company listing does not have to undergo the book building, underwriting, and public offer process, and no new shares are created; only existing, outstanding shares are sold.
This means Geregu Power Plc listing by introduction entails that only existing shareholders of Geregu in this case, its owners trade their already existing shares with anyone who may be interested in buying a piece of the company.
Amperion Power Distribution Company Limited owns the largest share in Geregu Power Plc.

Companies may opt for listing by the introduction to time the market and avoid or reduce market uncertainties or for other reasons not because they need money immediately.

For example, in 2019, Nigeria’s leading telecommunication company, MTNN listed by introduction on the NGX and prior to going public, had announced earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation of N453.1bn ($1.27bn) for the 2018 financial year.
Also, recall that Geregu Power Plc in July 2022 announced its debut of N40.085 billion senior unsecured bonds under its N100 billion multi-instrument bond issuance in the debt market, which was over-subscribed.
The issuance which started on July 1, 2022, following Security and Exchange Commission’s approval closed on July 14, 2022, with a bond yield of 14.50%

 
Company Performance
The audited financial statements of the power generating company submitted to the regulators show that, in terms of earnings, the company, met the NGX listing requirement of a pre-tax profit from continuing operation of not less than N300million cumulatively for the last three (3) fiscal years and a minimum of N100 million in two (2) of these years.

The company’s last pre-listing financial year (2021) profit before tax stood at N29.512 billion; 43% up from N20.649 billion in 2020, while profit after tax was up 45.49% to N20.550 billion from N14.125 billion in 2020FY and earnings per share jumped to N2,055 per share from N1,412.54 in 2020.
Over the past four years (2018 -2021), the average profit after tax is N18.782 billion or 25% average growth per year, resulting in an impressive average net profit margin of 28% per year.

Bottom Line: Overall, when deciding to invest in shares of Geregu Power Plc, take a similar approach as if you are investing in IPO shares.

"LOS ANGELES, Oct.  12, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP (“GPM”) reminds investors of the upcoming October 17, 2022 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired MINISO Group Holding Limited (“MINISO” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MNSO) securities pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement and prospectus (collectively, the “Registration Statement”) issued in connection with the Company’s October 2020 initial public offering (the “IPO” or “Offering”).  If you suffered a loss on your MINISO investments or would like to inquire about potentially pursuing claims to recover your loss under the federal securities laws, you can submit your contact information at www.glancylaw.com/cases/miniso-group-holding-limited/. You can also contact Charles H. Linehan, of GPM at 310-201-9150, Toll-Free at 888-773-9224, or via email at shareholders@glancylaw.com to learn more about your rights.  On October 15, 2020, MINISO conducted its IPO, issuing approximately 30.4 million American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) at $20.00 per ADS.  On July 26, 2022, Blue Orca Capital published a report alleging, among other things, that MINISO “lies about its core business model” by claiming that 99% of its stores in China are operated by independent franchises. However, an investigation shows that over 620 supposedly independent franchises are registered under the names of MINISO executives or individuals “closely connected” to the Company’s chairman.  On this news, MINISO’s ADS price fell $1.08, or 15%, to close at $6.13 per ADS on July 26, 2022, thereby injuring investors.  The complaint filed in this class action alleges that Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Defendants and other undisclosed related parties owned and controlled a much larger amount of MINISO stores than previously stated; (2) as a result, MINISO concealed its true costs; (3) the Company did not represent its true business model; (4) Defendants, including the Company and its Chairman, engaged in planned unusual and unclear transactions; (5) as a result of at least one of these transactions, the Company is at risk of breaching contracts with PRC authorities; (6) the Company would imminently and drastically drop its franchise fees; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.  Follow us for updates on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook.  If you purchased or otherwise acquired MINISO securities pursuant and/or traceable to the IPO, you may move the Court no later than October 17, 2022 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit. To be a member of the class action you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the class action.

"SINGAPORE, Oct.  12, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --     1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 Taylor Maritime Investments Limited (“TMI”), and Grindrod Shipping Holdings Ltd. (“Grindrod” or the “Company”) are pleased to announce that they have entered into a transaction implementation agreement (the “Implementation Agreement”),dated as of 11 October 2022, among the Company, TMI and Good Falkirk (MI) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TMI (the “Offeror”) providing for a voluntary conditional cash offer (the “Offer”) to be made by the Offeror for all the issued ordinary shares (the “Shares”) in the capital of the Company (other than Shares held by the Offeror and Shares held in treasury) (the “Offer Shares”), in accordance with Rule 15 of The Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers (the “Code”) and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).  1.2 Capitalised terms which are not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 of this Announcement.  2.

NASDAQ  (1) Grindrod Shipping share price quoted on the NASDAQ based on data extracted from Bloomberg L.P. as at the Last Trading Day or Disclosure Date (as appropriate), rounded to the nearest two decimal places.  (2) The percentage figures are rounded to the nearest one decimal place.  JSE   Notes:  (1) Grindrod Shipping share price quoted on the JSE based on data extracted from Bloomberg L.P. as at the Last Trading Day or Disclosure Date (as appropriate), rounded to the nearest two decimal places.  (2) Based on the rate extracted from Bloomberg L.P. as at the Last Trading Day or Disclosure Date (as appropriate), rounded to the nearest two decimal places.  (3) The ZAR price is converted to USD at the rate prevailing on the relevant day or, in the case of the VWAP, the average rate prevailing during the relevant period.  (4) The percentage figures are rounded to the nearest one decimal place.  2.3 Background to and reasons for the Offer  (a) Background to the Offer  The Offeror, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TMI, first acquired shares in the Company in Q4 2021. Through additional purchases in Q4 2021 the Offeror established an approximately 26% ownership position in the Company and designated Paul Charles Over to serve on the Company’s board of directors. On 25 August 2022, TMI delivered to Grindrod a non-binding indicative proposal to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company not already owned by Offeror through the Proposed Transaction.  (b) Rationale for, and benefits of, the acquisition  Strategic shareholder consolidating ownership position through premium, all cash Offer   The aggregate value of $26.00 per Grindrod Share represents (i) a 26.8% premium to the price per Grindrod Share of US$20.50 on 26 August 2022 being the last traded price per Grindrod Share on the NASDAQ on 26 August 2022 and (ii) a 20.2% premium to the 90-day volume weighted average price of US$22.66 per Grindrod Share prior to the Disclosure Date. The Company’s stock average daily trading volume on the NASDAQ of $7.3m during the 90-day period prior to 26 August 2022 represents 1.4% of the Offer’s $506.3m valuation of the Company being traded each day. The Offer is conditional upon, among other conditions, the Minimum Condition, namely the Offeror owning more than 50.0% of the shares carrying voting rights of the Company.  Certainty of a premium, cash exit for Grindrod investors  The Offer in cash provides an immediate and certain exit opportunity for Grindrod Shareholders at an attractive premium to Grindrod’s undisturbed share price at a time of significant market volatility and economic uncertainty.  Strategic combination creates a significant market player in the mid-sized dry-bulk industry with a combined fleet of 582 vessels  TMI believes the Offer will create a significant player and owner of mid-sized dry-bulk ships. Together TMI and Grindrod own a fleet of 58 geared vessels (including 6 chartered-in ships, 4 of which have purchase options), providing freight capacity to a high-quality customer base and moving a diversified portfolio of cargoes around the world.  TMI believes complementary fleets have the potential to generate defensive earnings and sustainable dividends, improving average vessel age and carbon intensity.  Scale and global operations to unlock additional revenue and operational cost savings  TMI believes the combination of TMI and the Company would enable the Enlarged Group’s chartering and technical management functions to realise additional value through the enhanced scale and utilization of the combined fleet and charter book. The combined fleet will mean that the Enlarged Group’s assets are closer to its customers around the world, enabling TMI and Grindrod’s experienced chartering teams to create additional value through positioning advantages, and the technical teams to make economic, bulk purchases of spares. The Enlarged Group is expected by TMI to achieve enhanced realised revenue and cost unit economics that are not available to either TMI or Grindrod on a standalone basis.  Conservative business model and capital structure to deliver liquidity and free cash generation  TMI expects that the Enlarged Group will maintain a conservative long-term capital structure. In order to fund the Offer, TMI has arranged an acquisition facility. At 100% acceptances, TMI will exceptionally increase its debt to gross assets ratio to 40% and is committed to reducing this to no more than 25% within 18 months, with the new facility significantly reduced or eliminated within that timeframe.  TMI intends to continue to implement its strategy of employing its ships primarily on period time-charters, utilizing a mix of duration, including short term Charters (less than 6 months), medium term Charters (more than 6 months) and long-term Charters (greater than a year) which are expected to benefit from staggered renewals of an even larger fleet, with a view to flattening the income curve.  The combined fleet is expected by TMI to generate robust free cash flow, which, together with proceeds from vessel sales, as part of overall fleet renewal strategy, will be used to repay debt.  Resilient and flexible business model  TMI expects the Enlarged Group should benefit from enhanced resilience and improved market access to face potentially more difficult macro environments and in the face of future incoming shipping regulations relating to the environment.  3. TERMS OF THE OFFER  3.1 Terms of the Offer. In accordance with Section 139 of the Securities and Futures Act 2001 of Singapore, the Code, and Regulations 14D and 14E of the SEC promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act (subject to the SEC No-Action Relief),and subject to the terms and conditions to be set out in the formal offer documentation to be issued in respect of the Offer (the “Offer to Purchase”), the Offer will be made on the following basis:  (a) Offer Shares. The Offer will be extended to all the Offer Shares, which shall include all new Shares unconditionally issued or to be issued prior to the final closing date of the Offer pursuant to the valid vesting and settlement of any outstanding awards granted by the Company which are (i) unvested, or (ii) vested but remain unsettled (the “Outstanding Awards”) pursuant to the 2018 Forfeitable Share Plan operated by the Company and its subsidiaries (the “FSP”).  (b) Offer Price. The price shall be US$21.00 in cash for each Offer Share (the “Offer Price”).  (c) No Encumbrances.

Accordingly, if any Distribution is declared, paid or made by the Company in respect of the Offer Shares on or after the Offer Announcement Date to a Grindrod Shareholder, the Offeror reserves the right to deduct from the Offer Price payable to each Grindrod Shareholder who validly tenders their Share or has validly tendered their Shares in accordance with the terms of the Offer, the amount of such Distribution. For the avoidance of doubt, no reduction of the Offer Price is contemplated by this paragraph 3.2 in respect of the declaration or payment of the Special Dividend or any Permitted Dividend.  3.3 Adjustment for alterations to capital. If, any time on or after the Offer Announcement Date and the end of the Subsequent Offering Period, any change in the outstanding Shares occurs as a result of any share split (including a reverse share split), subdivision or combination, any share dividend or share distribution with a record date during such period, the Offeror reserves the right to equitably adjust the Offer Price to reflect such change and provide the holders of each Share the same economic effect as contemplated hereunder prior to such event.  3.4 Jurisdictions. The Offer will be made in accordance with Regulations 14D and 14E of the SEC promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act (subject to the SEC No-Action Relief) and the Code (subject to the SIC Rulings) as a single offer concurrently in the United States of America, South Africa, Singapore and other jurisdictions to which the Offer may be legally extended.  3.5 Offer Conditional.

OUTSTANDING FORFEITABLE SHARE AWARDS  6.1 The Company Group operates the FSP in which certain employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and non-executive directors of the Company participate. Under the rules of the FSP, participating employees and non-executive directors may be granted awards to be settled with a specified number of Shares. As at the Offer Announcement Date, based on information provided by the Company, there are 475,515 Outstanding Awards, pursuant to which 475,515 Shares are issuable.  6.2 Awards Proposal. The Company and the Offeror will make a proposal (the “Awards Proposal”) to the holders of Outstanding Awards (“FSA Holders”) that, subject to the Acceptance Time occurring, each Outstanding Award shall become fully vested at the Acceptance Time by virtue of the Company’s compensation committee resolving to accelerate the vesting thereof. In respect of such Outstanding Awards:  (a) if the consent of the relevant FSA Holder to the cancellation of all his or her Outstanding Awards so vested has been obtained, such FSA Holder shall be entitled, in consideration of such cancellation, to receive payment of US$21.00 (in lieu of the Offer Price) in respect of each Share which would have accrued on the Outstanding Awards held by such FSA Holder, using cash provided by the Offeror (each such payment, an “FSA Payment” and the aggregate of all such FSA Payments, the “Aggregate FSA Payment”);  (b) if the consent of the relevant FSA Holder to the cancellation of all his Outstanding Awards so vested has not been obtained, such FSA Holder shall be entitled to be issued such number of Shares accruing to such Outstanding Awards, with such Shares to be delivered by the Company to such holder as promptly as practicable after the Acceptance Time; and  (c) subject to the occurrence of the Acceptance Time, each FSA Holder shall receive payment of US$5.00 (in lieu of the Special Dividend) (the “Special Dividend Equivalent Payment”) in respect of each Share which would have accrued on the Outstanding Awards held by such FSA Holder as at the Dividend Record Date, using cash provided by the Company.  6.3 Following payment by the Offeror to the Company of an amount equivalent to the Aggregate FSA Payment, the Company will promptly issue to the Offeror, such number of Shares obtained by dividing the Aggregate FSA Payment by the Offer Price.  6.4 Each FSA Payment and Special Dividend Equivalent Payment will be made by the Company no later than the first payroll date immediately following the Acceptance Time, and TMI, the Offeror and the Company shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from each such FSA Payment or Dividend Equivalent Payment, any amounts required to be deducted or withheld under applicable tax laws.  7. INFORMATION ON TMI AND THE OFFEROR  Information on TMI  7.1 TMI is an internally managed shipping company listed on the Premium Segment of the Official List, its shares trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange since May 2021 (the IPO).  TMI specialises in the acquisition and chartering of vessels in the Handysize and Supramax bulk carrier segments of the global shipping sector.  TMI invests in a diversified portfolio of vessels which are primarily second-hand and which, historically, have earned returns in excess of the Company's target dividend yield of 8% p.a. (on the initial issue price).  The current portfolio numbers 27 vessels in the geared dry bulk segment (Handysize and Supramax types).  The ships are employed utilising a variety of employment/charter strategies.  7.2 TMI pursues a progressive dividend policy. It announced an increased interim dividend of 2 cents per Ordinary Share paid on a quarterly basis on 28 July 2022, with a targeted total NAV return of 10-12% per annum over the medium to long-term. The Board of TMI declared a special dividend of 3.22 cents per share in respect of the period from IPO to 31 March 2022 paid on 6 May 2022, which brought total dividends declared for the period from IPO to 31 March 2022 to 8.47 US cents per share, representing a dividend yield on the IPO price of approximately 10% on an annualised basis.  7.3 TMI has the benefit of an experienced Executive Team led by Edward Buttery and who previously worked closely together at the Commercial Manager, Taylor Maritime.  Established in 2014, Taylor Maritime is a privately owned ship-owning and management business with a seasoned team that includes the founders of dry bulk shipping company Pacific Basin Shipping (listed in Hong Kong 2343.HK) and gas shipping company BW Epic Kosan (formerly Epic Shipping) (listed in Oslo BWEK:NO).  Taylor Maritime's team of industry professionals are based in Guernsey, Singapore and London.  7.4 TMI believes the Proposed Transaction represents an exciting opportunity to combine Grindrod's operations with TMI to create a significant owner of Handysize up to Ultramax dry cargo ships.  TMI believes the complementary nature of the respective companies' fleets and enhanced operational scale in the geared dry-bulk sector should create meaningful additional value for TMI Shareholders and customers that each of the companies serve. Further details of the benefits of the Transaction are set out below under “Rationale for, and benefits of, the acquisition”.  Information on the Offeror  The Offeror is wholly-owned subsidiary of TMI which is incorporated in the Marshall Islands and whose principal business is to hold investments on behalf of the TMI group. The Offeror currently holds the TMI group’s existing investment in Grindrod.  8. INFORMATION ON GRINDROD  8.1 General corporate information.

BACKGROUND TO AND REASONS FOR THE OFFER  (a) Background to the Offer  The Offeror, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TMI, first acquired shares in the Company in Q4 2021. Through additional purchases in Q4 2021 the Offeror established a 26% ownership position in the Company and designated Paul Charles Over to serve on the Company board of directors. On 25 August 2022, TMI delivered to the Company a non-binding indicative proposal to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company not already owned by Offeror through the Proposed Transaction.  (b) Rationale for, and benefits of, the acquisition  Strategic shareholder consolidating ownership position through premium, all cash Offer   The aggregate value of $26.00 per Grindrod Share represents (i) a 26.8% premium to the price per Grindrod Share of US$20.50 on 26 August 2022 being the last traded price per Grindrod Share on the NASDAQ on 26 August 2022 and (ii) a 20.2% premium to the 90-day volume weighted average price of US$22.66 per Grindrod Share prior to the Disclosure Date. The Company’s stock average daily trading volume on the NASDAQ of $7.3m during the 90-day period prior to 26 August 2022 represents 1.4% of the Offer’s $506.3m valuation of the Company being traded each day. The Offer is conditional upon, among other conditions, the Minimum Condition, namely the Offeror owning more than 50.0% of the shares carrying voting rights of the Company.  Certainty of a premium, cash exit for Grindrod investors  The Offer in cash provides an immediate and certain exit opportunity for Grindrod Shareholders at an attractive premium to Grindrod’s undisturbed share price at a time of significant market volatility and economic uncertainty.  Strategic combination creates a significant market player in the mid-sized dry-bulk industry with a fleet of 58 vessels  TMI believes the Offer will create a significant player and owner of mid-sized dry-bulk ships. Together TMI and Grindrod own a fleet of 58 geared vessels (including 6 chartered-in ships, 4 of which have purchase options), providing freight capacity to a high-quality customer base and moving a diversified portfolio of cargoes around the world.  TMI believes complementary fleets have the potential to generate defensive earnings and sustainable dividends, improving average vessel age and carbon intensity.  Scale and global operations to unlock additional revenue and operational cost savings  TMI believes the combination of TMI and the Company would enable the Enlarged Group’s chartering and technical management functions to realise additional value through the enhanced scale and utilization of the combined fleet and charter book. TMI believes the combined fleet will mean that the Enlarged Group’s assets are closer to its customers around the world, enabling TMI and Grindrod’s experienced chartering teams to create additional value through positioning advantages, and the technical teams to make economic, bulk purchases of spares. TMI expects the Enlarged Group to achieve enhanced realised revenue and cost unit economics that are not available to either TMI or Grindrod on a standalone basis.  Conservative business model and capital structure to deliver liquidity and free cash generation  TMI expects that the Enlarged Group will maintain a conservative long-term capital structure. In order to fund the Offer, TMI has arranged an acquisition facility. At 100% acceptances, TMI will exceptionally increase its debt to gross assets ratio to 40% and is committed to reducing this to no more than 25% within 18 months, with the new facility significantly reduced or eliminated within that timeframe.  TMI intends to continue to implement its strategy of employing its ships primarily on period time-charters, utilizing a mix of duration including short term Charters (less than 6 months), medium term Charters (more than 6 months) and long-term Charters (greater than a year) which are expected to benefit from staggered renewals of an even larger fleet, with a view to flattening the income curve.  TMI expects the combined fleet to generate robust free cash flow, which, together with proceeds from vessel sales, as part of overall fleet renewal strategy, are expected to be used by TMI to repay debt.  Resilient and flexible business model  TMI expects the Enlarged Group should benefit from enhanced resilience and improved market access to face potentially more difficult macro environments and in the face of future incoming shipping regulations relating to the environment.  11.

TMI SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL  12.1 The Offer is subject to the approval of TMI’s shareholders in respect of a proposed amendment to TMI’s existing investment policy (the “Investment Policy Amendment”). The Investment Policy Amendment would increase TMI’s maximum aggregate borrowing limit to 40% of gross asset value for acquisition financing, reducing to no more than 25% within 18 months, and would allow for the acquisition of a shipping company with a single investment restriction of 40% of gross asset value reducing to below 30% within 18 months.  12.2 The Investment Policy Amendment is considered to constitute a material change to the Company’s published Investment Policy. Therefore, pursuant to LR 15.4.8(2) of the Listing Rules of the FCA, TMI is required to obtain the approval of TMI Shareholders by way of an ordinary resolution, which requires the approval of a simple majority of the TMI Shareholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting (the “Resolution”).

GRINDROD BOARD RECOMMENDATION   The Independent Company Directors have been advised by Provenance Capital Pte. Ltd. (the “IFA”) in connection with the financial terms of the Offer. Subject to the opinion of the IFA to be issued to the Independent Company Directors (and to be disclosed to the Grindrod Shareholders in the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed by Grindrod to the Grindrod Shareholders) (the “Company Circular”) on whether the financial terms of the Offer are fair and reasonable, the Independent Company Directors preliminarily recommend that the Grindrod Shareholders accept the Offer.  Grindrod Shareholders are advised not to take any action in relation to the Offer until Grindrod Shareholders have carefully considered (a) the Independent Company Directors’ formal recommendation to Shareholders in relation to the Offer in the Company Circular, (b) the advice of the IFA to be disclosed in the Company Circular, and (c) the intentions of the Offeror (where regard should also be had to paragraph 16 (Compulsory Acquisition) and paragraph 17(Listing Status) hereof), to be set out in the offer document referred to in paragraph 18.  15. DISCLOSURES ON HOLDINGS AND DEALINGS IN RELEVANT SECURITIES  15.1 As at the Offer Announcement Date, the Offeror and parties acting in concert with it own or control in aggregate 4,925,023 Shares, representing approximately 25.93% of all the Shares, details of which are set out in Schedule 2.  15.2 Save as disclosed in this Announcement (in particular Schedule 2 and Schedule 3), and based on the latest information available to the Offeror, neither the Offeror nor parties acting in concert with it:  (a) owns, controls or has agreed to acquire any:  (i) Shares;  (ii) securities which carry voting rights in the Company; and  (iii) convertible securities, warrants, options or derivatives in respect of such Shares or securities,         (collectively, the “Company Securities”);  (b) has received any irrevocable undertakings from any party to accept or reject the Offer;  (c) has dealt for value in any Company Securities during the period commencing three months preceding 29 August 2022 and ending on the Offer Announcement Date;  (d) has entered into any arrangement (whether by way of option, indemnity or otherwise) in relation to the Shares which might be material to the Offer; or  (e) has in respect of the Company Securities:  (i) granted a security interest over any Company Securities to another person, whether through a charge, pledge or otherwise;  (ii) borrowed from another person any Company Securities (excluding borrowed Company Securities which have been on-lent or sold); or  (iii) lent any Company Securities to another person.  16. COMPULSORY ACQUISITION   16.1 Pursuant to Section 215(1) of the Companies Act, if the Offeror acquires not less than 90% of the total issued Shares as at the date of the Offer (other than those already held by the Offeror, its related corporations or their respective nominees as at the date of the Offer and which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes any Shares held by the Company in treasury) (the “Compulsory Acquisition Threshold”) within four months after the date of the Offer, the Offeror will be entitled to exercise its rights under Section 215(1) of the Companies Act to compulsorily acquire all the Offer Shares of the Grindrod Shareholders who have not accepted the Offer on the same terms as the Offer.  In such event, the Offeror intends to exercise its right to compulsorily acquire all the Offer Shares of the Grindrod Shareholders who have not accepted the Offer. The Offeror will then proceed to delist the Company from the JSE and NASDAQ and terminate the registration of the Shares with the SEC.  16.2 Pursuant to Section 215(3) of the Companies Act, if the Offeror acquires such number of Offer Shares which, together with Shares held by it, its related corporations and their respective nominees, comprise 90% or more of the total issued Shares, the Grindrod Shareholders who have not accepted the Offer have a right to require the Offeror to acquire their Shares at the Offer Price. Such Grindrod Shareholders who wish to exercise such right are advised to seek their own independent legal advice.  17. LISTING STATUS   Nasdaq  17.1 Depending upon the number of Shares purchased by the Offeror pursuant to the Offer, the Shares may no longer meet the requirements of NASDAQ for continued listing and may be delisted from NASDAQ. According to NASDAQ’s published guidelines, NASDAQ would consider delisting the Shares if, among other things: (i) the number of Shares publicly held falls below 750,000; (ii) the number of holders (including both holders of beneficial interest and holders of record) of Shares falls below 400; or (iii) the market value of such publicly-held Shares is not at least US $5,000,000.  17.2 In addition, following the consummation of the Offer, if NASDAQ does not initiate delisting procedures on its own, the Offeror may decide to cause the Company to voluntarily delist the Shares from NASDAQ, depending upon the number of Shares purchased by the Offeror pursuant to the Offer and the number of holders of the Shares. If the Offeror acquires such number of Offer Shares which, together with Shares held by it, its related corporations and their respective nominees, comprise 90% or more of the total issued Shares within four months after the date of the Offer and the Offeror exercises its rights under Section 215(1) of the Companies Act to compulsorily acquire all the Offer Shares of the Grindrod Shareholders who have not accepted the Offer, the Offeror intends to cause the Company to voluntarily delist the Shares from NASDAQ.  17.3 Registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act, may be terminated upon notice to the SEC if the Shares are neither listed on a national securities exchange in the U.S. nor held by 300 or more holders of record. Termination of such registration of the Shares would substantially reduce the information required to be furnished by the Company to its shareholders and to the SEC and would make certain provisions of such Act no longer applicable to the Company, such as the requirement of furnishing an annual report on Form 20-F to shareholders and the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under such Act with respect to “going private” transactions.  17.4 Grindrod Shareholders should note that the Offeror may seek to delist from NASDAQ and terminate the Company’s registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act in circumstances where the 90% Compulsory Acquisition Threshold is not met, subject to satisfying applicable legal and regulatory requirements (including any requirements imposed by NASDAQ and/or the SEC) at the relevant time.  JSE  17.5 In a scenario where the Offeror exercises its right to compulsorily acquire and acquires or agrees to acquire all of the Offer Shares (in the circumstances contemplated in paragraph 17.1), the Offeror intends to procure that the Company will make an application for the cancellation of the listing of its securities on the List maintained by the JSE and for the cancellation of the admission to trading of the Company’s securities on the Main Board of the JSE.  17.6 It is anticipated that the application for cancellation of the listing on the List maintained by the JSE and the admission to trading on the Main Board of the JSE will take effect no earlier than the commencement of business on the JSE on the date that is 30 JSE Business Days after the publication by the Offeror of an announcement that it is invoking its right to compulsorily acquire all of the Offer Shares.  17.7 Grindrod Shareholders should note that the Offeror may also seek to delist from the JSE in circumstances where the 90% Compulsory Acquisition Threshold is not met, subject to satisfying applicable legal and regulatory requirements (including any requirements imposed by the JSE and/or the South African Reserve Bank) at the relevant time.  17.8 Delisting of the Shares from NASDAQ and the cancellation of the listing on the List maintained by the JSE would significantly reduce the liquidity and marketability of the Shares. Delisting of the Shares from the JSE would significantly reduce the liquidity and marketability of the Shares held on the South African register.   18.

In addition, its placement agent has confirmed that 76.5 million shares made available for application by way of private placement to selected investors have been fully placed out. Managing director Mirzan Mahathir said the oversubscription of the company’s IPO indicates the public’s confidence in its over 30 years of track record in the automotive EMS industry in Malaysia. “This is an encouraging sign as we embark on our next stage of growth as a public-listed company. We believe that our prospects in the automotive EMS industry are favourable, taking into account the recovery and long-term growth of the automotive industry, the sales target of our customer, our competitive strengths and our business strategies,” he said.

The listing also includes an offer for sale of 45 million existing shares to selected investors by way of private placement.

"Conrad Asia Energy Ltd and its stockbrokers are trying to bring the company’s proposed $45 million initial public offering to a head, calling for bids by the end of this week. Broker Bell Potter, a joint lead manager alongside Canaccord Genuity, sent terms through its network on Wednesday, seeking bids by 5pm Thursday ahead of the Friday broker firm and institutional offer close. Conrad Asia Energy is raising funds to progress work at its Mako gas field.  John Woudstra Singapore-registered Conrad is seeking to raise $45 million at $1.46 a security, in a deal that would value the company at $232.7 million on a market capitalisation basis. It left room for another $10 million in oversubscriptions, which would take the offer size to $55 million. If successful it would list on October 26 and be the biggest IPO in Australia this half. The price implied 0.38 times net asset value, the term sheet said, calculated as market capitalisation divided by the net asset value of $US442 million ($609 million).

"Franklin Templeton International, the manager of Fondul Proprietatea (FP), announced it added a new point on the agenda of FP’s November 15 shareholder meeting, namely the listing of the shares held by FP in Hidroelectrica exclusively on the local Stock Exchange (BVB) - as suggested by the Government of Romania.
The agenda still includes the proposal for the dual-listing of Hidroelectricas shares as well.
“The amounts resulting from the partial or entire sale of the package of shares during the secondary public offering shall be distributed to Company’s shareholders as a special dividend within 3 months of the collection of that amount by the Company,” according to the proposal advocated by the Government.
Fondul Proprietatea owns approximately 20% of the total shares of Hidroelectrica, the largest electricity producer in Romania. Among the shareholders of FP are private pension funds Pilon II, the American group Silver Point Capital and mutual funds, and the Romanian Government (5.8%).
The state-owned hydropower producer Hidroelectrica will have its initial public offering by the end of June 2023. The date was agreed upon after talks between prime minister Nicolae Ciucă and other representatives of the Government and a delegation from Fondul Proprietatea.

TUYA FINAL DEADLINE TODAY: ROSEN, A TOP RANKED FIRM, Encourages Tuya Inc. Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Tuesday Deadline in Securities Class Action - TUYA

GlobeNewswire

October 11, 2022



NEW YORK, Oct.  11, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Tuya Inc. (NYSE: TUYA) pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement and related prospectus (collectively, the ""Registration Statement"") issued in connection with Tuya's March 2021 initial public offering (the ""IPO"") of the important October 11, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Tuya securities pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Tuya class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=7007 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than October 11, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the IPO Registration Statement featured false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) a material portion of Tuya's China-based customers were engaged in the widespread and systematic manipulation of reviews and product offerings in violation of Amazon.com's terms of use; (2) prior to the IPO, a consumer investigation and data breach had exposed an illicit fake review scheme being perpetrated by many of Tuya's clients, among others, which included, among other things, the exposure of 13 million records of organized fake review scams linked to over 200,000 Amazon account profiles; (3) as a result, there was a substantial risk that a material portion of Tuya's significant customers would be barred from using Amazon.com's platform, negatively impacting Tuya's business, revenue, earnings, and prospects; and (4) as such, the IPO's Registration Statement's representations regarding Tuya's historical financial and operational metrics and purported market opportunities and expected growth did not accurately reflect the actual business, operations, financial results, and trajectory of Tuya at the time of the IPO. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Tuya class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=7007 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

 LUXUS, the world's first luxury alternative investment platform specializing in precious gems and high jewelry, announces its second IPO, the Golden Dahlia, a rare Fancy Vivid Yellow diamond ring with a market capitalization of $1.5M, selling at $300 per share.
 This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221010005555/en/
 Previously available only to the ultra-wealthy, celebrities, royalty and institutional collectors, LUXUS has made this exclusivity accessible to investors of all levels on its digital platform. With LUXUS' second IPO, investors now have the opportunity to partake in fractional ownership of these rare assets.
 The Fancy Vivid Yellow grade represents the pinnacle of the yellow diamond category, and the Golden Dahlia's antique emerald cut with no inclusions is a true rarity that is highly sought after by collectors, consumers and connoisseurs. LUXUS is making it available for investors for the first time ever.
 Additionally, the high inflationary market environment and geopolitical instability make ultra rare assets like the Golden Dahlia challenging to procure. As investors seek the safe havens of hard assets, demand for scarce precious metals & gems is stronger than ever. ""As LUXUS grows, we are committed to providing investors with access to the world's scarcest assets so that they can effectively hedge their exposure to traditional asset classes. We look forward to releasing research and educational materials in the coming months as the capabilities of our technology platform deepen and our team grows,"" said Founder and CEO, Dana Auslander. ""The Golden Dahlia is one of many exceptional fancy colored diamonds that we intend to offer investors as they explore this emerging asset class.""
 All assets listed on the platform are independently appraised and valued through IGI (International Gemological Institute), the global leader in diamond jewelry grading. Each asset is accompanied by a GIA grading report to ensure authenticity. Further, fancy colored diamonds contain a rarity report from FCRF (Fancy Colored Research Foundation).

" NEW YORK, October 11, 2022 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
 WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of TuSimple Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: TSP): (i) pursuant and/or traceable to the offering documents issued in connection with the Company's initial public offering conducted on or about April 15, 2021 (the ""IPO""); and/or (ii) between April 15, 2021 and August 1, 2022, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the important October 31, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline.
 SO WHAT: If you purchased TuSimple securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
 WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the TuSimple class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=8026 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than October 31, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
 WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
 DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the IPO documents were negligently prepared and, as a result, contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and were not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their preparation. Additionally, the complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding TuSimple's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the IPO documents and defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) TuSimple's commitment to safety was significantly overstated and defendants concealed fundamental problems with the Company's technology; (2) TuSimple was rushing the testing of its autonomous driving technology in order to deliver driverless trucks to the market ahead of its more safety-conscious competitors; (3) there was a corporate culture within TuSimple that suppressed or ignored safety concerns in favor of unrealistically ambitious testing and delivery schedules; (4) the aforementioned conduct made accidents involving TuSimple's autonomous driving technology more likely; (5) the aforementioned conduct invited enhanced regulatory scrutiny and investigatory action toward TuSimple; and (6) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
 To join the TuSimple class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=8026 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
 No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

NEW YORK, Oct. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Parallaxes Capital Management (""Parallaxes"") is an alternative asset manager and, since 2017, has raised four funds dedicated to Tax Receivable Agreements (""TRAs""). As the market leader in monetizing TRAs, Parallaxes is dedicated to increasing the visibility and transparency of TRAs which remain an often overlooked and misunderstood asset class. In the vein of creating greater visibility into the TRA ecosystem, Parallaxes is pleased to highlight a notable development in the market as Clarivate Analytics Plc. (""Clarivate"") previously terminated its TRA.
Clarivate disclosed that it paid $200 million to terminate its TRA liability, recognizing a gain of $65 million. The Clarivate TRA provided for the payment of 85% of the tax savings realized from certain tax attributes, including savings from (i) existing tax attributes acquired in the organizational transactions in connection with the IPO and (ii) net operating loss carryforwards.
Parallaxes views TRAs, including the Clarivate TRA, as a valuable tool to reduce certain moral hazard problems and informational asymmetry inherent in a company's public offering. TRAs help ensure that pre-IPO owners are economically aligned with new public shareholders and incentivize pre-IPO owners to pursue an IPO structure that provides the company with ongoing tax benefits. Parallaxes anticipates enhanced awareness and understanding of TRAs will drive increased market adoption.

 About Parallaxes Capital

"South Korea's largest car-sharing platform operator SOCAR Inc. said Tuesday its initial public offering (IPO) price has been set at 28,000 won (US$21.44) per share, which is much lower than the price range it had hoped for amid apparently weak demand.

The price was determined after SOCAR conducted a two-day demand forecasting from domestic and foreign institutional investors that ended Friday. It was below the lower bound of its target price ranging from 34,000 won to 45,000 won.

Despite the disappointing price setting, the company decided to go ahead with the IPO slated for later this month. It is pushing to sell a total of 3.64 million new shares with a plan to raise 101.92 billion won.

Of the total new shares that it will offer, 910,000 shares, or 25 percent, will be sold to retail investors via subscription that will be held Wednesday and Thursday.

""In consideration of the investors' voice and opinion, we decided to offer our stocks in an investor-friendly manner,"" SOCAR chief executive Park Jae-wook said.

There are concerns that the price band SOCAR had hoped for may have been overpriced, considering unfavorable market conditions, including investors' reduced appetite for risky assets. Global monetary tightening aimed at taming inflation has also weighed on the stock markets.

SOCAR has voiced confidence that it will successfully complete the planned IPO, citing its stellar performance in the car-sharing market in recent years.

With the proceeds from the IPO, SOCAR plans to increase its presence in the mobility market, expand investment in technology and buy promising mobility firms.

In a related move, the company plans within this year to launch a ""super app"" that combines the existing car-sharing services with ""micromobility,"" such as electric bicycles, and platform-based parking services.

Also in the second half of this year, it will test-provide a large-scale vehicle management solution to leading logistics giants, such as Hyundai Glovis Co. and Lotte Global Logistics Co.

"SEOUL-- South Korea's largest car-sharing and mobility service provider SOCAR Inc. on Wednesday said that its planned initial public offering (IPO) will be successful despite unfavorable market conditions.

SOCAR, established in 2011, is seeking to make a market debut later this month after going through IPO subscription Thursday and Friday this week from institutional investors and Wednesday and Thursday next week from retail investors.

It wants the IPO price to be set at between 34,000 won (US$25.60) and 45,000 won, which will help the car-sharing service provider raise up to 205 billion won.

Its market cap after the IPO will range from 1.2 trillion won to 1.6 trillion won.

SOCAR said its stellar performance in the car-sharing market will help make its IPO successful although the local IPO market has been chilly in the face of monetary tightening and a looming economic recession.

""We are confident about SOCAR's performance this year and next year, both in expansion and profitability,"" SOCAR CEO Park Jae-wook said in a press meeting.

""We are not sure exactly how long this upward momentum (in the car-sharing service market) will last, but we cannot miss this opportune moment. It is better to seek ways to fly high with the raised funds,"" he added.

Park said SOCAR's earnings will be able to shift to the black, backed by its 79 percent market share and brand awareness that will reduce its marketing costs.

Thanks to the flourishing single-person households, people are becoming increasingly open to car-sharing, Park said.

According to SOCAR data, 64 percent of its clients are returning customers, and more than 50 percent of its users wish to keep using their SOCAR plans or delay purchases for new cars.

It holds some 19,000 cars for its service across the country. Its sales spiked 31 percent on-year to 289 billion won last year, but it suffered an operating loss of 21 billion won.

SOCAR plans to spend the proceeds from the IPO to raise its presence in the mobility market with investment in technology and the acquisition of promising mobility firms.

Within this year, the company plans to launch a ""super app"" that combines the existing car-sharing services with ""micro mobility,"" such as electric bicycles, and platform-based parking services.

Also in the second half of this year, it will test-provide a large-scale vehicle management solution to leading logistics giants, such as Hyundai Glovis Co. and Lotte Global Logistics Co.

Last year, it bought a 100 percent stake of Nine2one Inc., operator of e-bike sharing service Elecle, and acquired online parking platform service Modu Co. via a share swap.

"SEOUL-- Kyobo Life Insurance Co. on Thursday said the country's bourse operator will begin a preliminary assessment of its initial public offering (IPO).

The Korea Exchange (KRX) has said it will launch a panel to review the IPO bid of South Korea's No. 2 life insurer eight months after its filing.

Kyobo Life has been pushing to go public since 2018, but opposition from its shareholders has halted the process for years.

Kyobo Life Chairman and the largest stakeholder Shin Chang-jae, as well as those with special interests in the company, hold a combined 36.9 percent stake.

If the IPO is successful, Kyobo Life will begin preparing for the introduction of a new accounting rule for insurance products in 2023.

"SEOUL-- ONE store Co., a South Korean mobile app market platform, decided Wednesday to withdraw its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) due to lackluster investor confidence, financial industry sources said.

The No. 2 mobile app market operator here, after Google Play store, received lackluster response from institutional investors during a two-day demand forecasting session until Tuesday, according to the sources. Institutional bids reportedly mostly fell below the company's desired pricing band between 34,300 won ($27) and 41,700 won.

""Just this morning, ONE store considered going public by lowering the desired price, but they apparently decided to scrap the plan after concluding the company's value may not be properly recognized by the market under the current stock market situation,"" a source said.

ONE store's affiliate SK shieldus also nixed its IPO plan last week due to weak investor sentiment.

Lee Jae-hwan, CEO of ONE store, said in a press conference on Monday that the company was determined to get listed on the main bourse as planned this month, undeterred by the sister company's derailed attempt.

ONE store is the latest among several South Korean companies that have backpedaled on IPO plans so far this year. In late January, Hyundai Engineering Co., the construction arm of Hyundai Motor Group, withdrew its plan to get its stocks listed on the country's main bourse due to adverse market conditions.

ONE store logged 214 billion won in sales last year and an operating loss of 5.8 billion won. The company racked up 1.13 trillion won worth of transactions on its platform last year.

Its market share in the local mobile app market stands at some 14 percent, with Google Play's presence coming in at 71.9 percent.

"SEOUL-- SK shieldus Co., a security arm of South Korean telecom giant SK Telecom Co., is expected to raise up to 3.55 trillion won (US$2.85 billion) through a planned initial public offering (IPO) next month.

The listing, set for May 19, will mark the biggest ever market debut by a security service provider, more than the value of its rival firm S-1 Corp., a security firm under Samsung Group.

""Our company integrated cybersecurity and physical security services. SK shieldus should not be compared with S-1 by one-to-one,"" CEO Park Jin-hyo said at an online conference.

SK shieldus, which changed its name from ADT Caps Co. last October, currently provides security services across four main categories -- cybersecurity, convergence security, physical security, and safety and care.

Last year, the company reported 1.55 trillion won in sales, trailing behind 2.31 trillion won recorded by S-1.

Park said the company aims to take over other security companies with higher technical skills following the IPO, and hire more personnel with expertise in platform.

SK shieldus said it set the IPO price range of 31,000-38,800 won.

Credit Suisse, the lead bookrunner, Morgan Stanley, KB Securities and NH Investment and Securities began taking orders from investors.

Demand forecasting for domestic institutions is slated for May 3 and May 4, with that for retail investors set to take place on May 9 and May 10.

"SEOUL-- SK On Co. is not considering an initial public offering (IPO) for at least another two to three years but will build up its competitiveness and enhance corporate value before pushing for a market debut, head of its parent company said Thursday.

The potential listing of SK On has drawn attention since the battery unit was spun off from SK Innovation in October last year, as part of SK's push to bolster the battery business amid growing demand from global automakers vying for a bigger share in the electric vehicle market.

""What's the most important for an IPO to take place is that we need to have our battery business recognized in the market,"" Kim Jun, CEO and vice chairman of SK Innovation Co., told reporters after a general shareholders meeting.

""I expect that we should be able to deliver the performance, in terms of sales, profitability and stable management of equipment, after 2025, and I believe it would be after 2025 if we were to do an IPO,"" he said.

Its bigger rival, LG Energy Solution Ltd., set a record IPO in January that made the battery maker the second-largest company in South Korea by market cap, reflecting the global electrification trend.

Kim said SK On is at the pre-IPO stage to raise funds from investors in advance of going public.

""We need large-scale resources as we are continuing with the facility expansion ... We plan to sign the contracts (on the investments) in the first half,"" Kim said.

Industry sources predict SK On is seeking to raise between 3 and 5 trillion won (US$2.47-4.12 billion), which amounts to about a 10 percent stake in the company.

Kim forecast SK On will swing to the black in the fourth quarter of this year and achieve an annual surplus from next year. SK Innovation's battery business logged an operating loss of 683.1 billion won in the fourth quarter of last year.

In light of any possible advance into new businesses, Kim said he is looking at areas of ""non-carbon, or low-carbon energy sources,"" and discussing various ideas with SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, without elaborating further.

Earlier this month, Chey hinted at ""drawing up a new business map that incorporates energy and environment"" during a visit to a SK Innovation factory in a southwestern city.

"SEOUL– The amount of money South Korean firms raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) more than quadrupled to hit a record high last year thanks to ample liquidity and the overall bullish stock market sentiment, data showed Monday.

A total of 89 companies went public in 2021 by listing stocks on the benchmark KOSPI and secondary tech-heavy KOSDAQ markets and raised a combined 19.7 trillion won (US$16.4 billion), according to the data from the Financial Supervisory Service.

The money raised from IPOs represented a 333.9 percent surge from 4.5 trillion won a year earlier, the data showed. The number of companies whose shares listed on the stock markets for the first time also jumped from the previous year’s 70.

The IPO market was driven by the overall rise in local stock markets and ample liquidity injected into the economy bolstered by low borrowing costs in line with record low policy rates intended to boost the pandemic-hit economy.

Investors got more interested in new stock listings, with the competition ratio for IPO stocks jumping to an average of 1,136 to 1 last year, up from the 956-to-1 ratio a year earlier.

The prices of newly listed stocks closed 57.4 percent higher on average on their first trading day, compared with their IPO prices. The return marked the highest in five years, the data showed.

Their average prices also jumped 54.8 percent at the end of last year from the IPO prices. But of the companies that went private, 28 firms, or 31.5 percent, saw their stocks fall below the IPO prices at the end of last year, the data showed.

 A KakaoBank logo is seen next to a Kakao Friends character. (KakaoBank)Amid the white-hot stock rally of 2021, they were the envy of all.Those working at the year’s biggest market debutants Krafton and Kakao Bank were given chances to buy stocks in their company at a set price, via employee share ownership plans.However, none of those who bought the employee stocks are seeing profits now, as the shares are currently trading at less than half the price they paid.On Blind, an anonymous workplace community app, a verified Kakao Bank employee revealed a loss of 400 million won ($280,164) in his employee stock investment.“(Kakao Bank workers) are at risk of becoming credit delinquents,” the user wrote.""People at the company borrowed every single penny from friends and family members (to buy as many employer stocks as possible) because we were so certain about the stock’s return prospects.”Another post spoke of how the office atmosphere has recently gone from cheerful around the time of its initial public offering last year to gloomy.Kakao Bank, a mobile banking arm of Kakao, made last year’s second biggest IPO, raising 2.55 trillion won on its August, 2021 listing on Korea’s main Kospi bourse.Shares of the company closed at 17,750 won on Wednesday, less than half of the IPO price of 39,000 won.Kakao Bank employees have purchased 12.74 million shares, some 19.5 percent of the total offerings. This translates into an average of 12,500 shares per employee, worth 490 million won at the time of purchase.The situation at Krafton appears to be similar.Its once-envied employee share ownership plan has turned into a nightmare.Krafton was the star of last year’s IPO market, raising a whopping 4.3 trillion won in August. It was the biggest share listing in Korea last year and the second-biggest in the country’s capital market history.Employees at the game firm have acquired 4.1 percent of the total offer, or 351,525 shares, at 498,000 won apiece. This translates into an average of 264 shares per employee and a per-capita investment of 131.47 million won.Krafton’s stock closed at 180,500 won Wednesday, sharply down from the IPO price.Both Kakao Bank and Krafton employee stockholders were not able to divest their investments while they were making profit due to a one-year lock-up.Kakao Bank stock recorded an all-time high of 94,400 won on Aug. 20, 2021, soon after the listing. Krafton stocks peaked at 580,000 on Nov. 17, 2021. The lock-up period expired in August this year for both.The loss is only on paper, unless realized. But employees who have used leverage for the investment are left with a choice between two undesirable options – selling with a great loss or enduring the time of rising interest rates in hope of a turnaround one day.Worse off are those who have taken on securities-based loans. As the value of the equity continues to fall, they face forced liquidation. To avoid that, additional collateral must be provided.On Oct. 7, Kakao Bank CEO Yoon Ho-young said the company would review a set of shareholder return policies, including buybacks.""We will actively review shareholder return policies, such as share buyback or share retirement, by the time the 2022 account settlement is approved at a shareholder meeting,"" Yoon said in an internal message sent to employees.Early this year, Krafton founder and board chairman Chang Byung-gyu reportedly spent 30 billion won buying company stocks in what appears to be a failed attempt to help boost their market value.On Wednesday, Korea Investment & Securities slashed its target price for Krafton shares to 270,000 won per share. The same brokerage had suggested 580,000 won for the stock in August 2021. By Park Han-na (hnpark@heraldcorp.com)

The corporate logo of Kurly (Kurly)The long-awaited market debut of Kurly, operator of South Korean e-commerce platform Market Kurly, is expected to be decided soon as the nation’s bourse operator is scheduled to hold a final review session next week, according to industry sources on Tuesday. If the company gets a green light from the Korea Exchange during the session, it is ready to go public. Following a book building process, its share price will be decided. The issue is investor sentiment amid a lukewarm initial public offering market this year. A Kurly official told The Korea Herald that it is “too early to tell” whether the company should consider withdrawing its IPO.“Pending on the results of the final review, we will decide when will be the best time to get listed,” the official added.Although Kurly filed for the review procedure five months ago, the Korea Exchange had expressed concerns about the possibility of its founder’s dwindling control over the firm. Kim Seul-ah, Kurly’s CEO and founder, is the company’s sixth-largest shareholder with a tiny 5.75 percent stake, while more than half the shares are owned by foreign investors, notably Chinese funds such as SCC Growth V Holdco H, Ltd and HH Sum-xi Holdings Limited.The Korea Exchange said the company might face a series of exits from shareholders or hostile mergers and acquisitions because Kim does not hold enough shares to protect her management rights.As per the bourse operator’s request, most of Kurly’s financial investors turned in affirmation documents last month stating that they will not sell their shares before 18 months after the IPO. They also promised to hold a joint voting rights session when selling more than 20 percent of their shares.In order to diversify its business portfolio, the company has announced that it will launch a marketplace service, acting as an intermediary between home appliance providers and buyers starting next month. It also recently began exporting ready-made foods to Singapore.But industry insiders say Kurly might not receive a fair valuation from the market, falling short of its expected corporate value of some 4 trillion won-5 trillion won ($3.1 billion-$3.8 billion).“Currently it is not the best timing for an IPO. So I don’t think Kurly will reach 4 trillion won in valuation,” said Seo Yong-ku, a business professor at Sookmyung Women‘s University. “The company will have to work hard to successfully make an appeal to institutional investors with its value-adding business plan.”Car-sharing platform SoCar, which recently completed its book building process, had to lower its IPO price, decreasing its estimated corporate value from 1 trillion won to 966.5 billion won.Rival e-commerce platforms such as SSG.com have postponed their IPOs to next year. Oasis, which said it plans to go public this year, has yet to start the process due to the IPO market downturn.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

SoCar CEO Park Jae-wook speaks during a press conference at Conrad Seoul in Yeouido, Seoul on Aug. 3. (SoCar)Amid dampened appetite for initial public offerings, South Korean car-sharing company SoCar is facing lukewarm response from institutional investors, with a growing possibility that it may join this year’s long list of market debut flops.According to industry sources, during the two-day book building period on Thursday and Friday, institutional investors had written their preferred share price below 34,000 won ($26), lower than the price band of 34,000 won-45,000 won suggested by the company.The company plans to float 4.55 million shares, aiming for a market capitalization of between 1.2 trillion won and 1.6 trillion won.Following the book building results, which will be announced Tuesday, SoCar can either lower its IPO price and go public, or withdraw its application for a market debut on the benchmark Kospi. The company is scheduled to launch its IPO for retail investors on Aug. 10 and 11 with Mirae Asset Securities as the main underwriter.In addition to the dramatic slowdown of IPO market, the car-sharing platform’s IPO pitch has raised concerns of overvaluation here.When setting the preferred share price, SoCar selected three companies -- GoTo, Ovigo and Aurora -- although it shares little similarities in terms of business portfolios, as major peer groups.GoTo’s 37 percent of sales is generated through e-commerce transactions and both Ovigo and Aurora profit from offering a smart car software platform and self-driving solutions.But more than 97 percent of SoCar’s first-quarter sales revenue came from short-term rentals -- even several hours.Industry insiders pointed out that the company left out any car rental companies like SK Rent-a-Car and Lotte Rental from the peer group in order to receive a higher valuation.SoCar CEO Park Jae-wook said at Wednesday’s press conference, “Unlike car rental firms who make profit through selling used cars, we are the only mobility company that operates both car-sharing services and a mobility software business.”“Also, not only have we last year surpassed global mobility platforms in terms of pre-tax profits, but will be the first mobility company in the world to turn a profit starting this year,” Park added.Sources say companies will have to set their preferred share prices more conservatively if they wish to make a successful debut on the sluggish market.Compared to the record-breaking IPOs during the last two years, major companies that had planned to get listed ditched IPO plans this year due to fears of undervaluation.Hyundai Oilbank, whose market value was worth 10 trillion won, scrapped its IPO plan before the book building, citing that it is difficult to receive fair value estimate from the current market.Hyundai Engineering, SK Shieldus and One Store withdrew its IPO application after failing to convince less-than-impressed institutional investors.CJ Oliveyoung, one of the country’s leading beauty retailers, also indefinitely postponed its market debut, before even applying for a preliminary review with the Korea Exchange.Upcoming listings of major IPOs scheduled this year include the e-commerce platform Market Kurly, which is expected to reach around 2-6 trillion won. Others include K-Bank, an internet-only bank, and Golfzon County, a golf course operator, receiving value estimates of 6-8 trillion won and 2 trillion won, respectively.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

SoCar CEO Park Jae-wook speaks during a press conference at Conrad Seoul in Yeouido, Seoul. (SoCar)South Korean car-sharing company SoCar said Wednesday it planned to debut in the nation‘s benchmark Kospi to expand its footing in the mobility industry worth 350 trillion won (267.6 billion) and growing.The company will decide soon whether to float 4.55 million shares or not on Aug. 22 after testing the water with the two-day preliminary proceedings scheduled on Thursday and Friday. The preferred share price is set between 34,000 won and 45,000 won. The main underwriter is Mirae Asset Securities.“We will use 60 percent of the IPO funds to acquire startups including self-driving tech companies, 20 percent to boost mobility software, electric bicycle and parking business, and the remaining 20 percent to invest in research and development of innovative technologies,” said Park Jae-wook, SoCar CEO, during a press conference.Park said the SoCar app will start providing reservation services for the high-speed KTX train by this year and even electric bicycle-sharing and car parking services in the near future.The company is also gearing up to enter the global mobility market with its Fleet Management System, which monitors and compiles data including car mileage, location, and performance indicators on engines, batteries and vehicle consumables.Domestic players like Hyundai Glovis, a supply chain management arm under Hyundai Motor Group, and Lotte Global Logistics, logistic firm under the retail giant Lotte Group, have already signed deals to adopt SoCar’s software system.SoCar also plans to expand self-driving service to regions other than Jeju Island.Park stressed that as the first mobility Unicorn in Korea, SoCar has taken a more-than 79 percent share of the domestic car-sharing market. It operates more than 19,000 cars and 4,500 car-sharing zones in the metropolitan region and other major cities such as Daejeon, Busan, Daegu and Gwangju.“Despite the coronavirus pandemic, our sales revenue has increased on-year by 31.2 percent and 35.3 percent last year and the first half of 2022, respectively,” said Park. “In terms of profit before tax, we posted minus 0.9 percent, surpassing that of global mobility giants like Grab, Uber and GoTo, which logged minus 153 percent to minus 17 percent.”Park said the company was expected to turn a profit this year based on improving business efficiency and the growing number of paid membership users. “Although we are buying more cars to meet the growing demand for car-sharing, margin per car is increasing. The 162,000 membership users frequently use our service, becoming the key source of surge in sales as well.”Park added that despite the dramatic slowdown of IPO market, he expects SoCar to receive a high valuation thanks to its profit-generating business portfolios and the fast-growth of the mobility market.“Also, the second and third largest shareholders, SK Inc. and Lotte Rental signed a deal not to sell their shares during the lock-up period of six months after the IPO,” Park said.Founded in 2011, SoCar provides car-sharing, electric bicycle-sharing and parking services. Last year, it sold a 60 percent stake in Tada, the company’s mobility platform subsidiary, to the fintech giant Toss.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

(Hyundai Oilbank)Hyundai Heavy Industries Group’s refining affiliate Hyundai Oilbank has withdrawn its application for an initial public offering with local bourse operator Korea Exchange, the firm said Thursday.The decision, which was reached Wednesday, comes after a general evaluation of the recent stock market conditions and stock price trend of other refineries, according to Hyundai Oilbank.“In the current market situation where it is difficult to be recognized properly by our excellent performance, we judged that there is no reason to push for IPO anymore,” a Hyundai Oilbank official said in a statement.The oil refiner earned a record revenue of 20.6 trillion won ($15.7 billion) last year, up 50.5 percent on-year, and an operating profit of 1.14 trillion won, backed by rising oil demand.But with South Korean stocks dipping over fears of a global recession, increased interest rates and economic headwinds ahead, other companies such as Hyundai Engineering and SK Shieldus that filed for an IPO this year have also backed out.“Although we have decided not to continue with the IPO plan, we will continue to invest in future businesses such as petrochemical materials, biofuels and hydrogen and also work on improving our financial structure,” Hyundai Oilbank said.Hyundai Oilbank filed for an initial public offering last December — the third of its kind after the refiner suspended the IPO process in 2012 and in 2019.By Hong Yoo (yoohong@heraldcorp.com)

Kyobo Life Insurance headquarters in Seoul. (Kyobo Life Insurance)South Korea’s Kyobo Life Insurance and its second-largest shareholder -- a consortium led by Affinity Equity Partners -- are blaming each other for its recent failure to carry out an initial public offering. The blame game follows the nation’s sole bourse operator Korea Exchange’s decision on July 8 to reject an initial public offering by Kyobo, without citing a reason. Market watchers, however, cited Kyobo’s yearslong legal dispute with the consortium led by the Hong Kong-based private equity firm behind the KRX’s latest move. “Our IPO plan was canceled because of Affinity’s disruption,” Kyobo said in a statement released Friday. “Affinity must cooperate as two-thirds of our shareholders have agreed with our IPO plan,” it added. As of end-2021, Kyobo CEO Shin Chang-jae and related parties stood as the insurer’s largest shareholder with 36.91 percent, while the consortium led by Affinity held a 9.05 percent stake, making it the second-largest shareholder. Other notable shareholders include Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan with a 7.62 percent stake, the Korea Export-Import Bank with 5.85 percent and a consortium led by local private equity firm IMM PE with 5.23 percent. Affinity refused to back down and released a statement on the same day saying that, “All faults and responsibilities for Kyobo’s IPO failure is with its CEO Shin who has failed to uphold his side of the bargain among shareholders.”At the core of the dispute lies Kyobo and Affinity’s failure to get on the same page about the insurer’s IPO price. Kyobo has expressed its desire to set its IPO price based on the current market conditions, while Affinity has been calling for the price to be set at 409,912 won ($311.41) per share based on the put option agreement signed with the Korean insurer in 2012. The consortium claims that the 2012 put option contract obligates Shin to buy out its shares unless he had succeeded in floating the company by 2015. But no initial public offering has yet to take place. In October 2018, the consortium exercised the option. But Shin refused to buy out the shares, citing the exorbitant price of 409,912 won per share. The International Chamber of Commerce intervened at the group’s request, but the two parties have yet to settle their differences. A tribunal, which has already said the contract itself remains valid, is now asked to rule on how the two should set the price, though the decision is not expected anytime soon.Kyobo Life had been seeking to complete an IPO within the first half of this year to diversify its funding sources to brace for the adoption of a new accounting rule for insurance products here in 2023. Its second IPO application was filed in December.(mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

A couple of taxis using Kakao Mobility’s ride-hailing service Kakao T wait for passengers in front of Seoul station on June 28. (Yonhap)A dispute between Kakao Corp. management and its labor union is growing over the IT giant’s rumored attempt to sell its transportation service subsidiary Kakao Mobility to private equity firm MBK Partners. Kakao’s labor union on Wednesday accused the management of giving up on its mobility business, questioning if the sell-off to the private equity fund can help the business grow.According to the union’s statement, Kakao Corp. said its mobility platform cannot grow anymore under its wing, and that the IT giant has no intention of continuing with the mobility business. It added that Kakao’s management said the sale was necessary for the business to expand. The union sees the sale of Kakao Mobility as an attempt to prevent Kakao founder Kim Beom-su from being asked to appear at the National Assembly’s state audit this year. It said it would resume collecting signatures from Kakao Corp. employees for a petition, which was launched in June when rumors of a sale first began swirling, to oppose the deal. Shortly after the union’s statement was released, Bae Jae-hyun, the company’s chief investment officer, downplayed the sale rumors. He said in an internal notice that the company has never considered an entire sell-off.“What we are considering is changing Kakao’s stake in (Kakao Mobility) to become the second-largest shareholder by selling (a 10-19 percent stake),” he said. This suggests MBK would also buy shares from other owners to become the largest shareholder. Kakao Corp. owns a 57.5 percent stake in Kakao Mobility while a consortium led by US private equity firm TPG holds a 29 percent stake and the Carlyle Group has a 6.2 percent stake.The CIO added that the company is contemplating how Kakao Mobility can grow bigger beyond Kakao Corp.’s boundaries, saying no decisions had been made. The union last month met with the IT giant’s leadership including Kim Sung-su, chairman of the board of directors, to oppose the sale.Kakao Mobility went into turmoil after June 14 when it was reported that MBK Partners -- one of the largest private equity firms in Asia -- was in talks with the IT giant to buy a 40 percent stake in Kakao Mobility, which was valued at 8.5 trillion won ($6.6 billion).   Despite Kakao Corp.’s explanation that nothing was decided at the time, the sudden news sparked outcry from employees, as the company even had picked underwriters in March to go public on the Korea Exchange this year. Kakao’s labor union then began collecting signatures of employees and staged protests to oppose the sale of Kakao Mobility. The union denounced Kakao Corp.’s leadership for reneging on its promise to undergo an initial public offering. Previous IPOs of Kakao subsidiaries have included stock options for employees.Prospects of a stock listing have faded due to weak market conditions and damage to the corporation’s image after Kakao Pay executives dumped shares in the company in December last year. The executives, including Ryu Young-joon, CEO of Kakao Corp.’s mobile payment unit, exercised their stock options to sell company shares only a month after Kakao Pay’s listing, reaping a windfall of almost 90 billion won.“Kakao pulled out the sell-off card just three months after it had vowed to carry out shareholder-friendly policies. Isn’t the company trying to retrieve its investment in a different way as the option of going public is likely blocked?” said the union. A staffer at one of Kakao Corp.’s subsidiaries told The Korea Herald that Kakao Mobility employees have been feeling “uneasy” as the direction of the company is now unclear. “We don’t know too much about what’s going on with the rumored sell-off. We just hope things become clear soon,” said the staffer who requested anonymity. Kakao Corp. is under pressure to resolve things one way or another, as an IPO this year was among the conditions of the minority shareholders’ investments in Kakao Mobility. It is almost certain that there would be penalty clauses for failing to list, such as a requirement to buy back shares at an elevated price or to engage in a joint sale to a third party.But with the stock market in freefall, MBK Partners will be in no hurry to complete the acquisition, according to an analyst at a local private equity firm. “The value of technology stocks has decreased, so I think it is unlikely (for MBK Partners) to buy (Kakao Mobility) at the value of 8.5 trillion won. MBK Partners has no reason to go for that price at the moment,” he said. The analyst noted that MBK Partners will also consider tag-along rights of TPG and the Carlyle Group during negotiations with Kakao Corp. Tag-along rights allow minority shareholders to sell their shares if a majority shareholder is negotiating a stake sale. If MBK Partners were to acquire a 40 percent stake from Kakao Corp. as well as all shares owned by TPG and the Carlyle Group, it would approximately cost 6.4 trillion won. “Such a large deal could put some burden on MBK Partners, so won’t they try to push the price further down?” the analyst said. Since the second half of last year, Kakao Mobility has been under fire for hiking ride-hailing fees and expanding into new business areas to provide designated driver services, quick delivery and parcel delivery. The mobility application operator faced heat from the public as its expanded services drove small merchants and business owners out of work.  An IT industry source told The Korea Herald that the sale of Kakao Mobility could give Kakao Corp. some breathing room. “Kakao’s public image has worsened over the past year and Kakao Mobility was one of the major reasons behind that. So I think Kakao might want to detach itself from the mobility business. If a deal is made, it would give Kakao instant cash,” the source said. After Kakao Mobility began as a spinoff subsidiary from Kakao Corp. in 2017, it quickly became the country’s largest mobility platform service provider. Kakao Mobility has 30 million cumulative users and 10 million monthly active users, as of July.The company recorded annual sales of 546 billion won last year, almost doubling from 2020, and posted operating profits of 12.5 billion won to be in the black for the first time.By Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)

Advertisement for Toss Bank`s savings account(Toss Bank)Saving money is never fun. But when combined with a digital pet that grows alongside the size of your savings, it can be more motivating. South Korea’s three internet-only banks -- KakaoBank, K bank and Toss Bank -- have launched unique products such as Tamagotchi-like savings accounts, mobile joint accounts and digital piggy banks to lure customers attracted to the trends. Toss Bank, launched in October last year, has registered 3.6 million users in just eight months through a slew of unique savings products and digital-friendly services. One of them is a Tamagotchi-like savings account in which a user can see a randomly selected digital pet -- turtle, octopus, colt or ghost -- grow with deposits for six months. The digital pet idea has been met with booming demand, as Toss opened 100,000 new accounts within 72 hours of its launch on June 14. Users can deposit a maximum 1 million won ($773) per month for a total of six months with a yield of 3 percent. “The act of saving money requires time and patience, and we wanted to change that time into a fun experience of raising a cute pet for our users,” Toss Bank CEO Hong Min-take told reporters at a media event in Seoul on Tuesday. Toss Bank also plans to launch a joint mobile account “soon,” Hong added, which will cater to friends and groups seeking to split the bill for their favorite activities. The nation’s No. 1 internet-only bank by users, KakaoBank -- with 19.13 million users -- has rolled out various accounts and services tied to its sister company and top mobile messenger KakaoTalk. In this sense, 11.39 million users had opened one of its joint accounts as of May. KakaoTalk currently has some 45 million monthly active users in a country of about 51 million.Its short-term 26-week savings account, a rare product here, was met with high demand upon its launch on June 21, registering 150,000 new accounts within 72 hours. The bank’s piggy bank services are also a key product, allowing users to make deposits of less than 1,000 won on its mobile account daily. The bank managed some 4.35 million piggy bank accounts as of the end of April. K bank is somewhat behind its two rivals in providing unique services, but it is the only mobile bank here providing a real-name account for cryptocurrency trading. Its partnership with local crypto exchange Upbit, signed in June 2020, has helped more than triple its users from 2.19 million in 2020 to some 7 million as of end-2021. K bank’s initial public offering plans, which have been stalled for years, have been gaining pace with the firm filing for a preliminary review for listing on the Korean market with the Korea Exchange on Thursday. Its IPO is predicted to be valued at at least 6 trillion won and the firm is forecast to debut in November, according to market watchers. Korea’s internet-only banks have been expanding quickly in recent years, backed by an increase in the use of smartphones and keeping traditional lenders on their toes with user-friendly services. KakaoBank’s earnings jumped about 80 percent on-year in 2021, with net income amounting to 204.12 billion won, according to a regulatory filing. Operating profit more than doubled over the cited period to 256.94 billion won, and sales also expanded 32.4 percent on-year to 1.06 trillion won.K bank recorded a net profit of 22.4 billion won last year, swinging into the black from a net loss of 105.4 billion won the previous year. Toss Bank, being relatively new to the market, has yet to release its earnings. Its total loans stood at some 4 trillion won as of last month, with 36 percent being taken out by low- and mid-rated customers.(mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

(Kakao Pay)Kakao Pay employees who own shares in their own company each lost an average 20 million won ($15,600) due to the mobile payment firm’s stock price plunge since January, reports said Sunday. The company’s employee stock ownership association purchased a total 3.4 million shares in Kakao Pay at the price of 90,000 won per share prior to its initial public offering on Nov. 3 last year, according to a regulatory filing. Documents show that some 800 employees received an average 4,005 shares each, valued at 360.4 million won at the time of the firm’s market debut. It had set the IPO price at 90,000 won per share, opened at the price of 180,000 won and closed higher at 193,000 won on its first day.But Kakao Pay employees have each lost some 20 million won after the company’s share price plunged over a slew of risks since January, the reports said. The mobile payment operator hit a 52-week-low in terms of closing price on Friday with 85,100, closing 3.73 percent lower from the previous session.Kakao Pay shares lost its rally after it was found in January that former CEO Ryu Young-joon and seven other executives offloaded 90 billion won of company shares by exercising stock option in December, only a month after the company went public. Furthermore, the firm’s second-largest shareholder Alipay dumped 5 million shares -- about 10 percent of the total stake it holds in Kakao Pay -- in a block deal, sending the payment platform operator’s price down 15.57 percent from the previous closing to 89,500 won on Wednesday. Alipay remains the second-largest shareholder, with a 34.72 percent stake in the Korean firm. Members of Kakao Pay’s employee stock ownership association are legally obligated to keep their shares until Nov. 3 this year, a year since the firm’s IPO launch. (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

Graphs showing the change in stock price for Kakao, Kakao Pay and KakaoBank (The Korea Herald)Kakao Pay shares tumbled Wednesday morning after it was reported that its second-largest shareholder Alipay was looking to sell 5 million shares -- about 10 percent of the total stake it holds in Kakao Pay -- in a block deal. The stock price of Kakao Pay fell 15.57 percent to close at 89,500 won. Despite the sell-off, the payment arm of IT giant Kakao said Alipay will continue to be a strategic investor and remain the second-largest shareholder, with 34.72 percent of Kakao Pay shares, and the two sides will carry on with their strong partnership. Experts, however, said this could be the beginning of an ugly turn of events. An analyst at a local securities firm told The Korea Herald that the risk of overhang remains with Alipay’s block deal. “Alipay holds a lot more Kakao Pay shares, so it could sell some of the remaining amount or more. This possibility of dumping off shares has a negative impact for other shareholders as it was seen in today’s price drop,” the analyst said. Park Sang-hyun, an insight provider at independent investment research network Smartkarma, pointed out that Alipay’s return on its Kakao Pay investment is 10 times, so it may be natural to realize a profit to some extent. “But the local market believes that the strategic partnership is cracking, starting with this stake sale. It is highly likely that Alipay will go through a multiphased stake sale process,” Park added. The sharp drop in Kakao Pay’s stock price marked the latest hiccup in a series of disappointments for Kakao Group in the past nine months.In June 2021, Kakao Group became South Korea’s fifth-largest business group in terms of market capitalization at 79.3 trillion won ($65.1 billion), behind the country’s traditional conglomerates: Samsung, SK, LG and Hyundai Motor Group. About a month later, Kakao founder Kim Beom-su was ranked as the richest person in the country by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His net worth was estimated at $13.4 billion. The report said Kim was an exemplary case of how a self-made entrepreneur could succeed in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, which has long been dominated by its family-controlled conglomerates.The tech giant, which rose to prominence with its messenger app KakaoTalk, climbed up the ladder through aggressive expansion of businesses. At the end of the first half of 2021, Kakao had over 150 subsidiaries and affiliates in and out of the country. However, the platform behemoth’s heyday did not last long. The company -- once touted for the legendary tale of its self-made entrepreneur founder and the success of technological innovation in the 21st century -- has undergone a series of blunders and setbacks in recent months. In September, Kakao’s people-friendly image first faced criticism over the company’s rapid expansion, said to have driven small merchants out of business. That led to Kakao’s pledge to pull back some of the company’s services in industries such as snacks and flower delivery.To avert public criticism, Kakao vowed to create a fund of 300 billion won to support small firms and the self-employed, but its misfortunes continued.In the same month, the founder’s investment company K Cube Holdings -- the de facto holding company of Kakao -- was accused of having private interests as well as the illegal succession of family members in employment. More allegations piled on, as K Cube Holdings was accused of fabricating regulatory documents.Kim later apologized at a National Assembly state audit, saying the investment company would change to be committed to social responsibilities.A series of megasized initial public offering deals that further raised Kakao’s market profile, ironically, exposed the root cause for its downfall.A mass sale of Kakao Pay shares by executives including Ryu Young-joon, the then-appointee for Kakao’s next co-CEO, struck the company hard in January.Ryu, who was CEO of Kakao’s mobile payment unit Kakao Pay, was found to have exercised his stock option to sell company shares in December, only a month after the company’s listing. Through this, he and several senior executives collected a total profit of almost 90 billion won, with Ryu taking about half of the gains. Kakao saw fierce backlash from the company’s labor union, retail investors and the general public as the executives raked in massive profits at the expense of investors. Combined with the group’s hasty expansion that had hit small businesses last year, the irresponsible money-making decision raised concerns over whether the IT group could maintain accountable corporate governance. Kakao released an apology, vowing to ban CEOs and executives at its subsidiaries from selling company shares within one to two years after being listed on the market through setting up a new control tower. In March, Kim resigned from his chairman post of the board of directors, leaving behind ailing stock prices and loss of trust among investors.   Kakao’s stock price, which hit as high as 169,500 won per share at the close of June 23, 2021, has halved to a little over 80,000 won per share almost a year later. The stock prices of Kakao Pay and KakaoBank have also suffered similar or worse downfalls, losing trillions of won in the process. On top of losing confidence from the market, the IT giant has irked its own crew.Last week, Kakao unveiled its new “metaverse” working system where employees could basically work wherever they want. The seemingly future-oriented scheme, however, was met with internal resistance from employees, as the new system would require being connected online through a voice channel at all times. Kakao workers expressed concerns and discontent on an in-house online community space, saying the new policy was as an attempt to spy on employees. Kakao CEO Namkoong Whon later said in an announcement to staff that being connected to the voice channel would be decided by crew members in different groups or work areas, but did not scrap the plan. Regarding the implementation of a mandatory working time from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., he said the company will reconsider the plan through communication with staff. Without working on mending ties with stakeholders in and out of the company, Kakao instead unveiled its new vision, “Kakao Universe,” on Tuesday, saying it wants to go beyond Korea. The CEO said they will look to reach 5 billion people across the world through open links that connect them based on their interests instead of targeting South Korea’s 50 million domestic users. But if Kakao cannot redeem itself as the people-friendly company it once was with the rise of its dominant messenger app, experts say it will be difficult for the company to win back people’s hearts and bounce back. “I think Kakao’s stock prices are not doing well due to its subsidiaries going public. Naver has only one entity in the bourse, but Kakao’s other firms have been listed and this has cemented Kakao’s image as a firm that conducts (IPOs) to sell shares to make money,” an analyst at a local private equity firm told The Korea Herald. “Kakao’s growth has been done through mergers and acquisitions, as well as some unethical moves such as taking the business of small merchants. Its corporate governance is also seemingly abominable,” he added.By Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)

Corporate logo of Millie’s Library (Millie’s Library)Millie’s Library, one of South Korea’s largest e-book subscription platform, said Sunday that it is set for a market debut by the end of this year.The company filed a preliminary prospectus on Friday stating that it will offer 2 million common shares out of the total 8,234,901 shares. If the initial public offering process goes as planned, it will be the country’s first e-book platform to go public.Its shares are poised to start trading on the Korea Exchange’s secondary Kosdaq. The lead manager of the envisioned IPO is Mirae Asset Securities.The corporate value of Millie’s Library is estimated to be around 300 billion won ($239 million), according to market insiders.With funds raised from the IPO, the company plans to invest in the production of original book content as well as other content.The company’s sales revenue surged on-year by 61 percent to 28.9 billion won last year. However, it posted an operating loss of 34.8 billion won, and has still not turned a profit.Millie’s Library has been seeking to accelerate growth momentum after it was acquired by Genie Music, the music streaming platform under KT, in 2021. Genie Music currently holds 39 percent of the shares of the company.Working with the KT artificial intelligence business unit, the e-book platform plans to create synergy with an AI-based audio platform to produce more content, including audiobooks.Last year, Seo Young-taek, CEO of Millie’s Library, said if the company’s intellectual property-based business model is well received, its value will exceed the 500 billion won of Radish, the US webtoon platform acquired by Kakao Entertainment. In the long term, the company looks to achieve more than 1 trillion won in value, Seo added.But concerns loom over the e-book platform’s debut amid a lackluster IPO market and an ongoing slump in platform giants such as Naver and Kakao, industry sources said. Naver’s stock price has traded below 300,000 won since late April, while Kakao is also showing sluggish movement between 80,000 and 90,000 won in the citied period.“The company has grown exponentially to become the country’s largest online library platform in just six years. Based on our vision -- ‘become friends with an unlimited number of books’ -- we will expand the presence in the book content market,” Seo said in a statement. Launched in 2017, Millie’s Library services 110,000 e-books through 1,400 publishers as of May. The company is the first here to provide an e-book subscription service. It produces audiobooks, “chat books,” which are books re-created in a chatting format, and audio dramas.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

Hyundai Card headquarters in Seoul (Hyundai Card)Taiwanese banking giant Fubon Financial on Friday raised its stake in South Korea’s Hyundai Card to nearly 20 percent, expanding its clout over management of the card issuer. Fubon Financial is now the card issuer’s third-largest shareholder with 19.98 percent after Hyundai Motor with 36.96 percent and Hyundai Commercial with 28.56 percent. Kia Corp. is the fourth-largest stakeholder with 11.48 percent. The latest announcement puts a final stamp on the exit of a consortium led by Hong Kong-based private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners from the card issuer, which previously owned a 24 percent threshold. Since last year, Affinity had sold its some 20 percent stake to Fubon Financial’s commercial banking unit Fubon Bank and life insurer Fubon Life Insurance for roughly 520 billion won ($409 million). The remaining 4 percent stake was sold to Hyundai Commercial. The move comes four years after the consortium bought the same number of shares for 380 billion won. It also effectively nullifies the Affinity’s initial request made in 2017 for Hyundai Card to complete its initial public offering within four years of the stake purchase, indefinitely delaying the possible listing. “There are no immediate plans for an IPO,” Hyundai Card said in a statement in the day. Early this year, Hyundai Card’s two outside directors from Affinity left their posts to be replaced by Douglas Tsai, management associate at Fubon Financial Holding. The company is expected to fill the vacant post with another Fubon official. “Fubon Financial has highly regarded Hyundai Card’s potential to further grow as a private label credit card issuer alongside our data science and branding skills as our strategic investor,” the card issuer said in a statement. A private label credit card is a credit card that offers more benefits for use at a specific brand‘s stores. Fubon Financial was founded in 1961 with multiple subsidiaries including Fubon Life, Taipei Fubon Bank, Fubon Securities, Fubon Asset Management and more. As of the end of 2021, Fubon Financial Holdings had unaudited net assets of $10.51 trillion. At the end of 2015, Fubon Life purchased a 48 percent stake in Hyundai Life Insurance, to rebrand it as Fubon Hyundai Life.Hyundai Card’s net profit in the first three months of this year declined 4 percent on-year to 76.9 billion won, according to regulatory filing.By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

"AT FIRST glance, Vodafone has nothing to complain about. On September 8th it sold for $6.6 billion the 3.2% stake in China Mobile that it had bought for $3.3 billion between 2000 and 2002. Such a handsome profit ought to be a cue to crack open the champagne and roast some Beijing duck. Yet the British mobile-phone giant did not get what it really wanted: a way into China. In other countries, Vodafone has had a knack of turning a small investment into a controlling stake, but not in the Middle Kingdom. And it is not alone.

Since the late 1990s, several large state-owned Chinese companies have listed their shares. These initial public offerings typically included “cornerstone” investments by big Western firms. For example, BP, Exxon and Shell (three oil firms) and ABB (a Swiss-Swedish conglomerate) took strategic stakes in PetroChina and Sinopec (two big Chinese oil companies). Alcoa, an American aluminium company, invested in Chalco, a Chinese one. And Western banks bought chunks of the leading Chinese state banks when they were listed.

Foreign firms brought several things to the table: capital, technology, management skills and the prospect of better corporate governance. The Chinese press often referred to them as “elder brothers”. In return, these Western firms wanted access to China's huge domestic market.

It did not work out that way. The Chinese state-owned firms did not need capital so badly that they were prepared to cede control to foreigners. Some also found that the Westerners had less to teach them than they had hoped. “Fly-in” expat managers were often unfamiliar with China, says David Michael, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group. Chinese firms tended to learn more from multinationals that had taken the trouble to build their own large sales forces in China, he says.

Chinese firms no longer feel like little brothers. China Mobile now has a market value half as large again as Vodafone's. PetroChina is much bigger than BP. Both Chinese firms are now rich enough to buy whatever expertise they want.

Western energy companies were quick to notice this shift. BP, Shell, ABB and Exxon all sold their holdings in state-owned Chinese firms by 2005. Alcoa got out in 2007. Financial firms followed, in whole or part, during the financial crisis. When China's state-owned Agricultural Bank was recently listed, no big Western bank bought a significant stake.

Western firms grumble about their failure to turn their stakes in China Inc into a foothold in the Chinese market, but not too loudly, so that they do not annoy the government. Besides, thanks to a rising stockmarket, most made sacks of money from their investments.

A few have not yet cashed out. Telefónica, a Spanish telecoms firm, owns 8.8% of China Unicom and politely rebuffs bankers who advise it to sell. AT&T has 25% of a telecoms business in the Pudong district of Shanghai. Despite regulatory problems, it provides a nationwide service from Pudong, largely to multinational clients. It is a nice business, but a far cry from the dreams some Westerners once had about China.",Date,2022-10-13 03:12:36.926202,Even harder than it looks,http://www.economist.com/node/17046627?story_id=17046627&fsrc=rss,"[Vodafone, China Mobile, Vodafone, BP, Exxon, Shell, ABB, Alcoa, the Boston Consulting Group, China Mobile, Vodafone, PetroChina, Shell, ABB, Exxon, Alcoa, Agricultural Bank, China Inc, AT&T]",[]

Trading of shares in Sillajen will resume on the tech-laden KOSDAQ on Thursday, the Korea Exchange (KRX) said, after a review of the biotechnology company's plan to improve its business.  The stock has been suspended since May 2020, after its former executives were charged with embezzlement and breach of trust.   In November 2020, the KRX gave Sillajen a one-year grace period to meet listing requirements. In January this year, however, the bourse operator said the bio firm still did not meet the requirements.   Upon Sillajen's appeal, the KRX granted the firm an additional six-month grace period.   The Sillajen fiasco has drawn an outcry from some 170,000 retail investors.  After its market debut on Dec. 6, 2016, shares in Sillajen rallied to over 150,000 won (US$104.54) in late 2017.   Sillajen tumbled to the 12,000 won level ahead of the trading ban, lower than its IPO price of 15,000 won, and its market capitalization stood at some 1.25 trillion won.

"'Amid chip downturn, SoftBank wants Samsung's financial help for Arm's successful US IPO' By Kim Yoo-chulSoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's plan to meet Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong in Seoul comes just months after the global tech investor dropped plans for the London listing of British chip designer Arm due to the departures of investment minister Gerry Grimstone and digital minister Chris Philp following the resignation of of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Grimstone and Philp played leading roles in talks with SoftBank over the U.K. listing.Son is set to ask the Samsung chief to forge a strategic alliance with Arm, while the Korean chipmaker appears to be somewhat stumped, saying that it has no idea what Son's business proposal could be. Samsung didn't elaborate further. After President Yoon Suk-yeol granted a pardon for the Samsung leader, the company's top executives are increasingly being asked to implement very detailed and applicable business plans to boost shareholder returns amid a slowdown in demand for memory chips.

Senior company executives said that Samsung, which is a leader in the global memory chip industry, is on track to explore acquisition opportunities in order to secure future growth engines.However, despite repeated positive comments by Samsung executives over the progress of its corporate acquisition efforts, several sources familiar with the issues said chances are low that Samsung will pursue a sizable stake in the British chip designer.""First, the departures of the two British ministers mean a lot because they were strong supporters in backing Son's idea for Arm's London initial public offering (IPO).

Son drastically scaled back investments as Vision Fund spent $600 million in new investments in the first quarter of this year down from $20.6 billion in the same period, a year ago.""While Samsung's cash reserves were at some 130 trillion won, as of August this year, it is unlikely for Samsung to serve as a kind of white knight to save SoftBank by purchasing major stakes in Arm because there's no need to do so,"" another executive said on condition of anonymity. The entire value of Arm is estimated at some 95 trillion won, at least. Samsung has acquired 29 companies including seven in the last five years. A total of four acquisitions happened from private equity firms (PEFs). It also divested a total of seven assets. Samsung's largest-ever acquisition was in 2016 when the company bought Harman for $8 billion. It has acquired in seven different U.S. states and nine countries, while the company's most preferred target sectors include software products and software services, according to company disclosures.""Recent failed attempts at blockbuster deal proposals were due to regulatory concerns regarding national security and competition.

""As Samsung's major clients want to build up a consortium for a part of Arm because of antitrust concerns, Samsung may join on this as a gesture to show its backing of industry collaboration,"" said Lee Ju-wan, a researcher at POSCO Research Institute. Earlier, Qualcomm expressed its interest in purchasing a stake in Arm as part of an investment consortium, if necessary, in a way to allay regulatory scrutiny about competition. One key trend seen in the global M&A industry is that there is a lot of pressure from governments on businesses to cooperate. While pursuing a deal via a strategic long-term partnership isn't the classic M&A formula, this would give industries and interested parties more flexibility in terms of tackling common challenges. In 2012, Samsung purchased minor stakes in ASML alongside Intel and TSMC as a financial investor. The stake acquisition did not include voting rights. Four years later, Samsung halved its holdings of ASML to 1.5 percent. Citing the ASML case, market observers say Samsung may review the possibility of acquiring a part of Arm as the chip designer is aiming to push beyond mobile phone technology and deeper into components for next-generation vehicles, data centers, networking equipment and hardware underpinning the metaverse.Arm is strategically important for Samsung. In the chip industry, with major consolidation off the table, industry officials say the small volume of transactions will become the norm, along with increased industry collaboration. Within that context, if Samsung joins the race for a part of Arm with Qualcomm, Apple and Intel, some say there won't be any huge monopoly and/or competition issues.Citing Samsung's strengths in chip manufacturing, Jim Handy, a seasoned chip expert, claimed Samsung's total acquisition of Arm would not raise concerns when considered against the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a measurement of market monopoly that is used to determine market competitiveness. Handy added that because Samsung isn't a processor company, Samsung won't face severe antitrust issues unlike complaints and objections at the time of Arm's attempts to acquire Nvidia.Nonetheless, because Arm's core strengths are based on mobile, buying large chunks is not in Samsung's best interests given its shift toward non-mobile businesses. ""Samsung wants to broaden its key business portfolios for corporate clients and that means avoidance of any conflict of interest with its clients is necessary for Samsung from a profit standpoint. If Arm is acquired by Samsung, then Arm's clients will have greater concerns over technology leaks,"" Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at Eugene Investment, said. Arm generates its profit from licensing and royalty fees paid by its clients including Samsung, Apple and Qualcomm, which use its patented chip designs to produce their own hardware. No powerful synergy effects are expected from Samsung's acquisition of Arm as Samsung aims to become the top foundry chip service provider by 2030, the promising market is currently led by TSMC of Taiwan. ""From Arm's standpoint, it wants to go beyond mobile and this is also true for Samsung; therefore, participating in Arm's U.S. IPO process as a financial investor might make sense for Samsung. But buying even a part of Arm via a consortium is an idea that needs to be developed and reviewed thoroughly,"" said Lee Jong-hwan, a professor of system semiconductor studies at Sangmyung University.

"Softbank-backed unicorn startup says it's in no rush to go publicBy Kim Yoo-chulThe way consumers purchase products has changed drastically over the past few decades, from door-to-door salesmen and billboard ads to digital advertisements.One noticeable trend seen both in the e-commerce and retail industries during the COVID-19 pandemic is the meteoric growth of online consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platforms. As a marketing term, C2C e-commerce is considered a model in which one consumer sells goods or services to other consumers online. It has become one of the four mainstream e-commerce business models today.Despite the pandemic, business-to-consumer (B2C) marketplaces were displaying sound financial performance with Amazon and other top-tier B2C platform operators enjoying revenue and profit growth. However, a lesser known development has been the spectacular rise of C2C marketplaces as the amount of transaction volume, largely involving secondhand products, has soared.""I am a true believer in the power of in-person interactions. Location-based in-person communities offer a chance for people to share their preferred habits, to learn new things, to meet and connect with others who have the same objectives. Danggeun Market is aiming to evolve from a platform for secondhand goods to a trusted facilitator connecting people according to location and communities,"" its co-founder and co-CEO Kim Jae-hyun said in a recent interview at the company's head office in Seocho-dong, southern Seoul.The key responsibility of a facilitator is to build up relevant processes and to create conditions in which parties involved could be satisfied to help them achieve their desired output. Simply put, what a facilitator does is to come up with a plan, then guide and handle various group events to make sure that a group's common purposes are met satisfactorily with a high level of participation, said Kim.By stressing that in-person communities are the core factor behind an improved awareness of brand advocacy, the executive said Danggeun Market is on track to expand its business scope to ensure that its users are functioning well on its mobile platform.Currently, unlike Coupang and Woowa Brothers, which are engaged in commerce and operate a quick-delivery service, Danggeun Market offers accessibility for consumers to fresh local produce delivery and daily-necessity services including cleaning, education and real estate brokerage, all within a four to six-kilometer, cutting costs in the process. ""Danggeun Market is still viewed as an effective tool for secondhand goods. But we are expandable and stretchable as we have a very solid user base. When a company spends continuously in the growth of their community members, their relationship with that company will get much stronger,"" the co-CEO said. Facebook Marketplace, for example, which Danggeun Market believes is its bigggest competitor, has put a higher priority on targeting transactions among people in the same local communities without charging sellers commission fees, because it is dependent upon the profit generated from third-party advertisers attracted to heavy-traffic sites.

Specifically, the company has a greater interest in strengthening its online commerce-driven revenue structure,"" Kim said.Just like representative South Korean startups such Coupang and Krafton, Danggeun Market is ready to expand internationally, further, because of its needs for a bigger market. Its service is currently available in four countries including U.K., the U.S., Canada and Japan. ""We are seeing active monetary transactions in some populated cities of Canada and United Kingdom.

Regarding investors' attention over the company's possible initial public offering (IPO) plan, I would say we have to pick the best IPO timing. An IPO will come later,"" Kim responded.  Money raised from the series of fundraising campaigns will be used for service improvement, business diversification, research projects and investments in machine-learning technology, AI and hiring software developers.  ""Once again, we have to convince investors that money raised is being spent properly and strategically for the growth of the company,"" Kim added.  Investors that participated in the recent fundraising campaign include Yuri Milner's outfit and Aspect Management. Other investors that participated include Altos Ventures and Goodwater Capital. Danggeun Market has become the latest Korean unicorn backed by the venture arm of SoftBank.   Now, the company is focusing more on profitability as it recently decided to collect commissions from companies _ not small merchants and/or users _ for the promotion of their service offerings via Danggeun's web platform. It reported 35.2 billion won in operating losses last year after generating 25.7 billion in revenue.  ""Danggeun Market's local ad sales business is on a growth trajectory. Specifically, the company has a greater interest in strengthening its online commerce-driven revenue structure,"" Kim said.  Just like representative South Korean startups such Coupang and Krafton, Danggeun Market is ready to expand internationally, further, because of its needs for a bigger market. Its service is currently available in four countries including U.K., the U.S., Canada and Japan.   ""We are seeing active monetary transactions in some populated cities of Canada and United Kingdom.

"Life insurer seeks alternative following rejection by KRXBy Anna J. ParkKyobo Life is examining the option of pursuing an overseas listing on the U.S. stock market, as its attempt to go public on the Korean stock market was denied two months ago. According to financial industry sources on Tuesday, the life insurer has begun internal discussions on the topic of going public on the U.S. stock market with a preference for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).It's not the first time that the life insurer has examined the option of an overseas listing. Kyobo Life had also studied and considered going public on other major stock markets, including those of the U.S., Hong Kong, Shanghai and London. Back then, the option was more considered long-term strategic planning for the company's various possible listing scenarios, given that major local financial groups like KB and Shinhan are successfully dual-listed on the Korean and U.S. stock markets. However, market watchers say Kyobo Life's discussions on the overseas listing this time around seem to be more related to seeking an alternative breakthrough for the firm's growth, as the company's listing efforts on the Korean stock market had met a major obstacle. The company's application for a preliminary round of IPO assessment earlier this year at the Korea Exchange (KRX), the operator of local bourse markets, was turned down in July due to ongoing legal disputes among the firm's major shareholders. Kyobo Life has been mired in years-long legal disputes with its financial investors, including Hong Kong-based Affinity Equity Partners, both at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and in local courts over issues related to the financial investors' right to exercise their put options. Although the KRX does not publicly announce reasons for turning down a company's IPO application, market watchers view that the unending legal disputes among shareholders played a key role in the KRX's decision not to allow the life insurer's listing on the local stock market. It is the first case in the past three years that the KRX declined to give the green light to a company that applied for the preliminary IPO assessment to go public on the country's main benchmark KOSPI market. Regarding the possibility of pursing a listing on the U.S. stock market, Kyobo Life responded that nothing is set for the time being, while acknowledging that the overseas listing has been mulled over as one option among the firm's possible future moves.

"Oil prices rose yesterday morning, for the fifth consecutive day, and Brent reached its highest level since October 2018, and is heading towards $80 a barrel, amid concerns about supply, at a time when demand is increasing in some regions of the world with the easing of measures to combat the Corona pandemic. Brent crude rose $1.15, or 1.5 percent, to $79.24 a barrel, after it recorded its third consecutive weekly increase last week. US crude rose $1.07, or 1.5 percent, to $75.05 a barrel, which is near its highest price since July, after recording its fifth consecutive weekly increase last week. Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for the price of Brent crude by the end of the year by ten dollars to $ 90 a barrel due to the recovery of fuel demand at a faster than expected rate from the repercussions of the spread of the delta mutated from the Corona virus and the impact of Hurricane “Ida” on American production, which led to a decrease in global supplies. Goldman Sachs said: “We have long had a positive outlook for oil prices, but the deficit between supply and demand is currently larger than our expectations with global demand recovering from the impact of the delta shift faster than our previous unanimous expectations and with global supplies remaining at levels lower than our previous expectations.” The recovery in demand surprised the member countries of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, the group known as “OPEC +”, and they faced difficulties in raising production with the continued lack of investments and the postponement of maintenance work due to the pandemic.

"Yesterday, Saudi Aramco announced a decrease in net profit in the first quarter of the year by 25%, which is less than analysts' estimates, but the quarterly cash dividend is in line with a payment plan of $75 billion to shareholders for the current year. Analysts expected that Aramco, whose shares were floated on the stock exchange last year, would keep dividends to minority shareholders, while reducing dividends to the Saudi government, whose financial conditions were affected by the drop in oil prices amid the Corona pandemic. Brent crude prices fell 65.6 percent in the first quarter, before OPEC + producers agreed to cut supplies by a record size of 9.7 million barrels per day, starting in May, to help raise prices and curb oversupply.

Aramco said that the first quarter dividends are ""the highest among all listed companies in the world."" But Aramco has not made any announcement regarding the future of the dividend policy. Youssef Hosseini, an analyst at EFG Hermes, stated that there will be no change in the dividend policy in the first quarter, but he still expects to reduce the government's share, which is the largest shareholder, from the distributions. He continued, ""The government's share will be reduced in the second quarter, but there is some optimism if it renegotiates the SABIC deal, which may provide some cash flow."" Aramco said earlier that its planned acquisition of a 70 percent stake in SABIC was moving towards completion in the second quarter.
