17/Jul/2022 00:00:00,18/Jul/2022 12:11:17, Different Stripe Fintech Success Story Enters Choppy Waters,"When Stripe Closed Its Latest Funding Round Early Last Year, It Had Much To Celebrate, Not Least Its New Valuation Of 95Bn 95 3Bn It Made The 12 Year Old Company One Of The Most Valuable Privately Held Tech Companies In The World While It Boasted Of Processing 640Bn Worth Of Payments A Year The Company, Founded By Limerick Brothers Patrick And John Collison, Is Truly A Global Success Story, Feted By Investors And Customers Alike Stripe Seemingly Could Do No Wrong But A Series Of Bumps In The Road In Recent Months Have Challenged Stripe S Standing, Whether It Is Allegations Of Impropriety By Rivals Or Discontent Among Some Workers This Is Against A Backdrop Of An Intensifying Economic Downturn Which All Fintech And Payments Companies Are Feeling Fintech Has Experienced The Wrath Of The Stock Market Slump, Which Has Bled Into The Private Markets, According To Investment Analysis Firm Pitchbook In A Recent Report It Flagged Stripe As One Of The Late Stage Payments And Fintech Companies Likely To Be Affected By Public Market Valuation Re Ratings Then On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal Reported That The Company Had Cut The Internal Value Of Its Shares By 28Pc According To The Report, The Company Told Employees In An Email That Its Internal Share Price Was About 29, Compared With 40 In The Previous Internal Valuation Other Large Privately Held Fintech Companies Have Suffered Falling Valuations Of Late Klarna, The Swedish Buy Now Pay Later Player, Closed A Funding Round This Week Of 800M That Valued It At 6 7Bn, A Staggering Decline From The 45 6Bn Price Tag It Had A Year Ago Stripe Had Not Been Immune From Value Markdowns In Recent Months Either Fidelity Investments, One Of The Company S High Profile Backers, Twice Marked Down The Value Of Its Shares In The Collisons S Company From 41 81 Per Share At The Start Of The Year To 27 15 In May The Big Question Will Be What Happens If Stripe Tries To Raise Money Again In The Next 12 To 18 Months Robert Le, Senior Analyst At Pitchbook, Told The Sunday Independent He Remained Reasonably Positive About Stripe S Potential Valuation Into The Future However, Much Depends On Whether Or Not It Needs To Raise Funds During This Turbulent Time For Tech Stocks The Valuation Was Really High But They Can Grow Into That Valuation As Long As They Continue To Find Some Growth Over The Next 18 Months If They Don T Need To Raise A Round, They Ll Be Fine, Le Said If They Are Burning A Lot Of Cash My Understanding Is That They Re Not, But If They Are Or For Some Reason They Have A Shorter Runway And They Have To Raise A Round Over The Next 12 To 18 Months, Then It Would Be Very Likely There Will Be A Down Round And They Will Get A Valuation Cut The Atmosphere For Raising Money, Whether It Is Start Ups Or Later Stage Giants Like Stripe, Will Be A Much Colder One In The Environment Of Inflation, High Interest Rates And Cost Cutting Read The Leading Stories From The World Of Business Enter Email Addressthis Field Is Requiredsign Up At The Onset Of The Pandemic, Fears Swirled About Tech Companies Ability To Raise Capital But The Opposite Proved True, With Venture Capital Investors Deploying Massive Cheques In 2020 And 2021 Le Said Those Heady Days Are Over Now We Re Not Going To See That Environment In Tech Valuations Anymore, So I Think There S Going To Be A Reset Where We Re Moving Back Towards The Mean, He Said You Re Going To Start Seeing, Over The Next Six To 12 Months, A Lot Of Down Rounds Stripe Has Been Ploughing Ahead With New Products Many Of Which Are Developed At Its Emea Headquarters In Dublin And Has Successfully Diversified Its Product Portfolio Beyond Its Core Of Payment Processing, With Services In Tax, Compliance And Open Banking Its Fierce Expansion Has, However, Brought Criticisms Of Late, Namely From Rivals The Chief Executive Of Plaid, The Us Open Banking Fintech Firm, Accused Stripe In A Now Deleted Tweet Of Impropriety In Launching A Product Similar To Plaid S, Claiming Information Was Obtained Through Interviews For A Role At Plaid In January Ryan Breslow, The Founder Of Bolt, Another Payments Processor, Accused Stripe Of Running A Monopoly That Walled Out Other Fintech Start Ups From Raising Money Speaking At A Conference In Amsterdam Last Month, Stripe S John Collison Hit Back At The Allegations And Said That The Company Was Pretty Unapologetic About Its Product Expansion And Moving Into Other Areas Where Competitors Play Sometimes We Launch A Product First And Then Other People Come Along And Develop Competitors To That, Collison Said Sometimes There Will Be Someone Else In The Market With A Product Like Plaid, And Then We Will Enter A Space With A Similar Product But With Pure Differentiation For Customers Close John Collison, President At Stripe Photo Conor Mccabe Philip Benton, A Fintech Analyst At Market Research Firm Omdia, Said That These Conflicts Are To Be Expected For Any Company That Grows To The Size That Stripe Has That S Only Natural The Bigger You Get There S More Criticism And People Are Going To Accuse You Of Having A Monopoly And So Forth Benton Said That Stripe Venturing Into A Nascent Area Like Open Banking, Where Plaid Exists, Is An Acknowledgment That There Is A Future In It Open Banking, Which Refers To The Sharing And Use Of Financial Data Across Various Applications, Has Seen A Swathe Of Start Ups Emerge In The Last Several Years If There S A Big Opportunity In Open Banking, It Would Be Naive Of Plaid To Think That Stripe Wouldn T Want To Be Involved, And Actually It S Almost A Testament That You Re In The Right Industry If Someone Like Stripe Is Looking To Compete With You, Benton Said I Don T Think They Re Necessarily Ripping Off People S Products It S Just They Used To Be More Of A First Mover, Because They Were Smaller, Whereas Now They Re More Of A Fast Follower In Terms Of The Products That They Re Bringing Out The Criticism Is Not Just External Though Stripe Employs More Than 8,000 People Across More Than 20 Offices Internationally Last Month Tech News Outlet The Information Reported That There Was Disquiet Among The Ranks Of The Company Over Bonus Pay Some Staff, It Reported, Were Entitled To Receive Their Annual Bonuses In The Form Of Equity, Which Could Prove To Be A Hot Ticket Some Day However, At The Time, The Company S Sales Staff Would Not Be Eligible For Equity Based Bonuses, Leading To Frustration Among The Sales Division And How They Are Viewed Compared To Other Divisions In The Company It Is Understood That Since The Report The Company Has Made Changes To Its Bonus Programme For Sales Staff To Receive Equity A Spokeswoman For Stripe Declined To Comment On The Complaints Made By Staff Most Notably, Stripe Is One Of The Few Major Fintech Companies That Has Not Been Cutting Staff In Recent Months Whereas Coinbase, Klarna And Robinhood Have All Been Shedding Employees To Rein In Their Overheads However, The Matter Of Employee Equity In Stripe And Who Gets It Could Become Tense As Speculation Around A Stock Market Flotation Arises It Is An Issue That Bubbles Up Frequently As Investors And Analysts Try To Figure Out What The Irish Brothers Long Term Gameplan Is Stripe Is 12 Years Old And Has Now Raised Over 2Bn Across Several Funding Rounds This Means Most Investors Are Waiting Patiently For A Return On Their Investment The Collisons Have Typically Been Sheepish About Committing To A Timeline For An Ipo But Have Never Ruled Out A Stock Market Debut In The Frothy Days Of 2020 And 2021 Where It Seemed Fintech Companies Could Only Go Up, There Were A Slew Of Ipos Or Stock Market Listings Via Blank Cheque Firms Called Spacs Coinbase, The Cryptocurrency Exchange, Was Among Them, First Floating Last Year With An 86Bn Market Cap But Now Has A 11Bn Valuation, Thanks In Large Part To The Recent Crash In Crypto Values The Mood Music On The Public Markets Has Changed For Now However, An Ipo Is Not Something That The Collisons Can Put On The Long Finger Forever It Depends On Their Runway In Terms Of Cash And Funding, How Much Can They Afford To Wait I Think They Re Too Big To Be Acquired By Anyone Right Now So The Ipo Seems Like The Natural Route For Them But They Ve Always Been A Little Bit Coy About When That Would Be, Benton Said It S Probably Sensible Not To Ipo Now If You Can Wait But I Would Definitely Expect It To Happen In The Next Couple Of Years Irrespective Pitchbook S Le Said He Expects 2024 To Be The Earliest Possible Time For Going Public, Just Based On What S Going On In The Ipo Markets, What S Going On In The Macro Environment Should Stripe Weather The Next Year Or So Of Economic Uncertainty Relatively Unscathed, It Could Face Renewed Questions About Going Public I Think Eventually They Have To They Raised Their First Venture Funding In 2011, So It S Been 11

Add A Capacity Of 600 Mt Per Day Mulyadi Added That Currently The Total Production Capacity Through Hfm Is 1,600 Mt Per Day, With Utilization Reaching 90% Thus, Trgu S Production Capacity Will Reach 2,200 Mt Per Day In Order To Leverage Sales Performance, This Issuer Is Also Committed To Maintaining The Quality Of Its Products In Addition, Said Mulyadi, The Company Will Also Diversify Products

Mulyadi Hopes That Trgu Will Be Able To Achieve Performance Growth This Year Unfortunately, He Has Not Been Able To Convey The Details Of The 2022 Performance Target, In Line With The Current Unstable

18/Jul/2022 00:00:00,18/Jul/2022 12:11:17,How Wall Street Banks Made A Killing On Spac Craze,"New York Investment Banks Have Raked In Billions Of Dollars By Feeding The Frenzy For Blank Check Companies, And They Have Done So Largely Without Risking Any Of Their Own Money On Hundreds Of Deals That Have Left Many Investors With Punishing Losses A Look At One Of These Deals Shows How In Late 2020, Acies Acquisition Corp Tapped Into Investor Demand For Blank Check Companies Formally Known As Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, Or Spacs With An Initial Public Offering That Raised 215 Million Among The Investment Banks Acies Signed Up To Underwrite The Ipo Were Jpmorgan Chase Co, Morgan Stanley And Oppenheimer Co When The Offering Closed, Acies, Essentially A Shell Company, Followed The Spac Template With The Cash It Had Raised, It Had Two Years To Find And Merge With A Private Company Seeking A Stock Market Listing, Or Return The Money To Investors Acies Management Team Announced It Was On The Hunt For A Business In The Experiential Entertainment Industry The Team Didn T Have To Look For Very Long Hours After The Ipo Closed, Bankers Advising Playstudios Inc Contacted Acies Managers To Tell Them The Las Vegas Based Maker Of Mobile Casino Games Was For Sale, Regulatory Filings Show Those Bankers Were Also With Jpmorgan In Early 2021, The Two Companies Announced Plans For A Merger That Valued Playstudios At 1 1 Billion In The Run Up To The Merger And The Listing Of The Combined Company S Shares, Playstudios Touted A Rosy Future It Forecast That Surging Ad Sales, A New Role Playing Game And Cross Marketing Offerings To Game Players Would Bring A 20% Rise In Revenue In 2021 And A 33% Jump This Year Since Then, The Company Has Scrapped The New Game, And Revenue Fell Far Short Of Predictions Retail Investors Suffered The Consequences The Stock Is Down More Than 50% Since Shareholders Approved The Merger Last June Playstudios Is One That Looks Like Crap Right Now, Dan Ushman, A 37 Year Old Chicago Area Entrepreneur, Said Earlier This Year He Put About 26,000 Into Acies After It Announced Its Deal With Playstudios And Soon Saw His Investment Drop More Than 35% Investment Banks Involved In The Deal Fared Much Better, Having Risked None Of Their Own Money, Based On A Reuters Review Of Regulatory Filings Jpmorgan, In Particular, Pocketed Hefty Fees For Its Dual Role As An Underwriter For The Acies Ipo And As An Adviser To Playstudios Perfectly Legal, Despite The Apparent Conflict Of Interest, If The Bank Discloses Its Role, As Jpmorgan Did The Bank Has Not Disclosed Its Fees, But Financial Data Provider Refinitiv Estimates That Jpmorgan Earned 4 7 Million In Underwriting Fees And 14 2 Million As A Sell Side Adviser It Also Received 1 6 Million For Helping Acies Raise Additional Capital Through A Maneuver Known As Private Investment In Public Equity, Or Pipe, According To Financial Research Firm Morningstar Inc And A Reuters Analysis Pipes, Which Tap Big Institutional Investors, Are Often Necessary To Close A Spac Merger Morgan Stanley Earned About 5 9 Million And Oppenheimer About 1 2 Million In Underwriting Fees, According To Refinitiv Estimates Each Bank Also Got About 1 6 Million In Pipe Related Fees, According To Morningstar And A Reuters Analysis Liontree Advisors, Another Playstudios Adviser, Earned 6 2 Million On The Deal, According To Refinitiv Estimates, Plus 1 6 Million In Pipe Fees, According To Morningstar And A Reuters Analysis Jp Morgan, Morgan Stanley And Liontree Declined To Comment An Oppenheimer Spokesman Said The Bank Had A Minor Role In The Acies Ipo Playstudios Noted That The Jpmorgan Teams It And Acies Worked With Came From Separate Divisions Of The Bank The Company Said It Has A Robust Framework For Evaluating, Approving, Executing And Optimizing Its Game Initiatives, And That It Is Continually Revisiting The Conditions And Decision To Either Advance Or Suspend An Initiative A Curious Pattern The Disparate Outcomes Of The Acies Playstudios Deal Big Bucks For The Investment Banks That Sold It And Big Losses For Retail Investors Who Bought Into It Are Typical Of Many Spac Deals For This Article, Reuters Analyzed Hundreds Of Spacs Spanning Roughly Two Years, Reviewed Banks Internal Documents And Regulatory Filings, And Interviewed More Than Two Dozen Bankers, Investors, Spac Managers, Lawyers And Corporate Executives The Examination Found That Investment Banks Turbocharged To Their Benefit What Turned Out To Be A Speculative Bubble In Companies That Have Often Failed To Live Up To Their Pre Listing Hype The Spac Market Has Sagged Since The Collapse Of Some High Profile Blank Check Listings Amid Overall Grim Market Conditions And In March, The U S Securities And Exchange Commission Sec Proposed New Rules That Would Increase Disclosure Requirements And Potential Legal Liability For Spacs And Their Banks Facing These Market And Regulatory Challenges, Some Banks Have Been Pulling Back From The Business Whatever Happens To The Spac Market, The Reuters Examination Reveals In Detail For The First Time How, Over The Past Couple Of Years, Wall Street Banks Have Enriched Themselves By Aggressively Promoting The Deals In The Absence Of The Legal Guardrails And Financial Risks Associated With Traditional Ipos Credit Suisse Summed It Up Last Year In A Confidential Client Presentation Reviewed By Reuters Spacs Bend The Rules Of The Ipo Market The Swiss Bank Has Had A Role In 136 Blank Check Deals Since The Beginning Of 2020 Through The End Of March, According To A Reuters Analysis Of Spac Research Data A Credit Suisse Spokesperson Said The Language In The Presentation Pertains To Spac Market Conventions That Give Companies And Investors More Flexibility Than In Traditional Ipos The Bank Is Committed To Recommending Strategies That Conform To All Applicable Rules, The Spokesperson Said In A Traditional Ipo, Underwriters Can Be Held Responsible Under Securities Law For Any Misleading Forecasts, Projections Or Other Statements Made To Investors To Protect Themselves Against Liability, Banks Perform Rigorous Due Diligence On Companies Whose Ipos They Underwrite, And Those Companies Generally Do Not Issue Public Forecasts About Their Performance Banks Also Buy Big Chunks Of An Issuing Company S New Shares, Risking Losses If They Can T Resell The Stock For More Than They Paid With A Spac, A Bank S Role As Underwriter Ends Once The Blank Check Company Completes Its Ipo, But The Bank Receives A Portion Of Its Fee Only After The Spac Makes An Acquisition By The Time The Spac Announces A Merger, Spac Underwriters Aren T Responsible For Forecasts And Other Claims About The Performance Of The Company To Be Acquired And Publicly Listed And Because Blank Check Ipos Are Typically Priced At A Nominal 10, Banks Do Not Run The Risk Of Having To Sell New Shares That Fall In Value For Investment Banks, Blank Check Deals Create Moral Hazard An Incentive To Take On Risk Because Of Little Exposure To It According To Usha Rodrigues, A Law Professor At The University Of Georgia Who Studies Spacs That S Because They Don T Have The Same Liability With A Spac That They Have With A Traditional Ipo, But Banks Do Get To Collect Fees If They Can Get A Deal Done, She Said The Companies That Merged With Spacs Don T Have The Same Level Of Vetting, Which Most Retail Investors Do Not Realize Shares Of Companies That Obtained A Stock Market Listing In A Spac Merger From 2019 Through The Beginning Of March Were Down Roughly 36% On Average From When Their Deals Closed, According To Data Provided By Jay Ritter, A Professor Of Finance At The University Of Florida That S Even Worse Than The 14% Decline In Shares Of Companies That Went Public Through Traditional Ipos During The Same Period, According To Nasdaq Inc All Told, According To Vanda Research, Retail Investors Lost 4 8 Billion, Or 23%, Of The Aggregate 21 3 Billion They Plowed Into Spacs From The Beginning Of 2020 To The First Week Of April 2022 Yet The Deals That Brought Those Shares To Market Have Yielded A Bonanza For Investment Banks Industry Tracker Coalition Greenwich Estimates That Banks Booked About 8 Billion In Spac Related Fees In 2020 And 2021 That Represents Roughly 6 5% Of Total U S Investment Banking Fees That Major Banks Collected In That Period, According To Coalition Greenwich The Bank Has An Incentive To Push The Deal To Get Closed, At Any Price, Because They Want Their 3 5% Of The Spac Ipo Proceeds, Said Mike Stegemoller, A Professor Of Banking And Finance At Baylor University, Referring To The Fees Underwriters Receive Only After A Spac Merger Closes I Think The Conflict Is With Retail Investors Who Are Buying Common Shares Of Stock Do You Really Think Banks Care About These Retail Investors I Think There Are Good Incentives Not To Many Banks Amped Up Their Take By Working For Both Sides Of Deals, As Jpmorgan Did With Acies And Playstudios Reuters Identified Roughly 50 Such Cases From Early 2020 To November 2021 Soured Sentiment As The Spac Bubble Has Deflated, Debate Over Responsibility For Investor Losses Has Focused On The Executives Of Blank Check Companies These Founding Investors Referred To As Sponsors Risk Losing All Of Their Investment If They Can T Find A Company To Take Public Through A Merger Within The Two Year Window However, Founders Acquire Their Shares At Deep Discounts To The Typical 10 Offering Price, Thanks To Preferential Treatment And Fees That Can Dilute Retail Investors Holdings Likewise, The Hedge Funds And Other Institutional Investors That Account For A Lot Of The Money Behind Spacs Often Obtain Their Shares In An Ipo Or Subsequent Pipe Under Favorable Terms That Put Them At An Advantage Relative To Retail Investors The Sec Put Spacs On Notice Last Year With Several Enforcement Actions Against Specific Companies And Their Sponsors For Allegedly Misleading Investors About Their Prospects Then, In Late March, The Regulator Announced Its Proposed Rules, Which Would, Among Other Things, Establish That Investment Banks That Underwrite Spacs Could Be Held Legally Liable For False Or Misleading Forecasts Or Statements About Blank Check Deals The Sec Will Vote On The Rules After The Public Comment Period Ends Later This Spring The Sec Declined To Comment In A March 30 Statement On The Proposed Rules, Sec Chair Gary Gensler Said Gatekeepers Such As Underwriters Should Have To Stand Behind And Be Responsible For Basic Aspects Of Their Work And Provide An Essential Function To Police Fraud And Ensure The Accuracy Of Disclosure To Investors In Its Proposed Rules, The Sec Said That The Fees Underwriting Banks Receive When A Spac Closes A Deal Could Indicate Participation In The Merger, And That Banks Also Have A Strong Financial Interest In Making Sure A Spac Inks A Deal For These Reasons, The Regulator Said, It Is Proposing Increasing Banks Liability To Date, Investors Have Not Sought To Hold Major Wall Street Banks Responsible For False Or Misleading Information Alleged In Any Of The 47 Spac Related Class Action Shareholder Lawsuits Filed Since 2021, According To A Reuters Analysis Of A Public Database Maintained By Stanford Law School And Attorney Kevin Lacroix, Who Follows The Cases None Of Those Cases Have Yet Succeeded In Court One Aspect Of Spacs That Has Already Drawn Regulatory Scrutiny Is Undisclosed Dealings Between Blank Check Companies And Their Targets Before A Merger Is Announced That S Because Investors Could Be Misled If A Spac Privately Shakes Hands With An Acquisition Target While Publicly Stating It Is Still Seeking The Best Possible Merger Partner Communications Between A Spac And Its Acquisition Target Are Part Of An Sec Investigation Of Former U S President Donald Trump S 1 25 Billion Deal, Announced Last October, To List His New Social Media Venture On The Stock Market In A December Filing, Digital World Acquisition Corp, The Spac That Is Merging With The Former President S Trump Media Technology Group, Disclosed That The Sec Had Asked For Documents Relating To Communications Between Digital World And Trump Media And Meetings Of Digital World S Board, Among Other Things The Sec Stated In Its Request That Its Investigation Did Not Mean The Agency Had Concluded That Anyone Violated The Law, Digital World Said Trump Media Has Since Launched The Truth Social Platform To Lackluster Effect Trump Media And Digital World Acquisition Corp Did Not Respond To Requests For Comment The Sec Declined To Comment In The Acies Playstudios Deal, Pre Existing Relationships Raise The Question Of Whether The Two Companies Already Had A Merger In Mind, Potentially Precluding Better Deals For Investors Acies Told Investors When It Launched Its Ipo That It Had Not Identified A Company To Merge With And That It Would Pursue The Best Opportunity It Could Find However, Andrew Pascal, Chief Executive Officer Of Playstudios, Co Founded Acies With Jim Murren, Who Was Chief Executive Officer Of Mgm Resorts Inc When That Casino Operator Invested In Playstudios, As Was Disclosed In A Securities Filing Playstudios Said It Considered All Viable Spac Proposals And Eventually Made The Decision It Believed Was The Best Of The Available Options For The Company Responding To Reuters Inquiries On Behalf Of Murren And Pascal, Playstudios Noted That Mgm Resorts, Not Murren Personally, Invested In The Company, And That Pascal Recused Himself From All Acies Deliberations Concerning Playstudios Once Talks Began And Forfeited His Economic Interest In Acies To Avoid Even The Appearance Of Having Conflicting Interests Backwater To Bonanza For Decades, Spacs Were A Backwater Of Wall Street, Connecting Speculators With Companies That Had No Other Means Of Going Public That Changed In Late 2019 And Early 2020, When Shares Of Richard Branson S Spaceflight Provider Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc And Sports Betting Operator Draftkings Inc Surged More Than 600% After Going Public Through Spac Mergers Investors Stuck At Home During The Covid 19 Pandemic And Flush With Cash From Government Stimulus Payments Helped Drive Those Gains, And They Clamored For More Wall Street Banks Were Happy To Oblige And Began Aggressively Promoting The Business In Client Presentations And Other Documents Reviewed By Reuters, They Repeatedly Acknowledged The Tainted Reputation Of Spacs And Boasted Of Their Ability To Bring Quality Companies To Market Through Blank Check Deals In A 2020 Presentation, Morgan Stanley Said There Was A Historical Perception Of Lower Quality Companies Picking The Spac Route, Although Views Have Improved Somewhat For Its Part, Morgan Stanley Said It Associated Only With The Highest Quality Partners Some Of Its Past Partners Include Acies, The Spac That Brought Playstudios To Market Shares Of The 51 Companies That Morgan Stanley Has Helped Take Public Through Spacs Either As An Adviser Or By Raising Money To Close The Deal Since The Beginning Of 2020 Were Down 28% On Average Through Late March, According To A Reuters Analysis Morgan Stanley Declined To Comment On The Presentation And The Performance Of Shares In Companies That Went Public Through Its Spacs Citigroup, In A 2019 Presentation, Said That While Spacs Historically Had Been Considered A Four Letter Word, Synonymous With Poor Outcomes, That Perception Was Changing As Investors Appetite For New Alternatives Grew Companies That Citi Helped Bring To Market Through Spacs

Citi Was An Underwriter For The Ipo Of A Spac Called Spartan Acquisition Corp Ii And An Adviser To The Company Spartan Subsequently Acquired, Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc, A Financier Of Solar Energy Systems The Bank Helped Spartan Determine Its Valuation Of Sunlight At 1 3 Billion, Based On Sunlight S Own Profit Estimates, Securities Filings Show Sunlight Later Slashed Its Profit Estimates

Of The Bank S Internal Approval Process When Working For A Company That Could Merge With A Spac, The Bank Evaluates Alternatives And Helps Identify The Most Suitable Course Of Action, Regardless Of Whether Credit Suisse Underwrote The Blank Check Firm S Ipo, The Spokesperson Said Virgin Galactic Declined To Comment Another Company Credit Suisse Helped Bring To Market Is Paysafe Ltd The Online

18/Jul/2022 00:00:00,18/Jul/2022 12:11:17,How Covid Propelled Trillion Dollar Valuations," A Billion Here, A Billion There, And Pretty Soon You Re Talking Real Money, The Late Us Senator Everett Dirksen Once Said, Mainly With Reference To Out Of Control Federal Spending In America It Was A Snarky Understatement To Emphasise Not Just Wasteful Government Spending, But Also The Value Of A Billion Dollars, Which, Expressed Numerically, Is 1 Followed By Nine Zeroes As In, Us 1,000,000,000 Although The World S First Billion Dollar Company Us Steel Announced Itself In 1901, And The World S First Billionaire John Rockefeller Of Standard Oil Was Minted In 1916, Even In The 1950S, When Dirksen Was Said To Have Made The Comment, A Billion Was Big, Big Bucks Today, A Billion Dollars Or Even A Million Dollars For That Matter Is Still A Lot Of Money For An Individual There Are Approximately 2,800 Known Billionaires And Many Unknown In The World, A List Currently Led By Tesla S Elon Musk, With An Estimated Wealth Of 280Bln But In Corporate Terms, It Is Becoming Chump Change Companies Founded On A Whim And Prayer, Or An App And Hope, Acquire Valuation Of A Billion Dollars In Quick Time, Often Based On Speculative Hope And Hype In An Era Of Easy Come Easy Go, Some Endure, Many Do Not Dubbed Unicorns, A Term First Popularised By Venture Capitalist Aileen Lee After The Mythical Animal To Represent The Statistical Rarity Of Such Successful Ventures, They Have Become A Fairly Common Measure Of Entrepreneurial Fizz In 2013, When The Term Was First Used To Describe Startups That Scaled Up Quickly To A Billion Dollars, There Were Less Than 40 Unicorns, Mainly In The Us Today, There Are An Estimated 1,000 Unicorns Across The World, Including 300 In China And 100 In India Some 30 Unicorns, Including Already Famous Names Such As Spacex, Instacart, Stripe, And Bytedance, Each Valued Between 10Bln And 100Bln, Have Been Given The Name Decacorn Scaling Further Up, Decacorns Become Hectocorns When They Are Valued At Over 100Bln Up Until This Stage, Unicorns, Decacorns, And Hectocorns Are Startup Companies That Are Private, Venture Backed Entities, Recognised And Evaluated For Their Potential For Growth, And Not On Their Financial Performance Riding On Get Big Fast Gbf Strategies, Also Known As Blitzscaling, These Startups Try To Expand At A High Rate Through Large Funding Rounds And Price Cutting To Gain An Advantage On Market Share And Overrun Competitors As Quickly As Possible In Pursuit Of This Foothold Or Market Share, Many Of Them Don T Make A Dime In Profit Instead, They Burn Money To Get Ahead Facebook Was The First Decacorn And Hectocorn In History, Crossing A 100Bln Valuation Before It Went Public Once They Go Public With An Ipo, They No Longer Qualify For The Informal Corn Suffix It Was Followed By China S Alibaba Bytedance, Owners Of The App Tiktok, Which Is Backed By Investors Such As Sequoia Capital China And Softbank Group Among Others, Is A Current Decacorn, Valued At Over 140Bln More Than The Current Market Cap Of Storied Companies Such As At T And American Express Since Facebook Became The First Privately Held Decacorn Turned Hectocorn, A 100Bln Plus Privately Held Company, An Additional 84 Decacorns Have Been Created Not All Have Survived, With 33 Of Them Losing Their Status For Various Reasons This Leaves 51 Companies Still Straining At The Leash To Go Public, Whereupon They Enter New Terrain They Include Names Such As India S Byju S, Currently Valued At 21Bln, Making It The World S Most Valuable Education Technology Startup, And China S Yuanfudao, Also An Edtech Startup Valued At 15 5Bln While Unicorns And Decacorns Grow Through Large Funding Rounds From Private Venture Capital Firms And Investors To Get An Early Foothold In The Marketplace, Sitting On Top Of The Pyramid Are Companies That Do Go Public And Scale A Stratospheric Height Of A Trillion Dollars Companies For Which There Is Still No Agreed Upon Term As Yet The Name Pegasus Has Been Suggested For Such Companies Which Reach The New Valuation Pinnacle Of 1Trln Like The Unicorn, The Pegasus Is Also A Mythical Horse, But With Wind Beneath Its Wings Collectively, They Are Simply Known As Big Tech They Are The T Company The Market Cap Of 1Trln A Trillion Is No Trifling Sum For Starters, It Is 1 Followed By 12 Zeroes As In 1,000,000,000,000 A Trillion Dollars Is Greater Than The Gross Domestic Product Gdp Of All But A Score Of Countries It Is Greater Than The Gdp Of Switzerland, Sweden And Argentina, Each With Gdp Below One Trillion Dollars In Nominal Terms For That Matter, The Valuation Of Apple, Which Recently Crossed 3Trln It Has Since Dropped To About 2 65Trln At The Time Of Writing , Nudged The Gdp Of Great Britain And India, Two Of The Larger Economies Of The World Today, There Are Around Half A Dozen Companies In The World That Have A Market Cap Of Over 1Trln All But Saudi Aramco Are Us Born And Us Based, And Each Has A Tech Orientation As Of March 31, 2022, They Are Led By Apple 2 85Trln , Followed By Microsoft 2 31Trln , Alphabet Google 1 84Trln , Amazon 1 65Trln , And, The Most Recent Addition To The List, Tesla 1 1Trln Couple Others Have Crossed The 1 T Mark Or Nibbled At It And Receded Notably Petrochina And Meta Facebook The Rise, Rise, And Rise Of Us Tech Companies Has Also Led To Growing Concerns About Big Tech An Analogous Recall Of Market Dominance By A Few Companies In Other Market Sectors Such As Big Oil And Big Pharma For Instance, The Big Five Tech Stocks, Originally Dubbed Faamg Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, And Google And Now Taamg With Tesla Replacing Facebook, Which Has Lost Nearly 30 Per Cent Of Its Valuation , Account For About A Quarter Of The Market Capitalisation Of The Entire 500 Companies In Standard Poor S 500 This Effectively Means 1% Of The Companies In The Index Account For About 25% Of The Total Market Value Such Market Concentration Isn T Unusual In Fact, Some Companies In The Past Represented An Even Bigger Share Of The Market Back In 1932, At T Accounted For 13% Of Total Us Stock Market Value, More Than Twice Apple S Approximately 6% Share Of The Current S P Value About 40 Trillion Even Further Back, In 1928, General Motors Represented 8% Of The Market, And, In 1970, Ibm 7% But There Is A Big Difference In The Time And Pace Of How The Modern Big Tech Became Bellwethers While Four Of The Five American Companies Hit The 1Trln Market Cap Before The Pandemic, What Is Remarkable Is That The Onset Of Covid 19 Which Lowered The Boom On Many Traditional Legacy Companies Powered Big Tech To Even Greater Heights For Instance, Apple, Which Hit 1Trln Market Cap On August 2, 2018, Doubled That In Just Two Years, Going Up To 2Trln On August 19, 2020, In The Middle Of The Pandemic It Took Even Less Time To Breach 3Trln On January 3, 2022 Before Receding Slightly Similarly, Microsoft Went From Breaching 1 Trillion In June 2019 To Surpassing 2Trln In June 2021, And Google Went From Scaling 1 T In January 2020 To Topping 2 T In November 2021 So, What Gives How And Why Did This Happen, Particularly During A Pandemic The Pandemic And The Online Giants To Begin With, Even In The Pre Pandemic Economy, Four Members Of The Trillion Dollar Club Tesla Came Late To The Party Dominated Their Respective Market Apple In Smartphones, Microsoft In Cloud Computing, Alphabet Google In Internet Advertising, And Amazon In Online Retail When The Pandemic Kicked In, The Stay Work And Buy From Home Economy Brought Rich Rewards To These Companies While The Already Besieged Brick And Mortar Companies Collapsed, The Online Giants Boomed, Helped In Addition By Stimulus Payments That Put Money In People S Pockets On Top Of Low Interest Rates Apple And Microsoft Sales Of It Products And Cloud Services Soared, As Did Amazon Retailing And Google Services, As People Spent More And More Time Indoors And Online In Many Ways, The Pandemic Helped Clarify A Trend That Was Already Becoming Apparent Before Covid 19 Struck Rewind Or Flashback 25 Years, And You Will See That The Top 10 Companies In Terms Of Market Cap Were A Mix Of Oil, Food, Pharma, And Technology, All Valued Between 100 Million And 220 Million In 1997, The List Of Most Valued Companies In The World Read General Electric, Royal Dutch, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Coca Cola, Intel, Nippon, Merck Toyota, And Novartis Up Until Even A Decade Ago, Five Of The Top Ten Publicly Listed Companies In Terms Of Market Cap Were Oil Companies, With Exxon Mobil And Petrochina Leading The Way There Were Only Two Tech Companies In The List Apple At 3 And Microsoft At 10 In Fact, Petrochina, A Chinese Oil And Gas Company, An Arm Of State Owned China National Petroleum Corporation, Became The First Company To Roar Past The 1 Trillion Mark In 2007, A Decade Before Apple Rang Up Its First Trillion In Market Cap In January 2007, Just As Petrochina Was Nearing The 1 Trillion Valuation, Apple Introduced Its First Iphone, When The Company Was Still Shy Of Being 100 Billion It Was Worth 73 4 Billion At That Point Introducing The Iphone, Apple Founder Steve Jobs Promised A Leapfrog Product That Would Be Way Smarter Than Any Mobile Device Has Ever Been, Super Easy To Use As It Turned Out, Not Only Did Apple Reinvent The Phone, It Reinvented The Market In The Years To Come, The Iphone Would Become One Of History S Best Selling Products, Racking Up Most Recently Sales Of More 200 Billion Annually Within A Decade The Device Has Now Become So Ubiquitous That Television Presenter Jason Silva, Paraphrasing The Philosopher Descartes, Joked Iphone, Therefore I Am Signs That The Iphone Would Power Apple To The Top Spot Became Clear As Early As 2012, When It Displaced Exxonmobil As The World S Most Valuable Company, With Petrochina Slipping To Third Place The New Age Pinnacle In The Decade Since, Apple Has Never Lost That Pole Position Except In 2019, When Microsoft Briefly Toppled It Founded In 1974, Just A Few Months Before Apple By Jobs Contemporary Bill Gates, Microsoft Is Another Money Spinning Behemoth, Often Ranked With Apple As One Of The Most Profitable Companies In The World Just As Apple Reinvented The Phone, And Itself, With The Iphone, Microsoft Relaunched Itself With Cloud Computing, The Biggest Revenue Source For A Company That Was A Byword For Software Relative To Apple And Microsoft, Which Are Of Mid 1970S Vintage, Amazon And Facebook Were Founded In The 1990S Tesla Is Even Newer, Founded Only In 2003 But Each Has Carved A Niche In The Market In Its Area, With Rivals At A Distant Second By Early This Year, Big Tech Had Completely Trumped Traditional Companies, With Eight Of The Ten Most Valued Companies In The World All Belonging To The Tech Stable Apple, Microsoft, Google Alphabet, Amazon, And Tesla Occupying Top Five Positions, With Nvidia, Meta Facebook, And Tsmc In The 5 10 Slot The Only Exceptions Were Berkshire Hathaway At 6 And United Health At 10 So, Are The T Companies Really Worth All That Much, How Much Further Can They And Will They Grow What Propelled Them To Such Dizzy Heights And Will They Survive These Are Questions That Haunt Every Market Maven As The World Teeters On The Brink Of The Twin Crisis Of War And Pestilence The Recent Tumult Over The Hostile Bid For Twitter, And The Meltdown Of Netflix Stock, Has Raised New Questions On Valuation But One Thing Looks Certain, At Least In Our Lifetime The Trillion Dollar Pinnacle Is The New Summit Large Companies Will Aspire To Climb Copyright

Months After It Had Vowed To Carry Out Shareholder Friendly Policies Isn T The Company Trying To Retrieve Its Investment In A Different Way As The Option Of Going Public Is Likely Blocked Said The Union A Staffer At One Of Kakao Corp S Subsidiaries Told The Korea Herald That Kakao Mobility Employees Have Been Feeling Uneasy As The Direction Of The Company Is Now Unclear We Don T Know Too Much About What S Going On With The Rumored Sell Off We Just Hope Things Become Clear Soon, Said The Staffer Who Requested Anonymity Kakao Corp Is Under Pressure To Resolve Things One Way Or Another, As An Ipo This Year Was Among The Conditions Of The Minority Shareholders Investments In Kakao Mobility It Is Almost Certain That There Would Be Penalty Clauses For Failing To List, Such As A Requirement To Buy Back Shares At An Elevated Price Or To Engage In A Joint Sale To A Third Party But With The Stock Market In Freefall, Mbk Partners Will Be In No Hurry To Complete The Acquisition, According To An Analyst At A Local Private Equity Firm The Value Of Technology Stocks Has Decreased, So I Think It Is Unlikely For Mbk Partners To Buy Kakao Mobility At The Value Of 8 5 Trillion Won Mbk Partners Has No Reason To Go For That Price At The Moment, He Said The Analyst Noted That Mbk Partners Will Also Consider Tag Along Rights Of Tpg And The Carlyle Group During Negotiations With Kakao Corp Tag Along Rights Allow Minority Shareholders To Sell Their Shares If A Majority Shareholder Is Negotiating A Stake Sale If Mbk Partners Were To Acquire A 40 Percent Stake From Kakao Corp As Well As All Shares Owned By Tpg And The Carlyle Group, It Would Approximately Cost 6 4 Trillion Won Such A Large Deal Could Put Some Burden On Mbk Partners, So Won T They Try To Push The Price Further Down The Analyst Said Since The Second Half Of Last Year, Kakao Mobility Has Been Under Fire For Hiking Ride Hailing Fees And Expanding Into New Business Areas To Provide Designated Driver Services, Quick Delivery And Parcel Delivery The Mobility Application Operator Faced Heat From The Public As Its Expanded Services Drove Small Merchants And Business Owners Out Of Work An It Industry Source Told The Korea Herald That The Sale Of Kakao Mobility Could Give Kakao Corp Some Breathing Room Kakao S Public Image Has Worsened Over The Past Year And Kakao Mobility Was One Of The Major Reasons Behind That So I Think Kakao Might Want To Detach Itself From The Mobility Business If A Deal Is Made, It Would Give Kakao Instant Cash, The Source Said After Kakao Mobility Began As A Spinoff Subsidiary From Kakao Corp In 2017, It Quickly Became The Country S Largest Mobility Platform Service Provider Kakao Mobility Has 30 Million Cumulative Users And 10 Million Monthly Active Users, As Of July The Company Recorded
