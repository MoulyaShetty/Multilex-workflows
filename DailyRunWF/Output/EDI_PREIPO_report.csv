"After shelving its plans previously for an IPO in 2022, Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein is now hoping to go public with an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States as soon as 2024.



According to a report from Bloomberg, the company faces environmental, social and governance, or ESG, concerns that could be an obstacle to the IPO.

The $100 billion valuation firm has drawn scrutiny for its cheap product line that has been built on a fast and prolific production chain. A probe by Swiss watchdog group Public Eye said some of Shein’s manufacturers have been subjecting employees to dangerous conditions and 75-hour workweeks, as per a report by CNBC.

bbc

While these concerns have not dissuaded large investors such as Sequoia Capital China, IDG Capital, and Tiger Global Management, recent executive moves within Shein appear to focus on improving their ESG appearance in preparation for a public offering, according to Bloomberg.



Critics reportedly still have issues with Shein garments’ short-term 'wearability', and the criticism has spread to fast-fashion more broadly.

Last year, Shein had overtaken Amazon as top shopping app on US app stores.

Ban In India

Also, Shein was amongst the 59 China linked apps banned by the govt of India in 2020. The ministry of information technology had confirmed the ban, stating that these ""are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”

The Indian government had banned those Chinese apps, including Shein, to tackle privacy and security concerns of the Indian digital space. Around that time, the Indian intelligence agencies had issued a warning against the use of Chinese apps, stating that these apps are not secure and extract a large amount of data outside India.



The other apps that were banned in 2022 included WeChat, TikTok, Mi Video Call, Viva Video, Cam Scanner etc.

"SummaryCompaniesFour years after Khashoggi killing, prince's power undiminishedBiden follows European leaders returning to Saudi ArabiaPrince crushed dissent at home, pushed assertive policy abroadHas taken tough line with Iran, but resumed indirect talksJuly 15 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's powerful crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has emerged unbowed from the international outrage over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi four years ago, as Western leaders who once tried to isolate him now seek his support.U.S. President Joe Biden, who has accused the prince of ordering Khashoggi's murder and said Saudi Arabia should be made a pariah, will visit the oil-producing kingdom on Friday hoping for a respite from soaring global petroleum prices.He follows in the footsteps of European leaders who condemned the 2018 killing of Khashoggi by a Saudi hit squad in Istanbul but accept they cannot ignore the global energy giant and its de facto ruler.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterOnly 36 years old and nominally still waiting to inherit power from his elderly father King Salman, the prince has already stamped his mark on the kingdom and the Middle East.He has crushed dissent and sidelined rivals in an unrelenting push for control at home while pursuing a more forceful foreign policy in the region, taking steps which have delighted admirers, unsettled Riyadh's traditional allies and shocked human rights advocates.The killing of Khashoggi, an insider-turned-critic, was a particularly heavy blow to the prestige of the prince, known by his initials MbS. He has denied ordering the operation although he accepted ultimate responsibility ""as a leader"".The murder deterred some investors and dramatically undercut MbS's promotion of himself as a reformer pursuing new freedoms in the conservative kingdom and home of Islam's holiest sites.But faced with the reality of an assertive leader who could be running the Middle East's largest economy for several decades to come, his critics abroad appear to have backed down.""The whole attempt by the West post-Khashoggi to try to limit interaction with MbS was incrementally eroded, and Biden's visit will really put a bullet into that idea,"" said Ayham Kamel of consultancy Eurasia Group.""He is there to revive the Saudi-U.S. relationship which in the current geopolitical environment - because of the Ukraine war, because of China competition, because of energy issues and Saudi Arabia's regional influence - needs to be fixed.""Under the Crown Prince's watch far-reaching reforms, including the listing of state oil giant Saudi Aramco(2222.SE), have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent and activism, detention of women's rights activists and a secretive purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges.At the same time, he pledged a tougher stance against the regional influence of sworn foe Iran and took the kingdom into a costly and unpopular war in Yemen.He won vocal support from former U.S. President Donald Trump, but after Biden pledged to take a harder line on Saudi Arabia the prince made overtures seen by diplomats as showing he was a valuable partner for regional stability.The moves included a deal to end a bitter row with Qatar that saw Riyadh and its allies boycott Doha, launching direct talks with Iran to contain tensions, and a truce in Yemen.But U.S. ties remain strained by Washington's restrictions on arms sales to the kingdom and indirect U.S.-Iran talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, without Gulf participation. Biden has also refused to deal directly with MbS as de facto ruler.""Simply, I do not care,” the crown prince said in a March 2022 interview with The Atlantic, when asked whether Biden misunderstood things about him.RESENTMENT WITHIN FAMILYMbS rose from near obscurity after his father ascended the throne in 2015. He marginalized senior members of the royal family after ousting an older cousin as crown prince in a 2017 palace coup, and consolidated control over Saudi security and intelligence agencies, stirring resentment within the family.Later that year, he arrested several royals and other prominent Saudis, holding them for months at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel in an anti-corruption campaign that caused shockwaves at home and abroad.On the economy, MbS announced sweeping changes aimed at developing new industries to create jobs for Saudis and introducing fiscal reforms.High profile social reforms included allowing cinemas and public entertainment and ending a ban on women driving.While he is popular among young Saudis and has supporters among many royals, some ruling family members resent Mohammed's grip on power and questioned his leadership after unprecedented attacks on Saudi oil plants in 2019, according to sources with ties to the royals and business elite.In March 2020, authorities detained his cousin, former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef and the king's brother Prince Ahmed in a move sources with royal connections said aimed at ensuring a smooth succession.MbS has admirers in the region, with one Gulf source saying his ""bulldozer"" approach was needed to change Saudi Arabia.The cornerstone of the economic transformation was selling shares in Aramco(2222.SE). A listing on the domestic bourse went ahead in 2019 after several false starts, briefly hitting a $2 trillion valuation, but there was not enough investor appetite for a foreign offering.The prince has also reshaped Saudi foreign policy.The kingdom's assertiveness under MbS followed what some hawkish Saudi officials regarded as a decade of growing Iranian influence across the region and concerns that Washington under former President Barack Obama turned a blind eye to what they saw as pernicious expansion of Iranian activity in Arab nations.However, while Riyadh and Tehran cut diplomatic ties in 2016, they launched direct talks in 2021 aimed at reducing tensions at a time Gulf states voice doubt about the U.S. commitment to the region.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterEditing by William MacleanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",15/Jul/2022 00:00:00,15/Jul/2022 18:32:40,Saudi Arabia's powerful prince unbowed by Western uproar,"[undiminishedBiden, Reuters, FREE, Riyadh, Islam, Eurasia Group, the Crown Prince's, Ritz-Carlton, FREE, The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles],[]",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2YW0BQ

Badenoch, 42, supported leaving the European Union in the 2016 referendum.She says she believes in limited government ""focused on doing some things well, not lots of things badly"".She has said she wants tax cuts, but only if government spending also comes down, and has criticised net-zero emissions targets and restrictions on free speech.PENNY MORDAUNTThe former defence secretary was sacked by Johnson after she endorsed his rival, Jeremy Hunt, during the 2019 leadership contest.Mordaunt, 49, was a passionate supporter of leaving the EU and has said she will aim to deliver the benefits of Brexit and help Britain recover from economic shocks such as the pandemic.Currently a junior trade minister, Mordaunt called the COVID lockdown-breaking parties in government ""shameful"" and has said that if she is prime minister, leadership has to change to be less about the leader.RISHI SUNAKIn his campaign launch video, Sunak promised to confront the difficult economic backdrop with ""honesty, seriousness and determination"", rather than piling the burden onto future generations.  read more The 42-year-old became finance minister in early 2020 and was praised for a COVID economic rescue package, including a costly jobs retention programme that averted mass unemployment.But he later faced criticism for not giving enough cost-of-living support to households. Revelations this year about his wealthy wife's non-domiciled tax status, and a fine he received for breaking COVID lockdown rules, have damaged his standing.His tax-and-spend budget last year put Britain on course for its biggest tax burden since the 1950s, undermining his claims to favour lower taxes.Sunak voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.LIZ TRUSSThe foreign secretary has been the darling of the Conservative Party's grassroots and has regularly topped polls of party members carried out by the website Conservative Home.Truss has a carefully cultivated public image and was photographed in a tank last year, echoing a famous 1986 photo of Thatcher.She spent the first two years of Johnson's premiership as international trade secretary and is now in charge of dealing with the EU over post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland, where she has taken an increasingly tough line in negotiations.Truss, 46, initially campaigned against Brexit but after the 2016 referendum said she had changed her mind.TOM TUGENDHATThe chair of parliament's foreign affairs committee, and a former soldier who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, he is relatively untested because he has never served in Cabinet.Tugendhat, 49, has been a regular critic of Johnson and would offer his party a clean break with previous governments.He says he is a low-tax Conservative who did not support the rise in National Insurance, and has said fuel tax is ""crippling"" for many people.He voted to remain in the EU.($1 = 0.7971 pound)Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterAdditional reporting by Alistair Smout

KUALA LUMPUR: Global initial public offering (IPO) saw its year-to-date (YTD) volumes fall 46 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) to 630 IPOs, with proceeds shrinking 58 per cent y-o-y to US$95.4 billion (US$1=RM4.44), as heightened volatility caused by geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic factors, declining valuation and poor post-IPO share price performance led to the postponement of many IPOs. In a statement today, EY Initial Public Offering Services said for the second quarter of 2022 (Q2 2022), the global IPO market recorded 305 deals raising US$40.6 billion in proceeds, down 54 per cent and 65 per cent y-o-y, respectively. It said during the period under review, the energy sector had replaced the technology sector as the top IPO fundraiser, whereby among the top 10 largest IPOs by proceeds which raised US$40 billion, energy dominated three of the top four deals, replacing the technology sector.  ""The technology sector continued to lead by number, but the average IPO deal size came down to US$137 million from US$293 million, whereas energy has overtaken to lead by proceeds with average deal size increasing to US$680 million from US$191 million,"" it said. Regionally, EY said the IPO activity in the Americas region saw the sharpest decline (among all regions) in Q2 2022 versus Q2 2021, with deals decreasing 73 per cent y-o-y to 41 IPOs, and proceeds falling 95 per cent y-o-y to US$2.5 billion. However, it said compared with Q1 2022, the number of deals and proceeds in the region were up 14 per cent y-o-y and six per cent y-o-y, respectively. For the ASEAN region, it said YTD, the grouping registered a total of 54 IPOs raising US$2.4 billion, down two per cent y-o-y in the number of deals and 55 per cent y-o-y in proceeds. ""The notable decline in proceeds was due to a lack of mega IPOs (IPOs with proceeds equal to or greater than US$1 billion) YTD 2022, compared to three mega IPOs in YTD 2021 that raised US$3.9 billion,"" it said. It unveiled that the most active ASEAN exchanges were Indonesia (22 IPOs raising US$1.3 billion), Thailand (13 IPOs; US$300 million), and Philippines (seven IPOs; US$300 million), followed by Malaysia (six IPOs; US$500 million) and Singapore (six IPOs raising US$33 million). For Asia-Pacific, EY said the region finished the quarter with a 42 per cent y-o-y decline in proceeds and 37 per cent y-o-y decline in deals. ""The region saw 181 IPOs raising US$ 23.3 billion in proceeds during Q2 and 367 IPOs raising US$66.0 billion in proceeds YTD 2022. However, Asia-Pacific markets performed relatively better benefitting from the two largest global IPOs YTD,"" it said. On outlook for Q3 2022, EY believes that uncertainties and volatility are likely to remain, including geopolitical strains, macroeconomic factors, weak capital market performance, and the impact from the lingering pandemic on global travel and related sectors. Nonetheless, it noted that there were many mega IPOs postponed in the first half of 2022, which represents a healthy pipeline of deals that are likely to come to the market when the current uncertainties and volatility subside. It said the technology sector is also likely to continue as the leading sector in terms of the number of deals coming to the market.  ""However, with a greater focus on renewable sources of energy in the face of increasing oil prices, the energy sector is expected to continue to lead by proceeds from bigger deals,"" it said, adding that environmental, social, and governance (ESG)  will continue to be a sector-agnostic key theme for investors and IPO candidates. - Bernama

" NEW YORK, July 15, 2022 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
 Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Molecular Partners AG (""Molecular Partners"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: MOLN) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Molecular Partners securities between June 16, 2021 and April 26, 2022, both dates inclusive, or pursuant to the Company's June 16, 2021 IPO (the ""Class Period""). Investors have until September 12, 2022 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.
 Click here to participate in the action.
 Molecular Partners operates as a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapeutic proteins. Leading up to and following the IPO, the Company repeatedly touted the clinical and commercial prospects of certain of its product candidates under development in collaboration with other companies.
 Among other product candidates, Molecular Partners is developing ensovibep as a treatment for COVID-19 in collaboration with Novartis AG (""Novartis""). One of the Company's most important development strategies for ensovibep includes securing Emergency Use Authorization (""EUA"") for ensovibep from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"").
 In addition, Molecular Partners is developing MP0310 (AMG 506) for the treatment of certain types of cancer in collaboration with Amgen Inc. (""Amgen""). The Company granted Amgen, among other licenses, the right to progress MP0310's development program into later stage development, including into combination trials, following Phase 1 data.
 On April 22, 2021, Molecular Partners filed a registration statement on Form F-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") in connection with the IPO, which, after several amendments, was declared effective by the SEC on June 15, 2021 (the ""Registration Statement"").
 On June 16, 2021, Molecular Partners filed a prospectus on Form 424B4 with the SEC in connection with the IPO, which incorporated and formed part of the Registration Statement (collectively, the ""Offering Documents"").
 Pursuant to the Offering Documents, Molecular Partners conducted the IPO, issuing 3 million of its ADSs to the public at the IPO price $21.25 per ADS, for proceeds to the Company of over $59 million, after underwriting discounts and commissions, and before expenses.
 On November 16, 2021, Molecular Partners disclosed that ""a planned futility analysis of ensovibep in [an] ongoing [Phase 3] clinical study . . . has not met the thresholds required to continue enrollment of adults with COVID-19 in the hospitalized setting.""
 On this news, Molecular Partners' ADS price fell $4.64 per ADS, or 31.37%, to close at $10.15 per ADS on November 16, 2021.
 On April 26, 2022, months after applying for EUA from the FDA for ensovibep, Novartis' Chief Executive Officer, Vas Narasimhan, disclosed that ""given the latest feedback . . . in our discussions with the [FDA], we would expect the agency to require a Phase 3 study before granting an EUA approval or a general approval"" for ensovibep, and that ""we need to make a kind of sober evaluation as to is it a doable study in light of the waning rates of COVID around the world[.]""
 On this news, Molecular Partners' ADS price fell $2.68 per ADS, or 16.17%, to close at $13.89 per ADS on April 26, 2022.
 Then, also on April 26, 2022, during after-market hours, Molecular Partners ""announced that Amgen . . . has informed the Company of their decision to return global rights of MP0310 to Molecular Partners following a strategic pipeline review.""
 On this news, Molecular Partners' ADS price fell $5.19 per ADS, or 37.37%, to close at $8.70 per ADS on April 27, 2022--a total decline of $7.87 per ADS, or 47.5%, over two consecutive trading days, and 59.06% below the $21.25 per ADS IPO price.
 As of the time the complaint was filed, the price of Molecular Partners' ADSs continued to trade below the $21.25 per ADS IPO price, damaging investors.
 The complaint alleges that the Offering Documents were negligently prepared and, as a result, contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and were not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their preparation. Additionally, the complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Offering Documents and Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) ensovibep was less effective at treating COVID-19 than Defendants had led investors to believe; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was reasonably likely to require an additional Phase 3 study of ensovibep before granting the drug EUA; (iii) waning global rates of COVID-19 significantly reduced the Company's chances of securing EUA for ensovibep; (iv) as a product candidate, MP0310 was less attractive to Amgen than Defendants had led investors to believe; (v) accordingly, there was a significant likelihood that Amgen would return global rights of MP0310 to Molecular Partners; (vi) as a result of all the foregoing, the clinical and commercial prospects of ensovibep and MP0310 were overstated; and (vii) as a result, the Offering Documents and Defendants' public statements throughout the Class Period were materially false and/or misleading and failed to state information required to be stated therein.

"Reporter: Ika Puspitasari | Editor: Herlina Kartika Dewi KONTAN.CO.ID - JAKARTA. Wheat flour producer PT Cerestar Indonesia Tbk (TRGU) immediately stepped on the gas for business expansion after holding an initial public offering (IPO). Cerestar Indonesia views that the wheat flour industry in Indonesia has great potential to develop, given the level of consumption per capita of wheat flour is still quite low. Moreover, Indonesia is the country with the largest population in ASEAN, so it has a very strong domestic market share to absorb wheat flour production. Mulyadi Chandra, Corporate Secretary and CFO of PT Cerestar Indonesia Tbk said, Cerestar Indonesia's business prospects in 2022 are also quite good and promising. Whether it's for wheat flour products or in animal feed products. Also Read: Initial Listing, Cerestar Indonesia Stock (TRGU) Mentok ARA According to him, one of the driving factors is the tendency of the current young generation, namely the age of 20-35 years, to start shifting and like food products from bread and noodles. ""For example, if we see that there are many bakeries and food made from processed noodles, especially in big cities,"" he told Kontan.co.id, Friday (15/7). In addition, Mulyadi explained, promising business prospects can also be seen in the feed ingredients business line or animal feed ingredients. He said that the product produced from processed wheat by his subsidiary, PT Harvestar Flour Mills (HFM), is one of the feed ingredients that has been marketed by the affiliated company PT Agristar Grain Indonesia (AGI) for a long time. Well, in the last year Cerestar Indonesia has also tried to market other feed ingredients products such as soybean meal, dried grain distillers with solubles (DDGS) which turned out to be quite encouraging. Thus, TRGU focuses on working on this market through its subsidiary Agristar Grain Industry. Therefore, overall TRGU management sees good prospects for business development. Cerestar Indonesia plans to leverage production capacity this year. Through its subsidiary PT Harvestar Flour Mills, Cerestar will add a capacity of 600 MT per day. Mulyadi added that currently the total production capacity through HFM is 1,600 MT per day, with utilization reaching 90%. Thus, TRGU's production capacity will reach 2,200 MT per day. In order to leverage sales performance, this issuer is also committed to maintaining the quality of its products. In addition, said Mulyadi, the company will also diversify products other than wheat flour. Now, TRGU is starting to process yellow soybeans for other food raw materials, such as tofu and tempeh. ""Through PT Agristar Grain Industry (AGY), we will build a warehouse and packing facility in Cilegon for feed ingredients products,"" he explained. Later, the warehouse will be built on an area of ​​5 hectares. In order to launch the business development, Cerestar Indonesia has pocketed fresh funds from the IPO worth Rp 315 billion. Also Read: TRGU, CHEM and ARKO Enter Public Offering Period, Here's Analyst's Calculations During the celebration, TRGU offered a maximum of 1.5 billion shares, or equivalent to 18.88% of the total paid-up capital of the Company after the IPO. In detail, about 46.67% of the proceeds from the IPO will be used to purchase new machines to increase the production capacity of HFM. Furthermore, approximately 33.33% will be used for the construction of AGY's warehouse and packing facilities located in Cilegon, and approximately 20.00% will be used for the purchase of land in the Gresik Industrial Estate as an additional HFM support facility. For information, currently TRGU has five brands of wheat flour products, namely Bakerstar, Falcon, Seagull, Dragonfly and Starfis. Mulyadi said that his party is still focused on filling the local market. Cerestar Indonesia sells its products to distributors Kabilinco Jaya, Agristar Grain Indonesia, and Dairyfood Internusa. TRGU also sells its products to the export market, but the portion is still small and there is no plan to expand the export market. Mulyadi said that the portion of export sales only contributed about 2% which was marketed to China and Timor Leste. While the rest are marketed domestically. TRGU Chart by TradingView . With these business development efforts, Mulyadi hopes that TRGU will be able to achieve performance growth this year. Unfortunately, he has not been able to convey the details of the 2022 performance target, in line with the current unstable world economy. This is due to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the increase in the Fed's interest rates which also affected the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar. ""However, we are still optimistic even though we are careful, at the end of the year we will be able to post a profit,"" he added. As of December 31, 2021, TRGU recorded sales of Rp 3.42 trillion, an increase of Rp. 2.68 trillion, equivalent to 361.36% compared to sales in August-December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly due to increased sales by local and subsidiary companies to related parties. namely to PT Kabulinco Jaya and PT Agristar Grain Indonesia. In line with that, Cerestar Indonesia's cost of goods sold also increased, so that last year it still recorded a net loss of Rp 15.54 billion.

Read also: Two Prospective Central Bookbuilding Issuers, Utama Radar (RCCC) and Agung Menjangan (AMMS) Because it has been half a year, investors are also looking forward to the performance of companies that have IPOs in the last six months, especially those that conduct IPOs in early 2022. From the movement of a number of shares that have IPOs, investors gain experience to see how the potential of companies that IPO for this year are. “That's what makes IPO sentiments tend to be limited, not negative. Investors will tend to be selective,” explained Lucky when contacted by Kontan.co.id, Monday (11/7). So, when the market is volatile, Lucky advises investors to pay attention to blue chip stocks. The fundamental performance of blue chip issuers will be solid, especially issuers of commodities with derivatives of gold, coal and oil. Read also: Bank Muamalat to Hold IPO at the end of 2023 Lucky has a fairly bullish attitude towards commodity prices. For example, he projects that the price of this energy commodity will reach the level of US$ 500 per metric ton (MT) by the end of the year. Apart from the rainy season which hampered production, the market is also considering the inflation rate in the United States (US). ""So market players see commodities as an option,"" continued Lucky. For crude oil, he targets the price to reach US$ 125 per barrel and gold price to be at US$ 1,900 per ounce troy by the end of the year. Even if investors want to buy shares with an IPO, Lucky said there are three sectors that are quite sexy to observe, namely commodities, banking/finance, and basic industries. Meanwhile, according to Herditya, because big cap stocks currently tend to be depressed, investors can choose issuers that profit seasonally. ""As currently stocks are based on mining and energy,"" concluded Herditya.

"Most stock markets in the Gulf ended higher on Tuesday, tracking oil prices and global shares as China eased some quarantine requirements for international arrivals which raised hopes for stronger growth and a revival in demand for commodities. China slashed the quarantine time for inbound travellers by half in a major easing of one of the world's strictest COVID-19 curbs, which have deterred cross-border travel and resulted in international flights running at just 2% of pre-pandemic levels. Saudi Arabia's benchmark index leapt 2.1%, buoyed by a 3.3% rise in oil behemoth Saudi Aramco and a 3.4% increase in the country's biggest lender Saudi National Bank. Oil prices, a key factor for the Gulf's financial markets, swung higher after China eased quarantine rules, with focus already on tight supply as G7 leaders agreed to study placing price caps on imports of Russian oil and gas. The energy index in the kingdom advanced 3.2%. Dubai's main share index added 1.1%, led by a 1.9% gain in Emirates NBD Bank and a 1.6% rise in sharia-compliant lender Dubai Islamic Bank. Dubai business park operator TECOM Group said on Monday it had raised 1.7 billion dirhams ($462.87 million) from investors via its initial public offering. Over the short term, the market remains supported by the success of Tecom's IPO, according to Fadi Reyad, market analyst at CAPEX.com.

"HONG KONG - China's central leadership has given billionaire Jack Ma's Ant Group a tentative green light to revive its initial public offering (IPO), two sources with knowledge of the matter said, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is easing its crackdown on the tech sector. Ant, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, aims to file a preliminary prospectus for the share offering in Shanghai and Hong Kong as early as next month, the sources said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The fintech giant will need to wait for guidance from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on the specific timing of the prospectus filing, said one of the sources. In a publicly released statement, Ant said there was no plan to relaunch its IPO, without elaborating. It did not respond to Reuters request for comment on whether it had received a green light from Beijing. The company's stock market listing was hastily shelved at the behest of Beijing in November 2020. At the time, it was slated to be valued at around $315 billion and planned to raise $37 billion, which would have been a world record. ""Under the guidance of regulators, we are focused on steadily moving forward with our rectification work and do not have any plan to initiate an IPO,"" Ant said on its WeChat account late on Thursday. Neither the CSRC nor China's State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for central leaders, responded to Reuters' request for comment. Ant wants to keep the IPO revival plans low profile pending a formal announcement, after having attracted regulatory glare in its first attempt back in 2020 with the waves the offering created as the world's largest ever equity float, a separate source with direct knowledge of the matter said. Chinese authorities pulled the plug on the IPO and cracked down on Ma's business empire after he gave a speech in Shanghai in October 2020 accusing financial watchdogs of stifling innovation. The IPO's derailment marked the start of a regulatory crackdown to rein in China's huge homegrown technology sector, which spread to other industries, including property and private education, wiping billions off market capitalisations and triggering layoffs at some firms. With its economy slowing in a politically sensitive year when Xi Jinping is expected to secure an unprecedented third term as party leader, Beijing is looking to loosen it grip on private businesses including tech giants to help it meet a growth target of 5.5%, something economists have said will be hard to reach given COVID-19 lockdowns. ""They are rolling back on their crackdown to counterbalance the lockdown they've had. Any data out of China lately has been dreadful because of lockdowns and the last thing they want to do is compound that issue. In the next three to six months we are likely to see China's crackdown unwound,"" said David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital in London. A revival of the IPO may also mark a rehabilitation of sorts for Ma, who has been maintaining a low public profile since Beijing swooped. EASING EFFORTS Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He last month told tech executives the government supported the development of the sector and will back firms pursuing listings at home and abroad. In another sign of Beijing's softer stance, China's ride-hailer Didi Global, which has been under a cybersecurity probe since last year, is in advanced talks to buy a third of a state-backed electric-vehicle maker, Reuters reported on Wednesday. News of the talks comes after the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Chinese regulators are set to conclude their investigations into Didi, which could offer more hope to investors about its recovery. Bloomberg reported earlier on Thursday that Chinese financial regulators had started early stage talks on a potential revival of Ant's stock market debut, without mentioning a timeline. The top securities regulator had established a team to reassess the share sale plans, Bloomberg reported. The regulator later said in a statement it had not conducted any assessment or research work regarding an Ant IPO. The U.S. listed shares of Alibaba, which owns nearly one-third of Ant, were down 7% after earlier rising as much as 7% in pre-market trading on the Bloomberg report. U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus, a big investor in Ant's 2018 private fundraising, lowered its valuation of Ant to about $180 billion at end-March from $221 billion one year earlier, a separate source said. The regulators have directed Ant to restructure as a financial rather than tech firm, and sources and analysts have said the financial sector typically carries lower valuations. Warburg Pincus declined to comment on Thursday. ""The size of Ant and the IPO will have to be smaller than what was planned in 2020 because the market conditions have changed and cannot be compared to now,"" said Dickie Wong, executive director of Kingston Securities in Hong Kong. U.S.-listed shares of Chinese tech and e-commerce firms including Didi and Alibaba have gained this week on hints Beijing's one-and-a-half year long crackdown may be easing.

"NEW YORK - Investment banks have raked in billions of dollars by feeding the frenzy for blank-check companies, and they have done so largely without risking any of their own money on hundreds of deals that have left many investors with punishing losses. A look at one of these deals shows how. In late 2020, Acies Acquisition Corp tapped into investor demand for blank-check companies – formally known as special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs – with an initial public offering that raised $215 million. Among the investment banks Acies signed up to underwrite the IPO were JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer & Co. When the offering closed, Acies, essentially a shell company, followed the SPAC template. With the cash it had raised, it had two years to find and merge with a private company seeking a stock market listing, or return the money to investors. Acies’ management team announced it was on the hunt for a business in the “experiential entertainment industry.” The team didn’t have to look for very long. Hours after the IPO closed, bankers advising Playstudios Inc contacted Acies managers to tell them the Las Vegas-based maker of mobile casino games was for sale, regulatory filings show. Those bankers were also with JPMorgan. In early 2021, the two companies announced plans for a merger that valued Playstudios at $1.1 billion. In the run-up to the merger and the listing of the combined company’s shares, Playstudios touted a rosy future. It forecast that surging ad sales, a new role-playing game and cross-marketing offerings to game players would bring a 20% rise in revenue in 2021 and a 33% jump this year. Since then, the company has scrapped the new game, and revenue fell far short of predictions. Retail investors suffered the consequences. The stock is down more than 50% since shareholders approved the merger last June. “Playstudios is one that looks like crap right now,” Dan Ushman, a 37-year-old Chicago-area entrepreneur, said earlier this year. He put about $26,000 into Acies after it announced its deal with Playstudios and soon saw his investment drop more than 35%. Investment banks involved in the deal fared much better, having risked none of their own money, based on a Reuters review of regulatory filings. JPMorgan, in particular, pocketed hefty fees for its dual role as an underwriter for the Acies IPO and as an adviser to Playstudios – perfectly legal, despite the apparent conflict of interest, if the bank discloses its role, as JPMorgan did. The bank has not disclosed its fees, but financial data provider Refinitiv estimates that JPMorgan earned $4.7 million in underwriting fees and $14.2 million as a sell-side adviser. It also received $1.6 million for helping Acies raise additional capital through a maneuver known as private investment in public equity, or PIPE, according to financial research firm Morningstar Inc and a Reuters analysis. PIPEs, which tap big institutional investors, are often necessary to close a SPAC merger. Morgan Stanley earned about $5.9 million and Oppenheimer about $1.2 million in underwriting fees, according to Refinitiv estimates. Each bank also got about $1.6 million in PIPE-related fees, according to Morningstar and a Reuters analysis. LionTree Advisors, another Playstudios adviser, earned $6.2 million on the deal, according to Refinitiv estimates, plus $1.6 million in PIPE fees, according to Morningstar and a Reuters analysis. JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and LionTree declined to comment. An Oppenheimer spokesman said the bank had a minor role in the Acies IPO. Playstudios noted that the JPMorgan teams it and Acies worked with came from separate divisions of the bank. The company said it has “a robust framework for evaluating, approving, executing and optimizing its game initiatives,” and that it is continually “revisiting the conditions and decision to either advance or suspend an initiative.” A CURIOUS PATTERN The disparate outcomes of the Acies-Playstudios deal – big bucks for the investment banks that sold it and big losses for retail investors who bought into it – are typical of many SPAC deals. For this article, Reuters analyzed hundreds of SPACs spanning roughly two years, reviewed banks’ internal documents and regulatory filings, and interviewed more than two dozen bankers, investors, SPAC managers, lawyers and corporate executives. The examination found that investment banks turbocharged to their benefit what turned out to be a speculative bubble in companies that have often failed to live up to their pre-listing hype. The SPAC market has sagged since the collapse of some high-profile blank-check listings amid overall grim market conditions. And in March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed new rules that would increase disclosure requirements and potential legal liability for SPACs and their banks. Facing these market and regulatory challenges, some banks have been pulling back from the business. Whatever happens to the SPAC market, the Reuters examination reveals in detail for the first time how, over the past couple of years, Wall Street banks have enriched themselves by aggressively promoting the deals in the absence of the legal guardrails and financial risks associated with traditional IPOs. Credit Suisse summed it up last year in a confidential client presentation reviewed by Reuters: SPACs “bend the rules” of the IPO market. The Swiss bank has had a role in 136 blank-check deals since the beginning of 2020 through the end of March, according to a Reuters analysis of SPAC Research data. A Credit Suisse spokesperson said the language in the presentation pertains to SPAC “market conventions” that give companies and investors more flexibility than in traditional IPOs. The bank is committed to “recommending strategies that conform to all applicable rules,” the spokesperson said. In a traditional IPO, underwriters can be held responsible under securities law for any misleading forecasts, projections or other statements made to investors. To protect themselves against liability, banks perform rigorous due diligence on companies whose IPOs they underwrite, and those companies generally do not issue public forecasts about their performance. Banks also buy big chunks of an issuing company’s new shares, risking losses if they can’t resell the stock for more than they paid. With a SPAC, a bank's role as underwriter ends once the blank-check company completes its IPO, but the bank receives a portion of its fee only after the SPAC makes an acquisition. By the time the SPAC announces a merger, SPAC underwriters aren’t responsible for forecasts and other claims about the performance of the company to be acquired and publicly listed. And because blank-check IPOs are typically priced at a nominal $10, banks don't run the risk of having to sell new shares that fall in value. For investment banks, blank-check deals create “moral hazard” – an incentive to take on risk because of little exposure to it – according to Usha Rodrigues, a law professor at the University of Georgia who studies SPACs. That’s because they “don’t have the same liability with a SPAC that they have with a traditional IPO, but banks do get to collect fees if they can get a deal done,” she said. The “companies that merged with SPACs … don’t have the same level of vetting,” which most retail investors do not realize. Shares of companies that obtained a stock market listing in a SPAC merger from 2019 through the beginning of March were down roughly 36% on average from when their deals closed, according to data provided by Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida. That’s even worse than the 14% decline in shares of companies that went public through traditional IPOs during the same period, according to Nasdaq Inc. All told, according to Vanda Research, retail investors lost $4.8 billion, or 23%, of the aggregate $21.3 billion they plowed into SPACs from the beginning of 2020 to the first week of April 2022. Yet the deals that brought those shares to market have yielded a bonanza for investment banks. Industry tracker Coalition Greenwich estimates that banks booked about $8 billion in SPAC-related fees in 2020 and 2021. That represents roughly 6.5% of total U.S. investment banking fees that major banks collected in that period, according to Coalition Greenwich. “The bank has an incentive to push the deal to get closed, at any price, because they want their 3.5% of the SPAC IPO proceeds,” said Mike Stegemoller, a professor of banking and finance at Baylor University, referring to the fees underwriters receive only after a SPAC merger closes. “I think the conflict is with retail investors who are buying common shares of stock … Do you really think banks care about these retail investors? I think there are good incentives not to.” Many banks amped up their take by working for both sides of deals, as JPMorgan did with Acies and Playstudios. Reuters identified roughly 50 such cases from early 2020 to November 2021. SOURED SENTIMENT As the SPAC bubble has deflated, debate over responsibility for investor losses has focused on the executives of blank-check companies. These founding investors – referred to as sponsors – risk losing all of their investment if they can’t find a company to take public through a merger within the two-year window. However, founders acquire their shares at deep discounts to the typical $10 offering price, thanks to preferential treatment and fees that can dilute retail investors’ holdings. Likewise, the hedge funds and other institutional investors that account for a lot of the money behind SPACs often obtain their shares in an IPO or subsequent PIPE under favorable terms that put them at an advantage relative to retail investors. The SEC put SPACs on notice last year with several enforcement actions against specific companies and their sponsors for allegedly misleading investors about their prospects. Then, in late March, the regulator announced its proposed rules, which would, among other things, establish that investment banks that underwrite SPACs could be held legally liable for false or misleading forecasts or statements about blank-check deals. The SEC will vote on the rules after the public-comment period ends later this spring. The SEC declined to comment. In a March 30 statement on the proposed rules, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said “gatekeepers” such as underwriters “should have to stand behind and be responsible for basic aspects of their work” and “provide an essential function to police fraud and ensure the accuracy of disclosure to investors.” In its proposed rules, the SEC said that the fees underwriting banks receive when a SPAC closes a deal could indicate participation in the merger, and that banks also have a “strong financial interest” in making sure a SPAC inks a deal. For these reasons, the regulator said, it is proposing increasing banks’ liability. To date, investors have not sought to hold major Wall Street banks responsible for false or misleading information alleged in any of the 47 SPAC-related class action shareholder lawsuits filed since 2021, according to a Reuters analysis of a public database maintained by Stanford Law School and attorney Kevin LaCroix, who follows the cases. None of those cases have yet succeeded in court. One aspect of SPACs that has already drawn regulatory scrutiny is undisclosed dealings between blank-check companies and their targets before a merger is announced. That’s because investors could be misled if a SPAC privately shakes hands with an acquisition target while publicly stating it is still seeking the best possible merger partner. Communications between a SPAC and its acquisition target are part of an SEC investigation of former U.S. President Donald Trump's $1.25 billion deal, announced last October, to list his new social media venture on the stock market. In a December filing, Digital World Acquisition Corp, the SPAC that is merging with the former president’s Trump Media & Technology Group, disclosed that the SEC had asked for documents relating to communications between Digital World and Trump Media and meetings of Digital World's board, among other things. The SEC stated in its request that its investigation did not mean the agency had concluded that anyone violated the law, Digital World said. Trump Media has since launched the Truth Social platform to lackluster effect. Trump Media and Digital World Acquisition Corp did not respond to requests for comment. The SEC declined to comment. In the Acies-Playstudios deal, pre-existing relationships raise the question of whether the two companies already had a merger in mind, potentially precluding better deals for investors. Acies told investors when it launched its IPO that it had not identified a company to merge with and that it would pursue the best opportunity it could find. However, Andrew Pascal, chief executive officer of Playstudios, co-founded Acies with Jim Murren, who was chief executive officer of MGM Resorts Inc when that casino operator invested in Playstudios, as was disclosed in a securities filing. Playstudios said it “considered all viable SPAC proposals and eventually made the decision it believed was the best of the available options for the company.” Responding to Reuters inquiries on behalf of Murren and Pascal, Playstudios noted that MGM Resorts, not Murren personally, invested in the company, and that Pascal recused himself from ""all Acies deliberations concerning Playstudios"" once talks began and ""forfeited his economic interest in Acies to avoid even the appearance of having conflicting interests."" BACKWATER TO BONANZA For decades, SPACs were a backwater of Wall Street, connecting speculators with companies that had no other means of going public. That changed in late 2019 and early 2020, when shares of Richard Branson’s spaceflight provider Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc and sports betting operator DraftKings Inc surged more than 600% after going public through SPAC mergers. Investors stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and flush with cash from government stimulus payments helped drive those gains, and they clamored for more. Wall Street banks were happy to oblige and began aggressively promoting the business. In client presentations and other documents reviewed by Reuters, they repeatedly acknowledged the tainted reputation of SPACs and boasted of their ability to bring quality companies to market through blank-check deals. In a 2020 presentation, Morgan Stanley said there was a “historical perception of lower quality companies picking (the) SPAC route, although views have improved somewhat.” For its part, Morgan Stanley said it associated “only with the highest quality partners.” Some of its past partners include Acies, the SPAC that brought Playstudios to market. Shares of the 51 companies that Morgan Stanley has helped take public through SPACs either as an adviser or by raising money to close the deal since the beginning of 2020 were down 28% on average through late March, according to a Reuters analysis. Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the presentation and the performance of shares in companies that went public through its SPACs. Citigroup, in a 2019 presentation, said that while SPACs historically had been considered a “four-letter” word, synonymous with poor outcomes, that perception was changing as investors’ appetite for new alternatives grew. Companies that Citi helped bring to market through SPACs since 2020, either as an adviser or by raising money to close the deal, were down 38% on average at the beginning of May, according to a Reuters analysis of SPAC Research data. Among its many deals, Citi was an underwriter for the IPO of a SPAC called Spartan Acquisition Corp II and an adviser to the company Spartan subsequently acquired, Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc, a financier of solar energy systems. The bank helped Spartan determine its valuation of Sunlight at $1.3 billion, based on Sunlight’s own profit estimates, securities filings show. Sunlight later slashed its profit estimates. The shares, after peaking at about $14.33 in early 2021, are now trading at less than $5. Citi and Sunlight declined to comment. Credit Suisse, in a fourth-quarter 2020 presentation to corporate clients, pointed out that the latitude companies enjoy when issuing business forecasts in SPAC deals can “help improve investor perception of the company.” That would be particularly helpful, it said, for companies that “may have struggled to go public via a traditional IPO.” In the same presentation, Credit Suisse highlighted the “creative marketing tactics” it used in the Virgin Galactic deal. These included flying investors and analysts to tour Virgin Galactic’s factory and Spaceport America complex, which the bank said added “a ‘wow’ factor that a regular-way IPO process could not have provided.” When Virgin Galactic went public, it wasn’t generating any revenue. Its shares soared in the months after the listing, peaking at $62.80. They subsequently tumbled amid delays in some product testing and are now trading below $10. In a 2021 presentation, Credit Suisse asserted that the surge in blank-check deals was being driven by “high quality sponsors” that “seek to partner with blue-chip assets.” Quality aside, share prices of the 56 companies Credit Suisse helped bring to market through SPACs in the past two years were down on average about 32% at the end of March, according to a Reuters analysis of data from SPAC Research. A Credit Suisse spokesperson said the bank is “very selective when it comes to choosing SPAC clients,” and that it treats SPAC mergers “much the same way as regular IPOs” in terms of the bank’s internal approval process. When working for a company that could merge with a SPAC, the bank evaluates alternatives and helps identify the “most suitable course of action,” regardless of whether Credit Suisse underwrote the blank-check firm’s IPO, the spokesperson said. Virgin Galactic declined to comment. Another company Credit Suisse helped bring to market is Paysafe Ltd. The online payments platform was valued at $9 billion in a March 2021 merger with a SPAC. Credit Suisse had underwritten the SPAC’s IPO and acted as an adviser to Paysafe on the subsequent merger. The $9 billion valuation was based in part on Paysafe’s forecast that its digital wallets business would see double-digit growth from 2020 to 2023. Securities filings show that banks were involved in discussions on establishing the valuation. After Paysafe went public, it had to write down its digital wallets business and make technological improvements to it. The shares are down more than 80% from their January 2021 peak. Paysafe decided to go public through a SPAC because it was the “best route to take to public markets,” and hired Credit Suisse because it had worked with the bank on prior deals, according to a company spokesperson. Paysafe has put in place a turnaround plan for its digital wallets business that is “well underway” to “deliver on a new growth trajectory,” the spokesperson said. A representative for Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II, the SPAC that acquired Paysafe, declined to comment. WAITING IN THE WINGS The deal that took car retailer CarLotz Inc public underscores the aggressive tactics banks adopted in their pursuit of SPACs. The Richmond, Virginia-based company, which sells used cars on consignment online and through retail outlets, began looking for a buyer through a conventional sale in late 2019 but failed to find one at the $1 billion price it wanted, a source familiar with the matter said. Several months later, Deutsche Bank pitched itself as a sell-side adviser to CarLotz, pledging to find a SPAC buyer, according to a person familiar with the situation. The bank sought SPAC buyers that would value CarLotz at a minimum of $750 million, based on the $730 million paid for rival Shift Technologies Inc in a recent SPAC merger, and possibly as much as $2 billion, a source familiar with the matter said. And Deutsche Bank already had a bidder waiting in the wings, a SPAC called Acamar Partners Acquisition Corp. Deutsche Bank had advised Acamar as an underwriter on its launch more than a year earlier, and the blank-check company was running out of time to secure a merger. Less than a month after CarLotz hired Deutsche Bank, the bank suggested to Acamar that it make an offer for CarLotz, according to regulatory filings. Acamar made a winning offer of $827 million, less than CarLotz had hoped for, but beating out two other bidders, the filings show. In anticipation of its stock market listing, CarLotz started wooing investors with glowing forecasts. It projected it would have almost $1 billion in sales in 2022, nearly nine times its estimated 2020 revenue. It could meet demand, it said, from a diverse supplier base of used cars from corporate fleets. About seven months later, a supplier representing more than 60% of CarLotz’s cars sold in the prior quarter paused its relationship with the company. Sales dried up. Revenue for 2021 came to only $259 million. CarLotz shares are down more than 90% since they were listed, giving the company a market value of less than $100 million. Deutsche Bank did far better. It received fees of approximately $6.7 million as an underwriter and $14.1 million as an adviser, according to Refinitiv estimates. CarLotz and Acamar did not respond to requests for comment. In an interview, Eric Hackel, head of equity origination solutions at Deutsche Bank, declined to comment on the CarLotz deal specifically. In general, he said, the bank’s due diligence for a traditional IPO is “a little bit more thorough” than for a SPAC, but it does “a tremendous amount of diligence on companies we underwrite.” On deals for which the bank is advising the private company and has also underwritten the SPAC acquiring it, “there’s usually another bank advising,” Hackel said. Ultimately, he said, “it’s up to the company” if they hire the same bank that underwrote the SPAC to advise them on a deal. He noted that retail investors enjoy some of the protections institutional investors have – such as the right to redeem shares for $10 before a deal closes. However, once a deal is done, Hackel said, retail investors “have to make their own decisions. They have to do their own diligence.” Kyle Brown, a 30-year-old accountant in Groton, Connecticut, invested in CarLotz. “We lost the totality of our investment with the exception of $35,” he said. “It was about $11,000, $12,000.” Brown had hoped his investment would help pay for a new house, but he ended up having to find other ways to fund a down payment.

"“A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you’re talking real money,” the late US Senator Everett Dirksen once said, mainly with reference to out-of-control federal spending in America. It was a snarky understatement to emphasise not just wasteful government spending, but also the value of a billion dollars, which, expressed numerically, is 1 followed by nine zeroes — as in, US $1,000,000,000. Although the world’s first billion-dollar company (US Steel) announced itself in 1901, and the world’s first billionaire (John Rockefeller of Standard Oil) was minted in 1916, even in the 1950s, when Dirksen was said to have made the comment, a billion was big, big bucks. Today, a billion dollars — or even a million dollars for that matter — is still a lot of money for an individual. There are approximately 2,800 known billionaires — and many unknown — in the world, a list currently led by Tesla’s Elon Musk, with an estimated wealth of $280bln. But in corporate terms, it is becoming chump change. Companies founded on a whim and prayer, or an app and hope, acquire valuation of a billion dollars in quick time, often based on speculative hope and hype. In an era of easy come-easy go, some endure, many do not. Dubbed Unicorns, a term first popularised by venture capitalist Aileen Lee after the mythical animal to represent the statistical rarity of such successful ventures, they have become a fairly common measure of entrepreneurial fizz. In 2013, when the term was first used to describe startups that scaled up quickly to a billion dollars, there were less than 40 unicorns, mainly in the US. Today, there are an estimated 1,000 unicorns across the world, including 300 in China and 100 in India. Some 30 unicorns, including already-famous names such as SpaceX, Instacart, Stripe, and ByteDance, each valued between $10bln and $100bln, have been given the name Decacorn. Scaling further up, Decacorns become Hectocorns when they are valued at over $100bln. Up until this stage, Unicorns, Decacorns, and Hectocorns are startup companies that are private, venture-backed entities, recognised and evaluated for their potential for growth, and not on their financial performance. Riding on “get big fast” (GBF) strategies, also known as Blitzscaling, these startups try to expand at a high rate through large funding rounds and price cutting to gain an advantage on market share and overrun competitors as quickly as possible. In pursuit of this foothold or market share, many of them don’t make a dime in profit; instead, they burn money to get ahead. Facebook was the first Decacorn and Hectocorn in history, crossing a $100bln valuation before it went public (once they go public with an IPO, they no longer qualify for the informal -corn suffix). It was followed by China’s Alibaba. ByteDance, owners of the app TikTok, which is backed by investors such as Sequoia Capital China and Softbank Group among others, is a current Decacorn, valued at over $140bln — more than the current market cap of storied companies such as AT&T and American Express. Since Facebook became the first privately-held Decacorn-turned-Hectocorn, a $100bln-plus privately-held company, an additional 84 Decacorns have been created. Not all have survived, with 33 of them losing their status for various reasons. This leaves 51 companies still straining at the leash to go public, whereupon they enter new terrain. They include names such as India’s Byju’s, currently valued at $21bln, making it the world’s most valuable education technology startup, and China’s Yuanfudao, also an edtech startup valued at $15.5bln. While Unicorns and Decacorns grow through large funding rounds from private venture capital firms and investors to get an early foothold in the marketplace, sitting on top of the pyramid are companies that do go public and scale a stratospheric height of a trillion dollars — companies for which there is still no agreed upon term as yet. The name Pegasus has been suggested for such companies which reach the new valuation pinnacle of $1trln (like the unicorn, the pegasus is also a mythical horse, but with wind beneath its wings). Collectively, they are simply known as Big Tech. They are the T company. The market cap of $1trln A trillion is no trifling sum. For starters, it is 1 followed by 12 zeroes — as in $1,000,000,000,000. A trillion dollars is greater than the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of all but a score of countries. It is greater than the GDP of Switzerland, Sweden and Argentina, each with GDP below one trillion dollars in nominal terms. For that matter, the valuation of Apple, which recently crossed $3trln (it has since dropped to about $2.65trln at the time of writing), nudged the GDP of Great Britain and India, two of the larger economies of the world. Today, there are around half-a-dozen companies in the world that have a market cap of over $1trln. All but Saudi Aramco are US-born and US-based, and each has a tech orientation. As of March 31, 2022, they are led by Apple ($2.85trln), followed by Microsoft ($2.31trln), Alphabet/ Google ($1.84trln), Amazon ($1.65trln), and, the most recent addition to the list, Tesla ($1.1trln). Couple others have crossed the 1-T mark or nibbled at it and receded — notably PetroChina and Meta/Facebook. The rise, rise, and rise of US tech companies has also led to growing concerns about ‘Big Tech’ — an analogous recall of market dominance by a few companies in other market sectors such as Big Oil and Big Pharma. For instance, the big five tech stocks, originally dubbed FAAMG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google) and now TAAMG (with Tesla replacing Facebook, which has lost nearly 30 per cent of its valuation), account for about a quarter of the market capitalisation of the entire 500 companies in Standard&Poor’s 500. This effectively means 1% of the companies in the index account for about 25% of the total market value. Such market concentration isn’t unusual. In fact, some companies in the past represented an even bigger share of the market. Back in 1932, AT&T accounted for 13% of total US stock market value, more than twice Apple’s approximately 6% share of the current S&P value (about $ 40 trillion). Even further back, in 1928, General Motors represented 8% of the market, and, in 1970, IBM 7%. But there is a big difference in the time and pace of how the modern Big Tech became bellwethers. While four of the five American companies hit the $1trln market cap before the pandemic, what is remarkable is that the onset of Covid-19 — which lowered the boom on many traditional legacy companies — powered Big Tech to even greater heights. For instance, Apple, which hit $1trln market cap on August 2, 2018, doubled that in just two years, going up to $2trln on August 19, 2020, in the middle of the pandemic. It took even less time to breach $3trln (on January 3, 2022) before receding slightly. Similarly, Microsoft went from breaching $1 trillion in June 2019 to surpassing $2trln in June 2021, and Google went from scaling 1-T in January 2020 to topping 2-T in November 2021. So, what gives? How and why did this happen, particularly during a pandemic? The pandemic and the online giants To begin with, even in the pre-pandemic economy, four members of the Trillion Dollar Club (Tesla came late to the party) dominated their respective market: Apple in smartphones, Microsoft in cloud computing, Alphabet/Google in Internet advertising, and Amazon in online retail. When the pandemic kicked in, the stay- work- and buy-from-home economy brought rich rewards to these companies. While the already besieged brick-and-mortar companies collapsed, the online giants boomed, helped in addition by stimulus payments that put money in people’s pockets on top of low interest rates. Apple and Microsoft sales of IT products and cloud services soared, as did Amazon retailing and Google services, as people spent more and more time indoors and online. In many ways, the pandemic helped clarify a trend that was already becoming apparent before Covid-19 struck. Rewind or flashback 25 years, and you will see that the top 10 companies in terms of market cap were a mix of oil, food, pharma, and technology, all valued between $100 million and $220 million. In 1997, the list of most valued companies in the world read General Electric, Royal Dutch, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Coca Cola, Intel, Nippon, Merck Toyota, and Novartis. Up until even a decade ago, five of the top ten publicly listed companies in terms of market cap were oil companies, with Exxon Mobil and PetroChina leading the way. There were only two tech companies in the list — Apple at #3 and Microsoft at #10. In fact, PetroChina, a Chinese oil and gas company, an arm of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, became the first company to roar past the $1 trillion mark in 2007, a decade before Apple rang up its first trillion in market cap. In January 2007, just as PetroChina was nearing the $1 trillion valuation, Apple introduced its first iPhone, when the company was still shy of being $100 billion (it was worth $73.4 billion at that point). Introducing the iPhone, Apple founder Steve Jobs promised a “leapfrog product” that would be “way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, super easy to use”. As it turned out, not only did Apple reinvent the phone, it reinvented the market. In the years to come, the iPhone would become one of history’s best-selling products, racking up (most recently) sales of more $200 billion annually within a decade. The device has now become so ubiquitous that television presenter Jason Silva, paraphrasing the philosopher Descartes, joked “iPhone, therefore I am”. Signs that the iPhone would power Apple to the top spot became clear as early as 2012, when it displaced ExxonMobil as the world’s most valuable company, with PetroChina slipping to third place. The new-age ‘pinnacle’ In the decade since, Apple has never lost that pole position — except in 2019, when Microsoft briefly toppled it. Founded in 1974, just a few months before Apple by Jobs’ contemporary Bill Gates, Microsoft is another money-spinning behemoth, often ranked with Apple as one of the most profitable companies in the world. Just as Apple reinvented the phone, and itself, with the iPhone, Microsoft relaunched itself with cloud computing, the biggest revenue source for a company that was a byword for software. Relative to Apple and Microsoft, which are of mid-1970s vintage, Amazon and Facebook were founded in the 1990s; Tesla is even newer, founded only in 2003. But each has carved a niche in the market in its area, with rivals at a distant second. By early this year, Big Tech had completely trumped traditional companies, with eight of the ten most valued companies in the world all belonging to the tech stable: Apple, Microsoft, Google /Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla occupying top five positions, with Nvidia, Meta/Facebook, and TSMC in the 5-10 slot. The only exceptions were Berkshire Hathaway at #6 and United Health at #10. So, are the T-companies really worth all that much, how much further can they — and will they — grow? What propelled them to such dizzy heights and will they survive? These are questions that haunt every market maven as the world teeters on the brink of the twin crisis of war and pestilence. The recent tumult over the hostile bid for Twitter, and the meltdown of Netflix stock, has raised new questions on valuation. But one thing looks certain, at least in our lifetime: the trillion-dollar pinnacle is the new summit large companies will aspire to climb. Copyright © 2022 Khaleej Times. All Rights Reserved.

"Dubai: With 38 GCC market debuts, 2021 was the best year for new listings since 2007. Yet, the high volume of listings disguises the reality that only one-third are successful. Specifically, just 38% of IPOs were priced adequately - the majority of companies leave too much money on the table. Only 32% of companies traded within the typically desired share price range of 20% within the first 30 days of going public. And merely 31% of new listings outperform companies that are already listed in the longer term. These are among the findings of a new report published by Iridium Advisors, entitled “The Renaissance of IPOs in the GCC,” that examines the success rate of company listing and demystifies some common misconceptions about IPO winners and losers. Iridium’s analysis of 457 initial public offerings in the GCC region between 2005 and 2021, benchmarked companies against three objective criteria of success: 1. Underpricing: the difference between the IPO offer price and the first-day closing price 2. Stabilization period: the 30-day period of price stabilization post-listing 3. Excess return: the relative company share price versus a country index over time “It is very encouraging to see government-owned and private companies embracing public equity markets in the GCC,” says Oliver Schutzmann, CEO of Iridium Advisors and a co-author of the report. “With a well-thought-out program of new public listings, which is already underway, the region has the opportunity to re-energize its capital markets and attract foreign capital to diversify economic growth. Nevertheless, there is still a big mountain to climb to unlock the true capital markets potential of listed companies for both issuers and investors.” Companies planning a public listing need to be aware of the high probability of disappointment and ask why this should be the case. Iridium’s analysis has identified three key areas that are commonly overlooked by company owners, directors and senior management that can play a part in improving the odds of success: 1. There are different dynamics at play in the primary and secondary market: Successful issuers recognize that investors trade among themselves in the secondary market without any direct involvement from the company, and that their company is only worth as much as the last share price. 2.  There is a difference between pre-IPO and post-IPO investors: Companies whose share price outperforms its benchmark after the listing understand that there are different types of investors with varying motivations and interests. 3. The assumption that Public Relations and Investor Relations are synonymous could lead to failure: While both PR and IR have an important role to play, PR features more prominently before and after an IPO, while IR often tends to remain an afterthought. Schutzmann concludes by adding: “The risk of value destruction is real for private and public sector companies in the GCC preparing for an IPO, SPAC, or a direct listing in 2022. It is, however, not inevitable. Key areas of focus to improve the chances of success are taking a long-term view in pre-IPO preparation, identifying the right type of investor, and developing the capability to create organic relationships with the professional investment community. These three steps can guard against major share price gyrations after a listing and will go a long way to ensure that the region’s companies – and their owners - are rewarded with the right valuation by the market.” A copy of the report can be downloaded here.

"Kuwait: Kuwait Financial Centre “Markaz” recently released its Monthly Market Review report for the month of March 2022. In line with its GCC peers, Kuwait’s all share index gained 6.7% in the month of March, supported by a rise in oil prices.

Among Premier Market stocks, National Investments Company and Boursa Kuwait were the top gainers during the month, rising 23.7% and 14.3% respectively. Inflation in Kuwait rose to 4.37% YoY driven by rising prices of food and housing services, in the month of February 2022. Kuwait's government is taking cautious measures to keep critical commodity prices in check and has halted all grain exports for the next three months. Central Bank of Kuwait has raised its main interest rates by 25 bps in March, subsequent to the interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve and Kuwaiti banks are expected to be benefitted by this interest rate hike. Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain have also increased their policy rates by 25 bps. Kuwait’s M2 money supply expanded 1.9% YoY in January, and bank lending to the private sector grew by 6.8% YoY in the same month. Kuwaiti bank revenues grew 7.1% in 2021 with profits almost doubling to $2.9 billion driven by increase in revenues as well as decline in loan loss provisions.

Among the GCC blue chip companies, the best performer was First Abu Dhabi Bank, which gained 14.6% during the month. Due to a sharp increase in oil prices and robust domestic demand, Saudi Arabia's real GDP increased by 6.7 percent year on year in Q4 2021. S&P upgraded Saudi Arabia's outlook from stable to positive, as it expects improved GDP growth and fiscal dynamics in the medium term, improved oil sector prospects and the Government’s reform programs. The IPO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) opened for subscription on March 24, intends to float 17% and could raise as much as USD 5.7billion. Developed markets ended positive for the month with MSCI world gaining 2.5%, S&P 500 gaining 3.6%, Japan’s topix gaining 3.2% and UK’s FTSE gaining 0.8%. US inflation increased 7.9% y/y in Feb 2022, recording a fresh 40-year high mainly driven by rising food and fuel costs. U.S. Treasury yields jumped during the month, with the benchmark 10-year note surging from 1.82% (February end) to 2.35%. In February 2022, the unemployment rate in the US fell to a two-year low of 3.8% as job growth soared. The Bank of England has hiked interest rates three times in a row, returning Bank Rate to its pre-pandemic level of 0.75%. Oil prices were up 6.9% for March 2022 due to supply tightness and United States is considering the release of up to 180 million barrels from its strategic petroleum reserve over several months to calm soaring crude prices. The United States has stated that it will work to supply 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the European Union this year to help reduce their reliance on Russian energy supplies. -Ends- About Kuwait Financial Centre “Markaz” Established in 1974, Kuwait Financial Centre K.P.S.C “Markaz” is one of the leading asset management and investment banking institutions in the MENA region with total assets under management of over KD 1.04 billion as of 31 December 2021.

"Kuwait: Kuwait Financial Centre “Markaz” held its ordinary and extraordinary General Assembly meetings on Sunday, 27 March 2022, with a 75.9% attendance.

The profit per share increased to 31 fils for 2021, where Total Assets under Management recorded an increase for the fifth subsequent quarter, to reach of KD 1.04 billion on December 31, 2021. Commenting on the results, Markaz’s Chairman, Mr. Diraar Yusuf Alghanim said: “The positive financial results recorded for the year ended 31 December, 2021 are testament to the management’s technical ability to identify local and international investment opportunities that generated these outstanding results, in line with the policies established by the Board of Directors and its committees.

Our utmost goal is to reinforce our current record in order to create shareholder value.” Outlook “The recent market changes following the geopolitical fluctuations involving Russia and Ukraine will have a direct and progressive impact on European countries, leading to an increase in inflation levels and the sequential rise of oil prices. That said; it is anticipated that the GCC economies will benefit from these opportunities in 2022, in addition to the restorative initiatives of the GCC governments to promote economic growth and address inflation. Investors also benefited in 2021 from the easing of fiscal and monetary policies. Unlike 2021, its expected that performance in 2022 will be reliant on profit growth. Although the COVID-19 mutations continue to pose a threat, and geopolitical tensions continue to rise, we remain cautiously optimistic at Markaz, and reliant on our sustainable and solid business model. We will continue to explore ideal investment opportunities with the aim of delivering added value to our clients.” Alghanim stated. Investment Climate “The support provided by regulatory and supervisory authorities was essential to the recovery and progress of the financial sector, since the procedures imposed in April 2020 by the Central Bank of Kuwait contributed to the stability of the financial system and supported the financial services’ sector, allowing it to overcome the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout 2021, the Central Bank of Kuwait launched a series of campaigns, including the ‘Diraya’ campaign, an awareness campaign aimed at educating customers about their banking rights, in addition to the ‘Kafa’a’ initiative, which aims at building highly qualified national cadres and equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary to develop the banking sector. These initiatives will have a positive impact in the future, as awareness campaigns in the financial sector play an important role in the development of the nation as a whole and the its financial services. The Capital Markets Authority efforts also played a crucial role throughout the years to develop the Kuwaiti Capital Market in line with international standards. Moreover, Boursa Kuwait has developed an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Reporting Guide that aims to support listed companies in determining and adopting best ESG practices and reporting on (ESG) issues, to meet the growing interest in adopting and applying corporate sustainability and sustainable investments in the recent years.” Alghanim concluded. Mr. Ali Hassan. Khalil, Markaz CEO also commented saying: “2021 was a phenomenal year for global stock markets, which witnessed to date the highest levels of mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs worldwide.

Markaz MIDAF Fund, Forsa Financial Fund, and Markaz Mumtaz Fund each recorded return of 28.3%, 27.6%, and 26.2% respectively. Markaz Islamic Fund, in accordance with provisions of Islamic Sharia, recorded returns of 24.8%. Reaffirming its leading position in the Capital Markets as a whole, and the Kuwaiti Capital Market in specific, Markaz proceeded to offer its specialized services in market making with the aim of increasing the volume of trading, hence boosting the trading of its clients’ shares in Boursa Kuwait. Throughout 2021, Markaz was Market Maker on the shares of five leading companies within their fields. International Real Estate Markaz executed several deals that contributed to the growth of its real estate portfolio. These investments mainly focused on the logistics sector in the USA and Europe, in addition to the residential sector in the USA. Moreover; Markaz succeeded in identifying the ideal time to exit specific deals which contributed to enriching its track record in these markets. One of the key exit deals was the sale of a logistics project to Amazon in Germany. MENA Real Estate Occupancy levels in Markaz’s real estate projects in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have exceeded the pre-pandemic levels, which resulted in growth in income from rental deals during the year. Sales efforts across the main residential properties within the company’s portfolio in the UAE continued with solid and growing momentum in 2021. Markaz’s Real Estate Fund maintained high occupancy and collection levels, by adopting a pragmatic integrated approach to the day-to-day management of assets, despite the effects of the pandemic on some sectors, such as the residential, office and retail sector. Investment Banking Services Markaz managed to conclude four deals in the Capital Markets field, including two issuances of second tier bonds of two banks, and two deals for subscription in rights issues. In addition, Markaz executed a range of consultancy deals in the food and beverage, construction, insurance, and technology sectors.

"SEOUL-- Kyobo Life Insurance Co. on Thursday said the country's bourse operator will begin a preliminary assessment of its initial public offering (IPO).

The Korea Exchange (KRX) has said it will launch a panel to review the IPO bid of South Korea's No. 2 life insurer eight months after its filing.

Kyobo Life has been pushing to go public since 2018, but opposition from its shareholders has halted the process for years.

Kyobo Life Chairman and the largest stakeholder Shin Chang-jae, as well as those with special interests in the company, hold a combined 36.9 percent stake.

If the IPO is successful, Kyobo Life will begin preparing for the introduction of a new accounting rule for insurance products in 2023.

"SEOUL-- ONE store Co., a South Korean mobile app market platform, decided Wednesday to withdraw its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) due to lackluster investor confidence, financial industry sources said.

The No. 2 mobile app market operator here, after Google Play store, received lackluster response from institutional investors during a two-day demand forecasting session until Tuesday, according to the sources. Institutional bids reportedly mostly fell below the company's desired pricing band between 34,300 won ($27) and 41,700 won.

""Just this morning, ONE store considered going public by lowering the desired price, but they apparently decided to scrap the plan after concluding the company's value may not be properly recognized by the market under the current stock market situation,"" a source said.

ONE store's affiliate SK shieldus also nixed its IPO plan last week due to weak investor sentiment.

Lee Jae-hwan, CEO of ONE store, said in a press conference on Monday that the company was determined to get listed on the main bourse as planned this month, undeterred by the sister company's derailed attempt.

ONE store is the latest among several South Korean companies that have backpedaled on IPO plans so far this year. In late January, Hyundai Engineering Co., the construction arm of Hyundai Motor Group, withdrew its plan to get its stocks listed on the country's main bourse due to adverse market conditions.

ONE store logged 214 billion won in sales last year and an operating loss of 5.8 billion won. The company racked up 1.13 trillion won worth of transactions on its platform last year.

Its market share in the local mobile app market stands at some 14 percent, with Google Play's presence coming in at 71.9 percent.

"SEOUL-- SK shieldus Co., a security arm of South Korean telecom giant SK Telecom Co., is expected to raise up to 3.55 trillion won (US$2.85 billion) through a planned initial public offering (IPO) next month.

The listing, set for May 19, will mark the biggest ever market debut by a security service provider, more than the value of its rival firm S-1 Corp., a security firm under Samsung Group.

""Our company integrated cybersecurity and physical security services. SK shieldus should not be compared with S-1 by one-to-one,"" CEO Park Jin-hyo said at an online conference.

SK shieldus, which changed its name from ADT Caps Co. last October, currently provides security services across four main categories -- cybersecurity, convergence security, physical security, and safety and care.

Last year, the company reported 1.55 trillion won in sales, trailing behind 2.31 trillion won recorded by S-1.

Park said the company aims to take over other security companies with higher technical skills following the IPO, and hire more personnel with expertise in platform.

SK shieldus said it set the IPO price range of 31,000-38,800 won.

Credit Suisse, the lead bookrunner, Morgan Stanley, KB Securities and NH Investment and Securities began taking orders from investors.

Demand forecasting for domestic institutions is slated for May 3 and May 4, with that for retail investors set to take place on May 9 and May 10.

"SEOUL-- SK On Co. is not considering an initial public offering (IPO) for at least another two to three years but will build up its competitiveness and enhance corporate value before pushing for a market debut, head of its parent company said Thursday.

The potential listing of SK On has drawn attention since the battery unit was spun off from SK Innovation in October last year, as part of SK's push to bolster the battery business amid growing demand from global automakers vying for a bigger share in the electric vehicle market.

""What's the most important for an IPO to take place is that we need to have our battery business recognized in the market,"" Kim Jun, CEO and vice chairman of SK Innovation Co., told reporters after a general shareholders meeting.

""I expect that we should be able to deliver the performance, in terms of sales, profitability and stable management of equipment, after 2025, and I believe it would be after 2025 if we were to do an IPO,"" he said.

Its bigger rival, LG Energy Solution Ltd., set a record IPO in January that made the battery maker the second-largest company in South Korea by market cap, reflecting the global electrification trend.

Kim said SK On is at the pre-IPO stage to raise funds from investors in advance of going public.

""We need large-scale resources as we are continuing with the facility expansion ... We plan to sign the contracts (on the investments) in the first half,"" Kim said.

Industry sources predict SK On is seeking to raise between 3 and 5 trillion won (US$2.47-4.12 billion), which amounts to about a 10 percent stake in the company.

Kim forecast SK On will swing to the black in the fourth quarter of this year and achieve an annual surplus from next year. SK Innovation's battery business logged an operating loss of 683.1 billion won in the fourth quarter of last year.

In light of any possible advance into new businesses, Kim said he is looking at areas of ""non-carbon, or low-carbon energy sources,"" and discussing various ideas with SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, without elaborating further.

Earlier this month, Chey hinted at ""drawing up a new business map that incorporates energy and environment"" during a visit to a SK Innovation factory in a southwestern city.

"SEOUL– The amount of money South Korean firms raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) more than quadrupled to hit a record high last year thanks to ample liquidity and the overall bullish stock market sentiment, data showed Monday.

A total of 89 companies went public in 2021 by listing stocks on the benchmark KOSPI and secondary tech-heavy KOSDAQ markets and raised a combined 19.7 trillion won (US$16.4 billion), according to the data from the Financial Supervisory Service.

The money raised from IPOs represented a 333.9 percent surge from 4.5 trillion won a year earlier, the data showed. The number of companies whose shares listed on the stock markets for the first time also jumped from the previous year’s 70.

The IPO market was driven by the overall rise in local stock markets and ample liquidity injected into the economy bolstered by low borrowing costs in line with record low policy rates intended to boost the pandemic-hit economy.

Investors got more interested in new stock listings, with the competition ratio for IPO stocks jumping to an average of 1,136 to 1 last year, up from the 956-to-1 ratio a year earlier.

The prices of newly listed stocks closed 57.4 percent higher on average on their first trading day, compared with their IPO prices. The return marked the highest in five years, the data showed.

Their average prices also jumped 54.8 percent at the end of last year from the IPO prices. But of the companies that went private, 28 firms, or 31.5 percent, saw their stocks fall below the IPO prices at the end of last year, the data showed.

"KUALA LUMPUR: Global initial public offering (IPO) saw its year-to-date (YTD) volumes fall 46 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) to 630 IPOs, with proceeds shrinking 58 per cent y-o-y to US$95.4 billion (US$1=RM4.44), as heightened volatility caused by geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic factors, declining valuation and poor post-IPO share price performance led to the postponement of many IPOs.

In a statement today, EY Initial Public Offering Services said for the second quarter of 2022 (Q2 2022), the global IPO market recorded 305 deals raising US$40.6 billion in proceeds, down 54 per cent and 65 per cent y-o-y, respectively.

It said during the period under review, the energy sector had replaced the technology sector as the top IPO fundraiser, whereby among the top 10 largest IPOs by proceeds which raised US$40 billion, energy dominated three of the top four deals, replacing the technology sector.

“The technology sector continued to lead by number, but the average IPO deal size came down to US$137 million from US$293 million, whereas energy has overtaken to lead by proceeds with average deal size increasing to US$680 million from US$191 million,“ it said.

Regionally, EY said the IPO activity in the Americas region saw the sharpest decline (among all regions) in Q2 2022 versus Q2 2021, with deals decreasing 73 per cent y-o-y to 41 IPOs, and proceeds falling 95 per cent y-o-y to US$2.5 billion.

However, it said compared with Q1 2022, the number of deals and proceeds in the region were up 14 per cent y-o-y and six per cent y-o-y, respectively.

For the ASEAN region, it said YTD, the grouping registered a total of 54 IPOs raising US$2.4 billion, down two per cent y-o-y in the number of deals and 55 per cent y-o-y in proceeds.

“The notable decline in proceeds was due to a lack of mega IPOs (IPOs with proceeds equal to or greater than US$1 billion) YTD 2022, compared to three mega IPOs in YTD 2021 that raised US$3.9 billion,“ it said.

It unveiled that the most active ASEAN exchanges were Indonesia (22 IPOs raising US$1.3 billion), Thailand (13 IPOs; US$300 million), and Philippines (seven IPOs; US$300 million), followed by Malaysia (six IPOs; US$500 million) and Singapore (six IPOs raising US$33 million).

For Asia-Pacific, EY said the region finished the quarter with a 42 per cent y-o-y decline in proceeds and 37 per cent y-o-y decline in deals.

“The region saw 181 IPOs raising US$ 23.3 billion in proceeds during Q2 and 367 IPOs raising US$66.0 billion in proceeds YTD 2022. However, Asia-Pacific markets performed relatively better benefitting from the two largest global IPOs YTD,“ it said.

On outlook for Q3 2022, EY believes that uncertainties and volatility are likely to remain, including geopolitical strains, macroeconomic factors, weak capital market performance, and the impact from the lingering pandemic on global travel and related sectors.

Nonetheless, it noted that there were many mega IPOs postponed in the first half of 2022, which represents a healthy pipeline of deals that are likely to come to the market when the current uncertainties and volatility subside.

It said the technology sector is also likely to continue as the leading sector in terms of the number of deals coming to the market.

“However, with a greater focus on renewable sources of energy in the face of increasing oil prices, the energy sector is expected to continue to lead by proceeds from bigger deals,“ it said, adding that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) will continue to be a sector-agnostic key theme for investors and IPO candidates. - Bernama",Date,2022-07-15,"Global IPO activity falls 46 pct, proceeds shrink 58 pct ytd 2022: EY","[KUALA, EY Initial Public Offering Services, EY, ASEAN, ASEAN, ESG],[]",https://ipo.einnews.com/article/581385516?lcf=OCDoEYEqDerAgfzLAbKEdQ%3D%3D

Taiwan-based edge AI company Gorilla Technology Group has completed the business combination with Global SPAC Partners and began trading on the Nasdaq on July 14 with the ticker ""GRRR.""

On the first day of the initial public offering (IPO), the share of Gorilla went up 123.61% to close at US$33.43, reflecting the market's recognition of its global competitiveness in edge video analytic artificial intelligence, IoT technologies, and cybersecurity.

The company's press release announced that the business combination will provide cash, including funds from Global SPAC Partners' trust account and $41.9 million from PIPE subscriptions. Pursuant to the amended subscription agreements of May 18, 2022, PIPE investors exercised their option to purchase $11.6 million of the subunits subscribed for via purchases in the open market, representing 8.9% of the pre-merger outstanding subunits, and which were not redeemed at the closing of the business combination. The proceeds will be used for working capital, business growth, international expansion, and other general corporate purposes.

"German automaker Volkswagen AG's VWAGY PowerCo global battery manufacturing business, which it plans to plan to spin-off in an initial public offering in 2023, is facing the impact of supply chain challenges, Bloomberg reported.

What Happened: PowerCo is scouting sources for securing raw materials for the plant amid rising input prices and logistical challenges, the report said, citing Kai Alexander Mueller, CFO of the unit.

The report noted that the company plans to tie up with Belgium-based miner Umicore SA UMICY for sourcing cathode materials, Robert Bosch for machinery and Vulcan Energy Resources Limited VULNF for battery-grade lithium hydroxide.

PowerCo began work on its first European plant last week and also disclosed plans to invest over 20 billion euros ($20.06 billion) in five proposed battery manufacturing plants.

The German automaker suggested in June that it is open to an IPO of the unit, with contributions from both internal and external strategic partners. A potential listing could occur in 2023 or 2024, Volkswagen's CFO Arno Antlitz had said, according to Bloomberg.

Benzinga's Take: Volkswagen's quest to vertically integrate into batteries reflects its efforts to reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which nearly monopolize the industry.

The time might not be apt, given the surrounding macroeconomic uncertainty and supply chain issues. The move, however, is likely to be a long-term positive and a strategic one, given the importance of batteries in electric vehicle manufacturing.

Price Action: Volkswagen shares trading over the counter in the U.S. fell 2.25% to $17.83 in Thursday's session, according to Benzinga Pro data.

A couple of taxis using Kakao Mobility’s ride-hailing service Kakao T wait for passengers in front of Seoul station on June 28. (Yonhap)A dispute between Kakao Corp. management and its labor union is growing over the IT giant’s rumored attempt to sell its transportation service subsidiary Kakao Mobility to private equity firm MBK Partners. Kakao’s labor union on Wednesday accused the management of giving up on its mobility business, questioning if the sell-off to the private equity fund can help the business grow.According to the union’s statement, Kakao Corp. said its mobility platform cannot grow anymore under its wing, and that the IT giant has no intention of continuing with the mobility business. It added that Kakao’s management said the sale was necessary for the business to expand. The union sees the sale of Kakao Mobility as an attempt to prevent Kakao founder Kim Beom-su from being asked to appear at the National Assembly’s state audit this year. It said it would resume collecting signatures from Kakao Corp. employees for a petition, which was launched in June when rumors of a sale first began swirling, to oppose the deal. Shortly after the union’s statement was released, Bae Jae-hyun, the company’s chief investment officer, downplayed the sale rumors. He said in an internal notice that the company has never considered an entire sell-off.“What we are considering is changing Kakao’s stake in (Kakao Mobility) to become the second-largest shareholder by selling (a 10-19 percent stake),” he said. This suggests MBK would also buy shares from other owners to become the largest shareholder. Kakao Corp. owns a 57.5 percent stake in Kakao Mobility while a consortium led by US private equity firm TPG holds a 29 percent stake and the Carlyle Group has a 6.2 percent stake.The CIO added that the company is contemplating how Kakao Mobility can grow bigger beyond Kakao Corp.’s boundaries, saying no decisions had been made. The union last month met with the IT giant’s leadership including Kim Sung-su, chairman of the board of directors, to oppose the sale.Kakao Mobility went into turmoil after June 14 when it was reported that MBK Partners -- one of the largest private equity firms in Asia -- was in talks with the IT giant to buy a 40 percent stake in Kakao Mobility, which was valued at 8.5 trillion won ($6.6 billion).   Despite Kakao Corp.’s explanation that nothing was decided at the time, the sudden news sparked outcry from employees, as the company even had picked underwriters in March to go public on the Korea Exchange this year. Kakao’s labor union then began collecting signatures of employees and staged protests to oppose the sale of Kakao Mobility. The union denounced Kakao Corp.’s leadership for reneging on its promise to undergo an initial public offering. Previous IPOs of Kakao subsidiaries have included stock options for employees.Prospects of a stock listing have faded due to weak market conditions and damage to the corporation’s image after Kakao Pay executives dumped shares in the company in December last year. The executives, including Ryu Young-joon, CEO of Kakao Corp.’s mobile payment unit, exercised their stock options to sell company shares only a month after Kakao Pay’s listing, reaping a windfall of almost 90 billion won.“Kakao pulled out the sell-off card just three months after it had vowed to carry out shareholder-friendly policies. Isn’t the company trying to retrieve its investment in a different way as the option of going public is likely blocked?” said the union. A staffer at one of Kakao Corp.’s subsidiaries told The Korea Herald that Kakao Mobility employees have been feeling “uneasy” as the direction of the company is now unclear. “We don’t know too much about what’s going on with the rumored sell-off. We just hope things become clear soon,” said the staffer who requested anonymity. Kakao Corp. is under pressure to resolve things one way or another, as an IPO this year was among the conditions of the minority shareholders’ investments in Kakao Mobility. It is almost certain that there would be penalty clauses for failing to list, such as a requirement to buy back shares at an elevated price or to engage in a joint sale to a third party.But with the stock market in freefall, MBK Partners will be in no hurry to complete the acquisition, according to an analyst at a local private equity firm. “The value of technology stocks has decreased, so I think it is unlikely (for MBK Partners) to buy (Kakao Mobility) at the value of 8.5 trillion won. MBK Partners has no reason to go for that price at the moment,” he said. The analyst noted that MBK Partners will also consider tag-along rights of TPG and the Carlyle Group during negotiations with Kakao Corp. Tag-along rights allow minority shareholders to sell their shares if a majority shareholder is negotiating a stake sale. If MBK Partners were to acquire a 40 percent stake from Kakao Corp. as well as all shares owned by TPG and the Carlyle Group, it would approximately cost 6.4 trillion won. “Such a large deal could put some burden on MBK Partners, so won’t they try to push the price further down?” the analyst said. Since the second half of last year, Kakao Mobility has been under fire for hiking ride-hailing fees and expanding into new business areas to provide designated driver services, quick delivery and parcel delivery. The mobility application operator faced heat from the public as its expanded services drove small merchants and business owners out of work.  An IT industry source told The Korea Herald that the sale of Kakao Mobility could give Kakao Corp. some breathing room. “Kakao’s public image has worsened over the past year and Kakao Mobility was one of the major reasons behind that. So I think Kakao might want to detach itself from the mobility business. If a deal is made, it would give Kakao instant cash,” the source said. After Kakao Mobility began as a spinoff subsidiary from Kakao Corp. in 2017, it quickly became the country’s largest mobility platform service provider. Kakao Mobility has 30 million cumulative users and 10 million monthly active users, as of July.The company recorded annual sales of 546 billion won last year, almost doubling from 2020, and posted operating profits of 12.5 billion won to be in the black for the first time.By Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)

Advertisement for Toss Bank`s savings account(Toss Bank)Saving money is never fun. But when combined with a digital pet that grows alongside the size of your savings, it can be more motivating. South Korea’s three internet-only banks -- KakaoBank, K bank and Toss Bank -- have launched unique products such as Tamagotchi-like savings accounts, mobile joint accounts and digital piggy banks to lure customers attracted to the trends. Toss Bank, launched in October last year, has registered 3.6 million users in just eight months through a slew of unique savings products and digital-friendly services. One of them is a Tamagotchi-like savings account in which a user can see a randomly selected digital pet -- turtle, octopus, colt or ghost -- grow with deposits for six months. The digital pet idea has been met with booming demand, as Toss opened 100,000 new accounts within 72 hours of its launch on June 14. Users can deposit a maximum 1 million won ($773) per month for a total of six months with a yield of 3 percent. “The act of saving money requires time and patience, and we wanted to change that time into a fun experience of raising a cute pet for our users,” Toss Bank CEO Hong Min-take told reporters at a media event in Seoul on Tuesday. Toss Bank also plans to launch a joint mobile account “soon,” Hong added, which will cater to friends and groups seeking to split the bill for their favorite activities. The nation’s No. 1 internet-only bank by users, KakaoBank -- with 19.13 million users -- has rolled out various accounts and services tied to its sister company and top mobile messenger KakaoTalk. In this sense, 11.39 million users had opened one of its joint accounts as of May. KakaoTalk currently has some 45 million monthly active users in a country of about 51 million.Its short-term 26-week savings account, a rare product here, was met with high demand upon its launch on June 21, registering 150,000 new accounts within 72 hours. The bank’s piggy bank services are also a key product, allowing users to make deposits of less than 1,000 won on its mobile account daily. The bank managed some 4.35 million piggy bank accounts as of the end of April. K bank is somewhat behind its two rivals in providing unique services, but it is the only mobile bank here providing a real-name account for cryptocurrency trading. Its partnership with local crypto exchange Upbit, signed in June 2020, has helped more than triple its users from 2.19 million in 2020 to some 7 million as of end-2021. K bank’s initial public offering plans, which have been stalled for years, have been gaining pace with the firm filing for a preliminary review for listing on the Korean market with the Korea Exchange on Thursday. Its IPO is predicted to be valued at at least 6 trillion won and the firm is forecast to debut in November, according to market watchers. Korea’s internet-only banks have been expanding quickly in recent years, backed by an increase in the use of smartphones and keeping traditional lenders on their toes with user-friendly services. KakaoBank’s earnings jumped about 80 percent on-year in 2021, with net income amounting to 204.12 billion won, according to a regulatory filing. Operating profit more than doubled over the cited period to 256.94 billion won, and sales also expanded 32.4 percent on-year to 1.06 trillion won.K bank recorded a net profit of 22.4 billion won last year, swinging into the black from a net loss of 105.4 billion won the previous year. Toss Bank, being relatively new to the market, has yet to release its earnings. Its total loans stood at some 4 trillion won as of last month, with 36 percent being taken out by low- and mid-rated customers.(mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

(Kakao Pay)Kakao Pay employees who own shares in their own company each lost an average 20 million won ($15,600) due to the mobile payment firm’s stock price plunge since January, reports said Sunday. The company’s employee stock ownership association purchased a total 3.4 million shares in Kakao Pay at the price of 90,000 won per share prior to its initial public offering on Nov. 3 last year, according to a regulatory filing. Documents show that some 800 employees received an average 4,005 shares each, valued at 360.4 million won at the time of the firm’s market debut. It had set the IPO price at 90,000 won per share, opened at the price of 180,000 won and closed higher at 193,000 won on its first day.But Kakao Pay employees have each lost some 20 million won after the company’s share price plunged over a slew of risks since January, the reports said. The mobile payment operator hit a 52-week-low in terms of closing price on Friday with 85,100, closing 3.73 percent lower from the previous session.Kakao Pay shares lost its rally after it was found in January that former CEO Ryu Young-joon and seven other executives offloaded 90 billion won of company shares by exercising stock option in December, only a month after the company went public. Furthermore, the firm’s second-largest shareholder Alipay dumped 5 million shares -- about 10 percent of the total stake it holds in Kakao Pay -- in a block deal, sending the payment platform operator’s price down 15.57 percent from the previous closing to 89,500 won on Wednesday. Alipay remains the second-largest shareholder, with a 34.72 percent stake in the Korean firm. Members of Kakao Pay’s employee stock ownership association are legally obligated to keep their shares until Nov. 3 this year, a year since the firm’s IPO launch. (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

Graphs showing the change in stock price for Kakao, Kakao Pay and KakaoBank (The Korea Herald)Kakao Pay shares tumbled Wednesday morning after it was reported that its second-largest shareholder Alipay was looking to sell 5 million shares -- about 10 percent of the total stake it holds in Kakao Pay -- in a block deal. The stock price of Kakao Pay fell 15.57 percent to close at 89,500 won. Despite the sell-off, the payment arm of IT giant Kakao said Alipay will continue to be a strategic investor and remain the second-largest shareholder, with 34.72 percent of Kakao Pay shares, and the two sides will carry on with their strong partnership. Experts, however, said this could be the beginning of an ugly turn of events. An analyst at a local securities firm told The Korea Herald that the risk of overhang remains with Alipay’s block deal. “Alipay holds a lot more Kakao Pay shares, so it could sell some of the remaining amount or more. This possibility of dumping off shares has a negative impact for other shareholders as it was seen in today’s price drop,” the analyst said. Park Sang-hyun, an insight provider at independent investment research network Smartkarma, pointed out that Alipay’s return on its Kakao Pay investment is 10 times, so it may be natural to realize a profit to some extent. “But the local market believes that the strategic partnership is cracking, starting with this stake sale. It is highly likely that Alipay will go through a multiphased stake sale process,” Park added. The sharp drop in Kakao Pay’s stock price marked the latest hiccup in a series of disappointments for Kakao Group in the past nine months.In June 2021, Kakao Group became South Korea’s fifth-largest business group in terms of market capitalization at 79.3 trillion won ($65.1 billion), behind the country’s traditional conglomerates: Samsung, SK, LG and Hyundai Motor Group. About a month later, Kakao founder Kim Beom-su was ranked as the richest person in the country by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His net worth was estimated at $13.4 billion. The report said Kim was an exemplary case of how a self-made entrepreneur could succeed in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, which has long been dominated by its family-controlled conglomerates.The tech giant, which rose to prominence with its messenger app KakaoTalk, climbed up the ladder through aggressive expansion of businesses. At the end of the first half of 2021, Kakao had over 150 subsidiaries and affiliates in and out of the country. However, the platform behemoth’s heyday did not last long. The company -- once touted for the legendary tale of its self-made entrepreneur founder and the success of technological innovation in the 21st century -- has undergone a series of blunders and setbacks in recent months. In September, Kakao’s people-friendly image first faced criticism over the company’s rapid expansion, said to have driven small merchants out of business. That led to Kakao’s pledge to pull back some of the company’s services in industries such as snacks and flower delivery.To avert public criticism, Kakao vowed to create a fund of 300 billion won to support small firms and the self-employed, but its misfortunes continued.In the same month, the founder’s investment company K Cube Holdings -- the de facto holding company of Kakao -- was accused of having private interests as well as the illegal succession of family members in employment. More allegations piled on, as K Cube Holdings was accused of fabricating regulatory documents.Kim later apologized at a National Assembly state audit, saying the investment company would change to be committed to social responsibilities.A series of megasized initial public offering deals that further raised Kakao’s market profile, ironically, exposed the root cause for its downfall.A mass sale of Kakao Pay shares by executives including Ryu Young-joon, the then-appointee for Kakao’s next co-CEO, struck the company hard in January.Ryu, who was CEO of Kakao’s mobile payment unit Kakao Pay, was found to have exercised his stock option to sell company shares in December, only a month after the company’s listing. Through this, he and several senior executives collected a total profit of almost 90 billion won, with Ryu taking about half of the gains. Kakao saw fierce backlash from the company’s labor union, retail investors and the general public as the executives raked in massive profits at the expense of investors. Combined with the group’s hasty expansion that had hit small businesses last year, the irresponsible money-making decision raised concerns over whether the IT group could maintain accountable corporate governance. Kakao released an apology, vowing to ban CEOs and executives at its subsidiaries from selling company shares within one to two years after being listed on the market through setting up a new control tower. In March, Kim resigned from his chairman post of the board of directors, leaving behind ailing stock prices and loss of trust among investors.   Kakao’s stock price, which hit as high as 169,500 won per share at the close of June 23, 2021, has halved to a little over 80,000 won per share almost a year later. The stock prices of Kakao Pay and KakaoBank have also suffered similar or worse downfalls, losing trillions of won in the process. On top of losing confidence from the market, the IT giant has irked its own crew.Last week, Kakao unveiled its new “metaverse” working system where employees could basically work wherever they want. The seemingly future-oriented scheme, however, was met with internal resistance from employees, as the new system would require being connected online through a voice channel at all times. Kakao workers expressed concerns and discontent on an in-house online community space, saying the new policy was as an attempt to spy on employees. Kakao CEO Namkoong Whon later said in an announcement to staff that being connected to the voice channel would be decided by crew members in different groups or work areas, but did not scrap the plan. Regarding the implementation of a mandatory working time from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., he said the company will reconsider the plan through communication with staff. Without working on mending ties with stakeholders in and out of the company, Kakao instead unveiled its new vision, “Kakao Universe,” on Tuesday, saying it wants to go beyond Korea. The CEO said they will look to reach 5 billion people across the world through open links that connect them based on their interests instead of targeting South Korea’s 50 million domestic users. But if Kakao cannot redeem itself as the people-friendly company it once was with the rise of its dominant messenger app, experts say it will be difficult for the company to win back people’s hearts and bounce back. “I think Kakao’s stock prices are not doing well due to its subsidiaries going public. Naver has only one entity in the bourse, but Kakao’s other firms have been listed and this has cemented Kakao’s image as a firm that conducts (IPOs) to sell shares to make money,” an analyst at a local private equity firm told The Korea Herald. “Kakao’s growth has been done through mergers and acquisitions, as well as some unethical moves such as taking the business of small merchants. Its corporate governance is also seemingly abominable,” he added.By Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)

Corporate logo of Millie’s Library (Millie’s Library)Millie’s Library, one of South Korea’s largest e-book subscription platform, said Sunday that it is set for a market debut by the end of this year.The company filed a preliminary prospectus on Friday stating that it will offer 2 million common shares out of the total 8,234,901 shares. If the initial public offering process goes as planned, it will be the country’s first e-book platform to go public.Its shares are poised to start trading on the Korea Exchange’s secondary Kosdaq. The lead manager of the envisioned IPO is Mirae Asset Securities.The corporate value of Millie’s Library is estimated to be around 300 billion won ($239 million), according to market insiders.With funds raised from the IPO, the company plans to invest in the production of original book content as well as other content.The company’s sales revenue surged on-year by 61 percent to 28.9 billion won last year. However, it posted an operating loss of 34.8 billion won, and has still not turned a profit.Millie’s Library has been seeking to accelerate growth momentum after it was acquired by Genie Music, the music streaming platform under KT, in 2021. Genie Music currently holds 39 percent of the shares of the company.Working with the KT artificial intelligence business unit, the e-book platform plans to create synergy with an AI-based audio platform to produce more content, including audiobooks.Last year, Seo Young-taek, CEO of Millie’s Library, said if the company’s intellectual property-based business model is well received, its value will exceed the 500 billion won of Radish, the US webtoon platform acquired by Kakao Entertainment. In the long term, the company looks to achieve more than 1 trillion won in value, Seo added.But concerns loom over the e-book platform’s debut amid a lackluster IPO market and an ongoing slump in platform giants such as Naver and Kakao, industry sources said. Naver’s stock price has traded below 300,000 won since late April, while Kakao is also showing sluggish movement between 80,000 and 90,000 won in the citied period.“The company has grown exponentially to become the country’s largest online library platform in just six years. Based on our vision -- ‘become friends with an unlimited number of books’ -- we will expand the presence in the book content market,” Seo said in a statement. Launched in 2017, Millie’s Library services 110,000 e-books through 1,400 publishers as of May. The company is the first here to provide an e-book subscription service. It produces audiobooks, “chat books,” which are books re-created in a chatting format, and audio dramas.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

Hyundai Card headquarters in Seoul (Hyundai Card)Taiwanese banking giant Fubon Financial on Friday raised its stake in South Korea’s Hyundai Card to nearly 20 percent, expanding its clout over management of the card issuer. Fubon Financial is now the card issuer’s third-largest shareholder with 19.98 percent after Hyundai Motor with 36.96 percent and Hyundai Commercial with 28.56 percent. Kia Corp. is the fourth-largest stakeholder with 11.48 percent. The latest announcement puts a final stamp on the exit of a consortium led by Hong Kong-based private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners from the card issuer, which previously owned a 24 percent threshold. Since last year, Affinity had sold its some 20 percent stake to Fubon Financial’s commercial banking unit Fubon Bank and life insurer Fubon Life Insurance for roughly 520 billion won ($409 million). The remaining 4 percent stake was sold to Hyundai Commercial. The move comes four years after the consortium bought the same number of shares for 380 billion won. It also effectively nullifies the Affinity’s initial request made in 2017 for Hyundai Card to complete its initial public offering within four years of the stake purchase, indefinitely delaying the possible listing. “There are no immediate plans for an IPO,” Hyundai Card said in a statement in the day. Early this year, Hyundai Card’s two outside directors from Affinity left their posts to be replaced by Douglas Tsai, management associate at Fubon Financial Holding. The company is expected to fill the vacant post with another Fubon official. “Fubon Financial has highly regarded Hyundai Card’s potential to further grow as a private label credit card issuer alongside our data science and branding skills as our strategic investor,” the card issuer said in a statement. A private label credit card is a credit card that offers more benefits for use at a specific brand‘s stores. Fubon Financial was founded in 1961 with multiple subsidiaries including Fubon Life, Taipei Fubon Bank, Fubon Securities, Fubon Asset Management and more. As of the end of 2021, Fubon Financial Holdings had unaudited net assets of $10.51 trillion. At the end of 2015, Fubon Life purchased a 48 percent stake in Hyundai Life Insurance, to rebrand it as Fubon Hyundai Life.Hyundai Card’s net profit in the first three months of this year declined 4 percent on-year to 76.9 billion won, according to regulatory filing.By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

A promotional image of One Store app store (One Store)South Korea’s homegrown mobile app store operator One Store has dropped its plan to go public amid poor stock market conditions, the company said Wednesday.One Store’s decision comes a day after a book building of institutional investors wrapped up, in which the offering price of a common share was below its suggested price band, at between 34,300 won ($26.9) and 41,700 won apiece. The figures have estimated One Store’s equity value at between 910 billion won and 1.1 trillion won. The decision came in contrast with the company officials’ pledge to proceed with the IPO at all costs, as expressed in a press conference Monday. Officials including Chief Executive Officer Lee Jae-hwan touted One Store as a challenger in the app store market globally dominated by Google and Apple. One Store said in a statement the decision is attributable to “heightening macroeconomic uncertainties that sapped investor sentiment in the stock market,” despite “positive feedback on the company fundamentals” by institutional investors.One Store’s announcement marks the sixth of its kind, following companies including its sister company SK Shieldus and corrugated cardboard maker Tailim Paper.One Store’s shareholders include Korean internet giant Naver, US tech giant Microsoft and Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, in addition to SK Square.Accordingly, its parent SK Square is pressured to change courses from its plan to enhance corporate value through a soft landing of its subsidiaries on the stock market. SK Shieldus, a security services subsidiary of the investment body, also withdrew its bid to go public on Friday. The decision, combined with One Store’s case, is casting a shadow on SK Square’s plan to list more subsidiaries including e-commerce arm 11st. SK Square’s share price hit yet another all-time low. Its shares fell 3.25 percent Wednesday. The market cap of SK Square nearly halved to 6.3 trillion won from the highest point in late November, as soon as the company was spun off from Korea’s largest mobile carrier SK Telecom.

President Yoon Suk-yeol at the National Assembly. (Yonhap)The Yoon Suk-yeol government is looking to make it easier for “vulnerable groups” to take out loans to follow through on his campaign promise, while offering better protection to consumers from predatory lending and unfair corporate practices.The groups refer to self-employed people, small business owners, first-time home buyers and those fresh out of college who the government says need more financial support than all the others. COVID fallout and runaway housing prices have put them in greater focus.“We have yet to receive a clear directive on details but given what’s been said so far, we expect expanding support for the financially challenged groups,” an official at the Financial Services Commission said.The official was referring to Yoon’s “Target 110,” an agenda laying out 110 goals Yoon has given priority. Yoon’s office revealed it last week ahead of Yoon’s swearing in on Tuesday.Financial authorities are preparing concrete steps, such as offering more favorable interest rates, rolling over maturing loans and reducing debts for the self-employed and small businesses to help them recoup losses caused by COVID-19.For first-time home buyers and those seeking to open and expand their savings account from their first job, the government is considering partially easing a long set of mortgage rules and allowing more favorable terms on the savings accounts.Meanwhile, the Yoon government is expected to put a greater check on banks seeking to inflate interest rates -- a complaint consumers have long filed with authorities.Financial services companies would also face a higher burden of proof for any security breaches that violate consumers’ interests, according to authorities. Banks have long been accused of shifting the burden of proof to consumers or regulators to reduce damages to pay.Authorities added that they will deal with unfair corporate practices, referring to a contentious spinoff LG Chem carried out and the stock options row at Kakao Pay, which all took place in January this year.Individual investors holding shares in LG Chem, which wholly owned LG Energy Solution before the world’s second-largest battery maker went public in what was Korea’s record listing, cried foul over the lack of regulation for what they saw as a corporate practice that unfairly diluted their share value. A similar spinoff also took place to float Kakao Pay, a payment arm of Korea’s leading chat app operator Kakao Corp., which is one of the two internet giants along with Naver.But it was a stock price fall that brought down the CEO at Kakao Pay, where the senior management including the CEO exercised stock options a month after the initial public offering, causing what investors called an “unwarranted dip” in stock prices. The bourse operator have had to roll out rules to oversee spinoff IPOs done by large-cap companies and lockup periods on executives looking to offload shares following an IPO, when shares could potentially run higher than expected on investor optimism. Such rule change is one of many to come to level the playing field for consumers, authorities said.By Choi Si-young (siyoungchoi@heraldcorp.com)

One Store CEO Lee Jae-hwan delivers a presentation at a press conference in Seoul, Monday. (One Store)South Korea’s homegrown app marketplace One Store aims to challenge Google and Apple, two US tech giants that enjoy a near-monopoly in the whopping 300 trillion won ($235 billion) app store market globally, with its forthcoming stock market debut here. One Store, the nation’s sole operator of an app store of the same name, is a merged entity of the nation’s four app stores that was previously operated separately by SK Telecom, KT, LG Uplus and Naver. Now it is an affiliate of SK Square, SK Group’s investment unit.In its push for global expansion, it plans to secure a footing first in Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan by the end of this year, and then Europe and North America in the long run. “Korea is the only app store market in the world which made its way out of an app store monopoly,” One Store Chief Executive Officer Lee Jae-hwan told a news conference in Seoul Monday. “To the global market, One Store is close to being among the only options, given the time and cost it takes for a country to create a new app store from scratch.”Lee cited an estimate by IGAWorks Mobile Index that showed One Store beat Apple with 13.8 percent of market share in 2021 and trailed just behind Google. The company also estimated the total transactions on its marketplace at 1.13 trillion won through 2021, exceeding the 1 trillion won per year mark for the first time. Moreover, One Store will benefit from the world’s efforts to break the app store monopoly and its own localization efforts. There are bills pending designed to curtail tech giants’ monopolistic behavior, such as the Open App Markets Act in the United States and the Digital Market Act in the European Union. These bills are expected to open up a new opportunity to the Korean marketplace, dedicated to mobile gaming apps, media content like webtoons and gaming gear, Lee said.Also, One Store charges customers lower commission fees for users compared with Google and Apple at home. The same policy will be applied to the overseas market, according to Lee. Moreover, One Store will support a wider range of payment options including vouchers, bank-to-bank transfers and prepaid cards. “We are seeing a strong pressure worldwide to open the doors to new app store operators, and we expect the entry barrier to disappear by late this year or early next year,” Lee said. Part of the cost for its overseas expansion will come from its initial public offering later this month, which could fetch up to 277.7 billion won. Immediately after the IPO, its market cap is expected to stand at up to 1.1 trillion won. This comes despite the unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and investors’ resulting flight to safety that have weighed down on the stock market. Its sister company SK Shieldus, a cybersecurity service company, withdrew from its bid to offer shares to the public on Friday. The company cited “jittery” market sentiment as its book building drew lackluster attention from institutional investors, reeling from macroeconomic concerns such as Russia‘s invasion of Ukraine and the US interest rate hike to fight inflation.Both SK Shieldus and One Store are controlled by SK Square, a carveout of Korea’s largest mobile carrier SK Telecom. SK Square’s share price hit an all-time low as it fell 5.3 percent on Monday. A One Store official said the company will go on to proceed with the IPO at all costs, considering the low IPO price at nearly the purchase price set in a $15 million equity investment by Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, a joint investment body by Microsoft and Deutsche Telekom.“We think it is the right timing to do the IPO. If we don’t we are losing the opportunity to grow our global presence,” One Store Chief Financial Officer Kim Sang-don said. One Store has never been in the black since it was founded in 2016. The company in 2021 recorded a 5.8 billion won operating loss, up over fivefold in a year. Kim anticipated a turnaround in 2022 with some 5 billion won operating profit.(consnow@heraldcorp.com)

US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference in Washington on May 4. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised the benchmark lending rate by a half percentage point in its ongoing effort to contain the highest inflation in four decades. (AFP)The US Federal Reserve’s biggest rate hike in 22 years poses a dilemma for South Korea’s central bank in adjusting the pace of its monetary tightening and for local businesses seeking to go public, experts said Friday.The Fed’s decision to raise its base rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday (Eastern Standard Time) that set its target federal funds rate to a range between 0.75 percent and 1 percent has presented new hurdles for the Bank of Korea, which is wary of the growing risks tied to capital outflow and a strong dollar trend. In the past, a higher base interest rate in the US has led to a weakening of the Korean won and capital outflow. Recently-appointed BOK Gov. Rhee Chang-yong expressed concerns last month that the higher US base rate could result in higher inflationary pressure here due to the won’s weakening. JP Morgan said in its Wednesday note that it noted a more hawkish-than-expected tone in the BOK’s April monetary policy meeting minutes, indicating the central bank is considering adopting a faster-than-expected monetary tightening timeline. “The minutes bolstered the risk case of a higher terminal rate than our previous expectation of 2.25 percent that we highlighted in our previous note,” the note said. The global banking group now forecast the BOK’s base rate to be raised to 2.5 percent by the end of the year. However, the BOK is also trying to hit the brakes on snowballing household debt, and a higher benchmark interest rate would lead to a heavier burden on debt repayment for households. “The BOK could take a ‘big step’ in May and July under the scenario of healthy exports and consumer spending, but it’s not that easy for them at the moment,” Joo Won, a senior economist at the Hyundai Research Institute said.“The household debt, which has increased to 1.862 quadrillion won ($1.46 trillion) as of end-2021, and risks that lead to an economic recession poses as major hurdles,” he added. The BOK’s benchmark interest rate currently stands at 1.5 percent after its policy board voted to a quarter percentage point rate hike last month. It marked the central bank’s fourth pandemic-era rate hike, after it ended more than a year of a record-low interest rate in August last year. The BOK’s next monetary policy board meeting is scheduled for May 26.Alongside the BOK, the Korean stock market was hit by the Fed’s latest move. SK shieldus, the cybersecurity arm of South Korean telecom giant SK Telecom, reportedly scrapped its plans for an initial public offering amid increased market volatilities due to the Fed’s “big step” rate hike. The firm received a lukewarm response from domestic and foreign institutional investors during a two-day demand forecasting session held Tuesday and Wednesday, dampening its original plan to raise up to 3.55 trillion won through its IPO initially scheduled for May 19. While volatilities are likely to continue, some analysts say that the local market has already absorbed the risks stemming from the Fed’s monetary tightening, painting a rosier-than-expected picture. “The market has preemptively absorbed the risks stemming from the US Fed’s hawkish moves, and the assessment of our stocks have fallen to the level during the 2008 financial crisis,” Samsung Securities analyst Jeong Myung-ji said.“Excluding stocks that are more vulnerable towards interest rates, the effects of the US Fed’s rate hikes on the Korean stock market are likely to be weak,” Jeong added.Korea’s benchmark Kospi closed 1.23 percent lower from the previous session at 2,644.51 on Friday, with foreigners offloading 357.9 billion won.By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

The corporate logo of SK Shieldus (SK Shieldus)SK Shieldus, the South Korean security service subsidiary of SK Group’s ICT arm SK Square, said on Friday that it has scrapped its plans for market debut, citing dampened investor sentiment.“We have submitted a delisting notice to the Financial Supervisory Service because the recent demand forecasting, which decides initial public offering prices, showed that our corporate value may not be well received,” the company said.Stressing that market sentiment has turned sour following global economic uncertainties, the company added it will restart the IPO process when market conditions improve.But Industry insiders say the sluggish demand for SK Shieldus’ IPO comes as the company’s corporate value is said to be overrated. The company was aiming to attract up to 3.55 trillion won ($2.79 billion) through the IPO, which was slated for May 19.In the course of calculating its IPO price, the company compared average stock prices of local security service providers like S-1 Corp., Taiwan Secom Co., AhnLab and Cyberone.However, AhnLab, the IT security firm founded by Ahn Cheol-soo -- the leader of the transition committee for President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol -- had seen an unusual spike in its stock price during March. Before logging a record high of 218,500 won, the stock price has averaged around only 70,000 won. If AhnLab had been eliminated from the calculation, the IPO price of SK Shieldus couldn’t have been that high, sources said.“Although SK Shieldus lags behind S-1, a bellwether security firm, in both sales revenue and profit, the company had sought to raise even higher market cap than the rival,” said Choi Nam-gon, researcher at Yuanta Securities, in a report.Choi added that of the 27.1 million shares the company aims to float, almost half of them will go to Blue Security Investment -- a special purpose company of Macquarie Finance Korea and the second largest shareholder -- since it is selling some of the existing shares to the public in order to cash them.Sources say SK Shieldus’ sudden withdrawal of IPO may have a negative impact on the market debut of SK Square’s other affiliate, One Store. The mobile app marketplace operator plans to go public later this year.Meanwhile, SK Shieldus became the first SK Group affiliate to have failed in making mega-sized deals like those made by SK Biopharmaceuticals, SK Bioscience, SK IE Technology Co. and SK REIT.SK Shieldus, formerly known as ADT Caps, changed its name in October last year, seeking to transform into a comprehensive life care platform. The company currently provides services on cybersecurity, convergence security, physical security, and safety and care in both real world and virtual communities. Last November, the company was spun off from Korea’s largest telecom carrier SK Telecom.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

SK Shieldus CEO Park Jin-hyo speaks at a virtual press conference in Seoul on Tuesday. (SK Shieldus)South Korean cybersecurity service provider SK shieldus Co. withdrew its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) Friday, citing lackluster investor confidence.SK shieldus, the cybersecurity arm of South Korean telecom giant SK Telecom Co., said it had submitted a delisting notice to the Financial Supervisory Service the same day, about a month after reporting an IPO plan in late March.The decision came as the company received lackluster response from domestic and foreign institutional investors during a two-day demand forecasting session Tuesday through Wednesday amid growing uncertainty over the global economy.""SK shieldus decided to shelve its listing, as demand forecasting for the final IPO price showed its corporate value may not be assessed in a proper way,"" the company said in a statement.After factoring in market conditions down the road, SK shieldus will again push for an IPO at an appropriate time when the company is capable of receiving proper assessment from investors, it added.SK shieldus had sought to raise up to 3.55 trillion won ($2.79 billion) through the IPO originally slated for May 19, in what could have been the biggest ever market debut by a local security service provider.SK shieldus, which changed its name from ADT Caps Co. last October, currently provides security services across four main categories -- cybersecurity, convergence security, physical security, and safety and care.Last year, the company chalked off 1.55 trillion won in sales, trailing its rival S-1 Corp. under South Korea's top conglomerate Samsung Group, whose top line came to 2.31 trillion won.SK shieldus is the fourth South Korean company that has backpedaled on IPO plans so far this year. In late January, Hyundai Engineering Co., the construction arm of Hyundai Motor Group, withdrew its plan to get its stocks listed on the country's main bourse due to adverse market conditions.In mid-March, Voronoi Inc., which manufactures kinase inhibitor and other new drugs, terminated its plan to list its shares on the country's tech-laden minor stock market amid sluggish investor interest, with renewable energy firm Daemyoung Energy Inc. recently following suit for the same reason.

"AT FIRST glance, Vodafone has nothing to complain about. On September 8th it sold for $6.6 billion the 3.2% stake in China Mobile that it had bought for $3.3 billion between 2000 and 2002. Such a handsome profit ought to be a cue to crack open the champagne and roast some Beijing duck. Yet the British mobile-phone giant did not get what it really wanted: a way into China. In other countries, Vodafone has had a knack of turning a small investment into a controlling stake, but not in the Middle Kingdom. And it is not alone.

Since the late 1990s, several large state-owned Chinese companies have listed their shares. These initial public offerings typically included “cornerstone” investments by big Western firms. For example, BP, Exxon and Shell (three oil firms) and ABB (a Swiss-Swedish conglomerate) took strategic stakes in PetroChina and Sinopec (two big Chinese oil companies). Alcoa, an American aluminium company, invested in Chalco, a Chinese one. And Western banks bought chunks of the leading Chinese state banks when they were listed.

Foreign firms brought several things to the table: capital, technology, management skills and the prospect of better corporate governance. The Chinese press often referred to them as “elder brothers”. In return, these Western firms wanted access to China's huge domestic market.

It did not work out that way. The Chinese state-owned firms did not need capital so badly that they were prepared to cede control to foreigners. Some also found that the Westerners had less to teach them than they had hoped. “Fly-in” expat managers were often unfamiliar with China, says David Michael, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group. Chinese firms tended to learn more from multinationals that had taken the trouble to build their own large sales forces in China, he says.

Chinese firms no longer feel like little brothers. China Mobile now has a market value half as large again as Vodafone's. PetroChina is much bigger than BP. Both Chinese firms are now rich enough to buy whatever expertise they want.

Western energy companies were quick to notice this shift. BP, Shell, ABB and Exxon all sold their holdings in state-owned Chinese firms by 2005. Alcoa got out in 2007. Financial firms followed, in whole or part, during the financial crisis. When China's state-owned Agricultural Bank was recently listed, no big Western bank bought a significant stake.

Western firms grumble about their failure to turn their stakes in China Inc into a foothold in the Chinese market, but not too loudly, so that they do not annoy the government. Besides, thanks to a rising stockmarket, most made sacks of money from their investments.

"  By Lee Kyung-min IT giant Kakao is coming under intense criticism over its plan to sell off over 10 percent of its stake in its mobility affiliate to a private equity fund (PEF), according to industry and firm officials, Monday. Kakao owns a majority stake in Kakao Mobility, the operator of the ride-hailing service app Kakao T, which has an estimated total value of about 8.5 trillion won ($6.5 billion).Kakao characterizes the move as a business strategy to reorganize its corporate portfolio and financials, a much-needed breakthrough to navigate a bout of risks involving a sharp fall in the share prices of the firm and its key affiliates, amid allegations of business overreach at the expense of smaller market players.However, employees of the mobility affiliate call it an irresponsible tactic to altogether dodge accountability for the recent failures in corporate performances and rapidly souring public sentiment. Whether the escalating conflict will dial down remains to be seen, as it will be managed by the Corporate Alignment Center (CAC), a body of Kakao overseeing its subsidiaries. The CAC will hold a meeting with mobility employees soon, according to an industry watcher close to the matter, in an attempt to address concerns about the firm essentially making a hefty short-term profit at the expense of workers left vulnerable to pay cuts and layoffs.

" By Lee Min-hyung  Kyobo Life Insurance has pledged to try again for a long-awaited initial public offering (IPO), after the move was blocked last Friday when the Korea Exchange didn't grant its approval during a preliminary examination.   The exchange operator did not share additional reasons behind the decision, but the ongoing legal dispute between Kyobo and its financial investor ― led by Affinity Equity Partners ― is considered to be the core reason behind the exchange operator's lack of approval.  ""Kyobo makes it clear that we will push ahead with the IPO again after ending the dispute with our shareholders as soon as possible,"" a spokesman at Kyobo said.  Kyobo Chairman Shin Chang-jae Friday attended a meeting of the exchange's listing committee to underscore the need for its timely IPO.  ""About two-thirds of our shareholders are in favor of our listing, and Kyobo is in dire need of the IPO for the firm's sustainable growth and development,"" he told reporters after the meeting.  The Affinity consortium is the Korean insurer's second-largest shareholder, acquiring a 24 percent stake in 2012 for 1.2 trillion won ($921.7 billion). The consortium demanded that the Kyobo chief buy back its shares at 409,000 won apiece by exercising its put option, but the insurer declined to do so, citing excessive pricing.  A put option is a derivative instrument that gives the holder the right to sell an asset, at a specified price, by a specified date to the writer of the put.  Under the put option agreement, Affinity was given the right to withdraw its investment unless Kyobo went public by 2015. After Kyobo delayed its IPO timeline, Affinity ended up exercising the right. Both sides have yet to reach any clear consensus over the valuation of the insurer's pre-IPO stock price.   The case was then brought to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) for arbitration. The authority said that Shin did not have the duty to buy back the shares at the price offered by Affinity, nor did he have to offer any interest payments or compensation to the investor, during the first round of arbitration last September.  The Affinity consortium appealed to the ICC and called for a second arbitration.  Kyobo urged Affinity to stop taking legal measures that block its planned IPO.  ""Affinity should drop any idea of disturbing our IPO plan by engaging in a useless legal battle, and cooperate with Kyobo as its second-largest shareholder,"" the Kyobo spokesperson said.  The Affinity consortium, however, stepped up its criticism of Kyobo, urging Shin to fulfill his responsibility first before carrying on with the IPO.

The two digital banks seem to have realized that a similar IPO strategy to KakaoBank's would not guarantee success for them.   As K bank has officially kicked off its IPO schedule, with submission of a preliminary evaluation request to the Korea Exchange (KRX) at the end of last month ― the first step for the bank's listing on the KOSPI ― the bank plans to emphasize its comfortable service-oriented banking. It is a different approach from KakaoBank's focus on its IT-based digital platform in its IPO strategy. Rather than stressing the bank's digital platform as a key growth factor, K bank has been highlighting the core competency of its banking services. The bank's partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Upbit is also expected to be emphasized, as a way to differentiate it from KakaoBank in terms of growth potential. However, it is uncertain whether the bank's plan to distance itself from KakaoBank's case would succeed in the market's evaluation of K bank's future growth. Given that it usually takes around four months from requesting a preliminary evaluation to going public, K bank is expected to be listed as early as November. K bank was Korea's very first internet-only bank, founded days earlier than KakaoBank in January 2016.

It is a different approach from KakaoBank's focus on its IT-based digital platform in its IPO strategy. Rather than stressing the bank's digital platform as a key growth factor, K bank has been highlighting the core competency of its banking services.   The bank's partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Upbit is also expected to be emphasized, as a way to differentiate it from KakaoBank in terms of growth potential. However, it is uncertain whether the bank's plan to distance itself from KakaoBank's case would succeed in the market's evaluation of K bank's future growth.   Given that it usually takes around four months from requesting a preliminary evaluation to going public, K bank is expected to be listed as early as November. K bank was Korea's very first internet-only bank, founded days earlier than KakaoBank in January 2016.   Meanwhile, Toss Bank ― the third digital bank in Korea ― is putting its priority on raising its corporate value to a maximum level, rather than accelerating its IPO plan. As Toss is a comprehensive financial platform that not only involves banking services but also brokerage as well as other functions, the company seems to be focusing on attracting further investments for now, at a corporate valuation of about 10 trillion won.It is largely expected that Toss' IPO will come as early as the second half of next year or even later than that. In the meantime, Toss is planning to brand itself as a total financial platform as well as a global fintech firm, differentiating itself from KakaoBank.

"Korea's top fashion unicorn dismisses concerns of bubble in sectorBy Kim Yoo-chulThe COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a huge blow to the fashion industry, causing a lot of traditional merchants to be unsure of how to maintain their bottom lines as consumers shift in droves to e-commerce platforms.Fashion retailers that managed to actively implement e-commerce strategies have benefited significantly from the pandemic. Plus, new and existing fashion e-commerce brands have been hugely successful, while the pandemic ended up gradually widening the gap between digitally-driven apps and platforms and offline laggards.Fashion industry experts have no doubt that the business of fashion is on track to seeing a new order take root, because the pandemic has changed how consumers interact with brands and redesign their shopping experience.From an investor's standpoint, the pandemic has led to the rise of ""unicorn"" fashion e-commerce companies and an increase in their valuations. Startup companies with a billion-dollar valuation are labelled as unicorns as they were once considered as rare creatures.Some industry analysts warned investors to be wary of a bubble forming in the industry that could burst at any time.But a senior executive at the country's top fashion e-commerce platform operator dismissed such concerns.""Because a new order is prevailing in the industry given increased investor focus on sustainability-oriented considerations during and after the pandemic, with particular demand for growth potential, a few rational players will thrive even more,"" Seo Eun-hee, the marketing chief of Musinsa, said in a recent interview with The Korea Times at the fashion e-commerce unicorn's new studio in Seongsu-dong, also known as Seoul's Brooklyn.   By Kim Yoo-chul  The COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a huge blow to the fashion industry, causing a lot of traditional merchants to be unsure of how to maintain their bottom lines as consumers shift in droves to e-commerce platforms.  Fashion retailers that managed to actively implement e-commerce strategies have benefited significantly from the pandemic. Plus, new and existing fashion e-commerce brands have been hugely successful, while the pandemic ended up gradually widening the gap between digitally-driven apps and platforms and offline laggards.  Fashion industry experts have no doubt that the business of fashion is on track to seeing a new order take root, because the pandemic has changed how consumers interact with brands and redesign their shopping experience.  From an investor's standpoint, the pandemic has led to the rise of ""unicorn"" fashion e-commerce companies and an increase in their valuations. Startup companies with a billion-dollar valuation are labelled as unicorns as they were once considered as rare creatures.  Some industry analysts warned investors to be wary of a bubble forming in the industry that could burst at any time.  But a senior executive at the country's top fashion e-commerce platform operator dismissed such concerns.  ""Because a new order is prevailing in the industry given increased investor focus on sustainability-oriented considerations during and after the pandemic, with particular demand for growth potential, a few rational players will thrive even more,"" Seo Eun-hee, the marketing chief of Musinsa, said in a recent interview with The Korea Times at the fashion e-commerce unicorn's new studio in Seongsu-dong, also known as Seoul's Brooklyn.  ""I would say the fashion e-commerce industry is experiencing the 'valley of death.'

More than 80 percent of new ventures that fail to win investors' support end up failing within the first three years. That's because large investors prefer to park their money in business models that are proven and ready to scale, rather than R&D and development efforts.Founded in 2012, Musinsa operates an online shopping mall called ""Musinsa store,"" a fashion magazine ""Musinsa magazine,"" and offline store ""Musinsa store."" As of May this year, Musinsa's is valued at around 5 trillion won, up from 2.5 trillion won just a few years ago, according to officials in the local investment banking industry.The country's top fashion e-commerce platform reached 2.3 trillion won worth of monetary transactions by last year, up 90 percent year-on-year. Revenue in 2021 reached 466.7 billion won, up 41 percent year-on-year, while the company reported 54.2 billion won in operating profit, up 19 percent, it said in a statement to The Korea Times. It has over 10 million users and so far, the company has attracted 320 billion won in investments, including 130 billion won from IMM private equity. Its outstanding growth trajectory stems from its offering of a wider selection of foreign casual brands that were quite tough to find in Korea along with limited-edition items. No change in prime targets, phased global expansion strategy Regarding its brand positioning statement, which could lead to market differentiation from competitors, the marketing chief Seo said Musinsa is attempting to rise as a multi-platform that could include fashion- and culture-centric features.

But she said Musinsa is specifically eyeing Japan, countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia for increased market penetration.

Musinsa earlier scrapped its plan to acquire controlling stakes in its domestic rival, which focuses on Japanese shoppers because the two failed to agree on key conditions regarding the deal.

"Blowup of Terra's stablecoin raises credibility concerns for industry, forcing crypto investors to wait longer for price rebound By Kim Yoo-chulThings are changing rapidly in the world of crypto. Very recently, the global cryptocurrency market saw an extension of volatility even to stablecoins, mostly due to the huge collapse of the TerraUSD, a UST or algorithmic stablecoin, and its sister token, Luna ― which should theoretically maintain a 1:1 peg to a currency and commodity. Plus, because inflation remains too much of a force on central banks around the world, pressuring them to move expeditiously to bring the level back down by raising the benchmark rate sharply, more than 40 percent of crypto holders are now underwater in terms of their investments, according to analysts.All of the numbers are just bad. The price of bitcoin, the benchmark cryptocurrency in the industry, has fallen below $21,000, data shown by market tracker investing.com said. This fall is a major break from the $31,000-to-$32,000 price range bitcoin had gotten into since the collapse of Terra's UST back in early May. This year, Bitcoin's prices have been slashed by over 50 percent of its all-time high of around $69,000 back in November 2021. The crypto market's total market capitalization has crashed to under $1 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.Cryptocurrency analysts have no big fears that the growing inflation or elevated uncertainty regarding the economic climate could persist in the market as core dragging factors. Additionally, the belief that crypto assets offer a hedge against inflation is weakening as recent years' price increases have been thanks to excess market liquidity, which also led to the rise of the major tech stocks listed on the Nasdaq. The point is that both technology stocks and cryptocurrencies are exposed to the U.S. Federal Reserve's and other central banks' monetary tightening concerns. Investors are required to have more patience if they want to give their investments the best chance for profit-taking. Lee Sirgoo, one of the influential figures in the global crypto industry, as he is the chief executive at Dunamu, the operator of the country's largest cryptocurrency operator, Upbit, didn't deny that the crypto market is heading towards being more bearish than bullish. Institutional investors, who have kept their crypto assets in ""cold wallets,"" a type of digital wallet that stores cryptocurrency offline, have started unloading their holdings due to the worsening macro-economic conditions.""Normally, big institutional investors don't store their cryptocurrency assets in exchanges, the amount of which is huge but out of circulation, as they use cold wallets. Amid higher crypto demand, this practice led to the increase in cryptocurrency prices. But they want to prepare for the risks associated to the additional fall in cryptocurrencies by reducing their crypto holdings, resulting in more supply and price fall,"" Lee said in a recent interview at its headquarters in Seoul.The CEO viewed that the cryptocurrency industry is facing ""credibility problems"" because risk contagion in the market is closely connected to such external shocks, which could lead to a ""butterfly effect."" But Lee omitted saying that the continued market tumble could also lead the industry itself to face a structural downturn.""When it comes to blockchain technology, making reward systems visible really matters.

The financial authorities are considering mandating ICO hopefuls to submit investor prospectuses, security declarations, detailed information on transaction risks, associated taxes and fees with the money raised from the ICO should be deposited to a bank for the release of detailed accounting reports.The chief executive said despite such challenging factors, which led to what some crypto investors are dubbing as a ""crypto winter,"" the market's high volatility won't be permanent.

"Aston Martin, the British luxury car company, said today, Friday, that the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which is the sovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom, will become the second largest shareholder in the company, with a stake of approximately 17 percent, through a capital increase operation aimed at repaying debts and strengthening the company's position. The company faces rising debt, a falling stock price and a struggling Formula One team. It said it plans to raise 653 million pounds ($773.15 million) through an investment from the Public Investment Fund of 78 million pounds and a separate rights issue of 575 million pounds. The Saudi Fund will own a 16.7 percent stake in the company, thus being in second place among shareholders after an 18.3 percent stake that will be owned by the U-Tree entity of the company's president, Lawrence Stroll, after the rights issue, and it will have the right to two seats on the Aston Martin board of directors. As for the shareholder, which was in second place before the move, which is the German Mercedes-Benz company, its share will reach 9.7 percent after the capital increase. The company aims to increase its stake to 20 percent by next year.
 Aston Martin has struggled since its initial public offering, which took place in late 2018. Its London-listed shares are down about 73 percent so far this year. The share price jumped 10% on Friday morning, after hitting a record low earlier. Aston Martin said half of the new capital the company will raise from the move will go to paying down debt. The company's debt at the end of March amounted to 957 million pounds. The capital increase will also accelerate the pace of future capital expenditure. And the Financial Times reported yesterday, Thursday, that Aston Martin is close to completing a deal to raise more than 500 million pounds by bringing in the Saudi sovereign wealth fund as a major shareholder. The Public Investment Fund owns stakes in electric car maker Lucid and British car group McLaren. The fund did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment.

"Oil prices rose yesterday morning, for the fifth day in a row, and Brent reached its highest level since October 2018, and is heading towards $ 80 a barrel, amid concerns about supply, at a time when demand is increasing in some regions of the world with the easing of measures to combat the “Corona” pandemic. Brent crude rose $1.15, or 1.5 percent, to $79.24 a barrel, after it recorded its third consecutive weekly increase last week. US crude rose $1.07, or 1.5 percent, to $75.05 a barrel, which is close to its highest price since July, after recording its fifth consecutive weekly increase last week. Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for the price of Brent crude by the end of the year by ten dollars to $ 90 a barrel due to the recovery in fuel demand at a faster than expected rate from the repercussions of the spread of the delta mutated from the Corona virus and the impact of Hurricane “Ida” on American production, which led to a decrease in global supplies. Goldman Sachs said: “We have long had a positive outlook for oil prices, but the deficit between supply and demand is currently larger than our expectations, with global demand recovering from the impact of the delta shift faster than our previous unanimous expectations and with global supplies remaining at levels lower than our previous expectations.” The recovery in demand surprised the member countries of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, the group known as “OPEC +”, and they faced difficulties in raising production with the continued lack of investments and the postponement of maintenance work due to the pandemic.
