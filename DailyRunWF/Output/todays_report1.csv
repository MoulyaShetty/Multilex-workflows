Tanzania: JATU eyes 7.5bn/- capital through IPO,https://www.african-markets.com/en/stock-markets/dse/tanzania-jatu-eyes-7-5bn-capital-through-ipo," June 08, 2021 12:36 PM",2022-07-21 12:25:46.435669,"AN agri-based firm, Jatu Plc, is seeking to raise a capital of 7.5bn/- through an Initial Public Offer (IPO) on which it listed 15,000,000 new shares.
 
During an event to launch the shares over the weekend, JATU’s Managing Director Peter Isare said the capital will be injected into commercial farming and setting up processing factories to add value to agricultural produce.
 
“Our aim is to ensure that Tanzanians benefit from a whole value chain of the agriculture,” Mr Isare stated in Dar es Salaam.
 
The company will focus on crops that have high demand within the country, including maize, sunflower and rice as well as investing in modern farm equipment such as tractors.





“Support us in this new endeavour so that we can prove that we really want to transform agriculture in the country,” Mr Isare assured.
 
He said the agricultural projects that the form intends to venture into would also contribute to the country’s food security.
 
The launching of the shares under the IPO came after the Stock Exchange (DSE) temporarily suspended Jatu from trading for two months to pave the way for issuing an (IPO).
 
The bourse said the suspension started June 1st and would last up to July 28th as the firm wants to list 15,000,000 new shares in a way of splitting whereby an IPO price is 500/- a share,
 
Normally when the firm splits its shares, the number of shares of that company increase, but the ‘market capitalisation’ remains the same and as the number of shares increases, the price per share goes down.
 
Orbit Securities Head of Research and Analytics, Imani Muhingo, said the suspension was ‘a well procedural’ since Jatu is an IPO from the beginning of this month.
 
“It’s self-defeating if the shares would still be trading in the secondary market” while others are in the primary market, Mr Muhingo told Daily News yesterday.
 
Jatu, the agri-based firm share was trading 1,200/- before the suspension on Tuesday against 420/- during listing late last November.
 
Vertex International Securities Ahmed Nganya seconded Mr Muhingo said the “temporary suspension was to allow for the IPO of new Jatu shares that take place” between 1st June and 15 July.
DSE said in a statement that the suspension following the guidance from Capital Markets and Securities Authority (CMSA) necessitate the harmonization of Jatu’s corporation actions.
The statement said all shares, following the share split for existing shares together with new shares subscribed during the IPO, will be credited electronically and deposited in the Central Depository System on July 29th to enable secondary trading.
Jatu runs and manages various agricultural projects in collaboration with its members, which currently totalling at over 30,000 members.
Agriculture is the main foundation and pillar of the company, where Jatu seeks areas or farms and researches."

The IPO comes after a six-year drought since Umeme (UMEM) listed on the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) in 2012.
It will bring the number of locally listed companies on USE to nine. Currently, USE has eight locally listed stocks and eight cross-listed companies – all from Kenya.
The company, according to the prospectus that has been sent to the Capital Markets Authority for approval, hopes to put on offer more than 657 million shares, through which the public will own a share of Uganda’s largest pharmaceutical firm.
Renaissance Capital will be the lead transaction advisor while Crested Capital will be the lead sponsor for the IPO that is expected to mobilise at least Shs100b, according to sources familiar with the process.

Cipla Quality Chemicals, according to the prospectus, is currently conducting a book building process that will inform its final figures and decision.
The company is currently owned by a consortium of investors. At 62.3 per cent, Meditab Holdings holds the largest stake.
The Indian drug maker and biotechnology company, which sells under the Cipla trading name hopes to hold 51 per cent after the IPO.
Other shareholders include Capitalworks Investment Partners (14.4 per cent), TLG Capital, which intends to sell part of its 12.50 per cent stake and Mr Emmanuel Katongole, who holds 3.6 per cent.
Mr Katongole, the Cipla Quality Chemicals chairman and a founding director, hopes to reduce his shareholding to 1.80 per cent after the IPO.
Mr Frederick Mutebi Kitaka and Mr George Baguma are also expected to reduce their respective shareholding from the 3.6 per cent they currently hold. Mr Katongole yesterday told Daily Monitor they will begin discussing particulars of the intended IPO on Monday, declaiming to divulge into details.
In 2004, Quality Chemicals partnered with Cipla and the government of Uganda to form a joint venture that would later establish one of the largest pharmaceutical industries in East Africa.
The government of Uganda in 2010 divested from the drug manufacturer, selling its stake to Cipla Quality Chemicals at a transaction that was valued at about $5m (Shs18.7b).
Mr Keith Kalyegira, the Capital Market Authority chief executive officer, yesterday said the IPO indicates growing confidence in Uganda’s equity markets, which has afforded the public to own a share of some of Uganda prime companies.
“The more people believe the more we shall see investor participate. It is a very strong confidence move that [Cipla Quality Chemicals] has taken,” he said.
Companies, he said, are increasingly finding relevant to mobilise cheap resources through the stock exchange instead of resorting to banks, whose interest rates are increasingly becoming volatile.

The prospectus reveals that the firm plans to sell an 18% stake in the company, which will be increased to 20% within 24 months after the initial public offering. The company’s board and shareholders agreed to tender 657,179,319 of the company’s 3,651,909,200 shares. With the firm’s authorised share capital currently at Shs45,648,865,000, it means that the issued shares are valued at Shs3,651,909,200 or Shs12.5 per share.
 
Emmanuel Katongole, the company’s executive chairman, said the offer “is a sale of shares by the selling shareholders” and is not aimed at raising capital. “The Company is well capitalised, is cash generative and has sufficient resources to self-fund its growth and, as such, does not anticipate the need to raise any primary capital at this time,” Mr Katongole said in a statement published in the prospectus.

The offer shares will comprise shares offered by Cipla EU, a United Kingdom subsidiary of Cipla Ltd, Capitalworks, a South African private equity firm, the three Ugandan founders, and Amistad, a Mauritius-registered company controlled by TLG Capital. Cipla EU is to sell all its shares, currently 11.25% of the company’s issued shares, while Capitalworks will see its stake reduce to 11.11% from the current 14.4%.

Only Mediatab, a Mauritius-registered company wholly owned by Cipla Ltd, will retain the same stake, 51.05%, it currently owns after the initial public offering.
 
A preliminary prospectus is filed by a firm with the securities industry regulator before its initial public offering and is “intended to provide pertinent information to prospective shareholders about the company’s business, managers, strategic initiatives, financial statements, and ownership structure.”
 
The document is issued before the offering price is determined by the underwriter. The price will be determined after the book building process – in which the underwriter tries to determine the IPO price based on the demand of the shares from institutional investors – and will be included in the final prospectus, which is expected to be published on 10 August.
 
According to the preliminary prospectus, the book building for Cipla Quality Chemicals opened on 26 July and will close on 9 August. The IPO will open to retail investors on 13 August, allowing them to take part in the offer, and will close on 24 August. The company expects to be admitted to listing and trading on the USE on 24 September.
 
The Kenyan subsidiary of Renaissance Capital, the investment bank, is the lead advisor on the transaction as well as the sole underwriter, while Bowmans (AF Mpanga Advocates) was retained as legal counsel.
 
Other advisors are Ernst & Young Limited as reporting accountants, Standard Chartered Bank as the receiving bank, and C&R Group as registrar of the company. Crested Capital is the transaction’s lead sponsoring broker.
 
However, as is spelt out in the prospectus, those dates could be amended and extended if Cipla Quality Chemicals, the Uganda Securities Exchange, and the Capital Markets Authority agree."

In a statement issued last Friday, the bank said over 12 500 applications were received from local and one international investor(s), to the value N$1,4 billion.
 
The initial public offer was for 81 million shares, however, investors demanded 160 million shares, leading to an oversubscription of almost twice the public offer.
 
The 81 million shares offer raised N$722,2 million.





Retail applicants, including individuals, rendered 12 478 applications and they will all be considered, the bank said.
 
Institutional investors including pension funds and investment companies made 45 applications to the value of N$1,1 billion, an indication that the market is indeed flooded with money looking for investments.
 
Only one international investor was attracted to the Standard Bank offer, making an application worth N$70 million.
 
While all the retail applicants would be allocated a stake in the bank, only 41,58% of N$1 billion worth of applications rendered by institutional investors will be accepted and 20% of the N$70 million from the international investor will be considered.
 
The rejection of part of the Namibian institutional investors and the international investor will result in at least N$700 million that should look for investments elsewhere.
 
Vetumbuavi Mungunda, the bank's chief executive officer, had said although it was an odd time to list, the bank is going to operate for the long term and for that reason he said what the economy was going through now is just a cycle.
 
From the turnout, it appears investors were convinced by his talk amid the bank's high dependency on the property market, an alarmingly high non-performing loan ration, minimal digitisation and them not being engaged in the micro-lending market. This seemed not to ward off investors.
 
One would say the interest rested in the bank's loan book growth in these difficult times, a better earnings per share and solid parent company, Standard Bank SA.
 
The Namibian has reported that the market is flooded with too much money looking for investments, and the over-subscription of Standard Bank's shares confirms this.
 
According to PSG Wealth Namibia's analysis of the public offer results, the offer was oversubscribed 1,98 times.
 
Following the conclusion of the allocation from the public offer, Standard Bank is expected to list on the main board of the Namibian Stock Exchange (NSX) with a free float of 25,1%.
 
The NSX has approved the listing of all the issued ordinary shares of SBN Holdings (SNO), from 09h00 on Friday, 15 November 2019.
 
According to the public offering prospectus, the main purpose of the public offer was to allow selected applicants and members of the public to participate directly in the equity growth and income streams of SBN Holdings.
 
The public offer was also to allow Standard Bank to broaden Namibian ownership in the group, broaden Namibian previously disadvantaged individual's ownership in the group and to provide the liquidity mechanism to unlock value for the Purros Scheme (an employee share trust).
 
There are, however, talks that shareholders in the Purros Scheme might sell their shares after 31 December 2019."

MTN commenced moves to list on the Ghana Stock Exchange, GSE, in 2016, as part of conditions under which it secured the 4G license in late 2015.
 
It was expected to finalize processes to float shares on the GSE by 2017.
 
In an exclusive interview with JoyBusiness, Managing Director of the Ghana Stock Exchange, Kofi Yamoah indicated that the company has submitted all the necessary documents and awaiting approval from the regulatory bodies before going public.

He said, “They’ve submitted the necessary documents to the GSE for review. We believe that at the end of the first quarter, we’ll see the public offer for that entity taking off.”
 
Mr Yamoah described the move as one of the significant activities to occur before the end of the first quarter of 2018.
 
Last year, the CEO of MTN Ghana, Ebenezer Asante, explained that the move to sell part of the company’s shares to Ghanaians is part of the localization that came with the 4G license.
 
“It’s very clear from the license that 35% of MTN should be moved into Ghanaian hands and since we required the license we have engaged the regulators both in the NCA as well as the Central Bank and also with the Securities and Exchange Commission,” he said.
 
This is said to impact positively on trading in the Ghanaian market.

Nigeria’s IROKO to file for IPO on London Stock Exchange,https://www.african-markets.com/en/news/west-africa/nigeria/nigeria-s-iroko-to-file-for-ipo-on-london-stock-exchange," February 10, 2021 6:06 PM",2022-07-21 12:26:21.224270,"Nigerian-based media company, IROKO plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market in 2022.
 
Founded in 2011 by Jason Njoku and Bastian Gotter, Iroko is one of Africa’s first mainstream online movie streaming websites, and it has the world’s largest online catalog of Nollywood films.
 
According to TheAfricaReport, the media company will raise between $20 million and $30 million valuing the company at $80 million to $100 million. Discussions with brokers will start in the coming weeks. Njoku holds a stake of 18% in the debt-free company.





In 2020, Irokotv planned to increase its average revenue per user in Africa from $7-8 to $20-25. It seemed the company was set to achieve that until the pandemic came. Consumer spending in Nigeria and other African markets reduced and subscriptions dropped by 70% but international subscribers grew by 200% during the lockdown hitting a $25-30 ARPU range.
 
Jason Njoku told TechCrunch that, “The costs of pursuing Africa growth is what was really resized dramatically. We were so focused on defending Africa and basically ended up doing nothing. Zero marketing or anything to drive that.
 
“We pulled back to focus on where our economics actually makes sense. Our international business organically grew double-digit in 2020 and we expect it to continue this way for the foreseeable future.”
 
Why London Stock Exchange?

IROKO makes 80% of its revenue outside Africa and listing on a foreign exchange will help consolidate its efforts. According to Njoku, the Nigerian Stock Exchange or other local exchanges do not have a history of listing early-stage tech companies; therefore, the London Stock Exchange makes more sense in the short term.
The company is focusing more on international subscribers primarily in the U.S and the U.K where it has been able to execute a 150% price increase from $25 per year to $60 per year without any negative impact.
The company is seeking a market cap of about $100 million, which is small for the primary market. This is why it is choosing to list on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the LSE. A sub-market of the LSE, the AIM is built specifically for small-cap companies.

 
IROKO secured around $30 million in total during its Series E funding in January 2016 and it plans to raise less or a similar amount when going public in 2022.
 
The only company to have gone public from Nigeria is Jumia. Interswitch, a payment processing company valued at $1 billion is also planning to go public in the next 2 years."
Kenya: No offers in two years as NSE suffers IPOs drought,https://www.african-markets.com/en/stock-markets/nse/kenya-no-offers-in-two-years-as-nse-suffers-ipos-drought," March 07, 2018 10:48 PM",2022-07-21 12:26:22.437012,"Kenya capital markets lagged behind peers in Africa in Initial Public Offers (IPOs) and other secondary listings in the last five years, a new report shows.
 
According to the 2017 Africa Capital Markets Watch by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) had no IPOs raised in either 2016 or 2017.
 
In the last five years, the NSE has only been able to raise Sh4.2 billion ($42 million) through two IPOs offered in 2014 and 2015 raising Sh700 million and Sh3.5 billion respectively.
 
“There were also no IPO activity in 2017 in Ghana compared to 2016, which saw $102 million raised on the Ghana Stock Exchange.

This year, the Nairobi Securities Exchange and Nigeria Stock Exchange both extended their IPO drought, with no new IPO capital raised in either 2016 or 2017,” the report said.
 
In contrast, elsewhere on the continent, 2017 saw some significant increases in IPO value on exchanges in Namibia, Rwanda and Tanzania compared to 2016.
 
This increased activity can be attributed to a combination of continued efforts by governments to either privatise stakes in state-owned entities or encourage local companies to list on domestic exchanges to build local market participation, and in certain situations, regulatory requirements compelling certain companies in certain sectors to list.
 
Over a five-year period, the vast majority of Further Offer (FO) activity (which include rights issues and second public offering) took place in South Africa, representing 65 per cent and 86 per cent of total FO volume and value, respectively.
 
Kenyan FO activity stalled in 2017 with no further offers on the NSE, potentially attributable to the tense environment that developed subsequent to elections held during the year.
 
During the period, Kenya was only able to raise a total of Sh31.8 billion from five offers, with two raising Sh4.6 billion in 2014, and three raising Sh27.2 billion in 2016.

Egyptian Exchange awaits 6 new IPOs in 2022,https://www.african-markets.com/en/stock-markets/egx/egyptian-exchange-awaits-6-new-ipos-in-2022," February 10, 2022 11:27 AM",2022-07-21 12:26:31.494246,"An opinion poll conducted by Daily News Egypt on the expected initial public offerings (IPOs) during 2022, revealed that three government IPOs and another three private ones are expected this year. 
 
The first quarter (1Q) of this year will witness two offerings, one from the public sector and the other from the private sector. The first of which is Macro Group for Pharmaceuticals, which is expected to be offered in February, the second is the IPO of the state-owned football company, Ghazl El-Mahalla SC.
 
Mohamed Omran, the Chairperson of the Financial Regulatory Authority, expected the shares of Macro Group for Pharmaceuticals to debut on the stock exchange (EGX) this month.
 
He added that the list of propositions includes the offering of Ghazl El-Mahalla SC Company, which will be its first time under the public subscription system. “There is also another company which is currently communicating with the authority to complete its offering on the EGX under the public subscription system during the coming period,” he revealed.
 





 
Omran expects that 2022 will witness a large number of IPOs.
 
“Companies affiliated with the Egyptian Armed Forces are expected to be offered this year, in addition to the government IPO programme and the private sector’s offerings.
 
Mohamed Maher, the CEO of Prime Holding — which is responsible for the offering — said that the procedures for offering Ghazl El-Mahalla SC on the EGX are expected to be completed by the end of February or March at the latest. He added that the IPO will be incorporated as a new company with an initial capital of EGP 200m. 
 
The remaining unissued capital in the offered shares will come in the form of an in-kind contribution from the Misr Spinning and Weaving Company.
 
Moreover, sources closely related to the offering of the Ebtikar for financial services said that the company’s IPO is expected after the Eid Al-Fitr holiday (in May), as an agreement is currently underway with an independent financial adviser to prepare fair value studies. 
 
Also, the company is awaiting the approval of the relevant authorities regarding the implementation of the Vodafone deal, which completed its due diligence checks.
 
Among the private sector companies expected to be listed on the Egyptian Exchange during the second half (2H) of 2022 is Abu Auf.
 
Also, sources told Daily News Egypt that the government IPO programme will witness the offering of three other state-owned companies’ shares in the EGX before the end of the current fiscal year. The government IPO programme resumed with the e-finance IPO in 2021, following a long hiatus after selling a secondary stake in the Eastern Company in March 2019. 
 




 
Besides Ghazl El-Mahalla SC, Banque du Caire is the most prominent of these IPOs, and it is expected to be completed during 2H of 2022.
 
It is worth noting that Qalaa Holding has announced the postponement of the listing of TAQA Arabia on the EGX again to 2023 when market conditions are expected to improve.
 
TAQA Arabia was supposed to debut in 2020, however, the company postponed the offering to 2021 and then decided last week to postpone it again till next year.
 
Followers of the Egyptian financial markets have always wondered when can Egypt catch up with global financial markets in terms of the number and sizes of IPOs.
 
Recently, Arab stock exchanges have witnessed more IPOs compared to EGX; after a disappointing year for Egyptian IPOs, dealers are waiting for a new year with better investment opportunities.
 
The EGX only witnessed 3 offerings in 2021 with a value of EGP 7.95bn, including two companies in the main market and another in the small projects market, with little growth compared to 2020, which witnessed 1 offering of EGP 200m.
 
Last year, the EGX witnessed the offering of e-finance, which debuted with 1.6bn shares with a value of EGP 5.84bn, along with Taaleem Management Services with 730.3m shares with a value of EGP 2.1bn. While the IPO of Emerald for Development and Project Management in the SMEs market with 425m shares worth EGP 57.6m. 
 
Emerald Real Estate Investment Company was also offered on the Nile Stock Exchange with a value of EGP 200m.
 
Looking over the past year, global IPOs witnessed their best performance in 20 years, with 2,388 deals worth $453.3bn, according to data released by Ernst & Young, increasing deals by 64% year-on-year (y-o-y). Issuance revenue also jumped by 67% y-o-y.
 
The US continued to dominate the global IPO markets, as it acquired about 80% of all deals in the Americas region, which contributed to an increase in the number of regional deals by 87% y-o-y to 528 deals, while the value of issuances amounted to $174.6bn."

Tanzania: Halotel Makes Progress in Floating IPO At Dar Bourse,https://www.african-markets.com/en/stock-markets/dse/tanzania-halotel-makes-progress-in-floating-ipo-at-dar-bourse," January 25, 2018 10:13 PM",2022-07-21 12:26:37.170180,"Halotel Tanzania has submitted its prospectus to the Capital Markets and Security Authority (CMSA) to be considered for floating an initial public offering (IPO) at Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE).
 
CSMA principal public relations officer Charles Shirima confirmed that Halotel the company submitted its prospectus late last year.
 
Halotel is among telecommunications companies that are yet to float 25 per cent of their shares through an initial public offering at DSE in accordance with the Electronic and Postal Communication Act (2010).
 
“We returned the prospectus to Halotel because it lacked some regulatory requirements. After we finalise working on it, the company shares will be floated at the market,” he said.

If the prospectus is approved by CMSA, Halotel Tanzania, which is owned by the Vietnamese government, will be the second to float an IPO behind Vodacom Tanzania, which was listed last year.
 
The quarterly communications statistics report of 2017, shows that Halotel had the lowest tariffs on SMS both locally and internationally, charging Sh30 and Sh95 respectively. Halotel had 3.7 million voice subscribers as of September, last year, which was 9 per cent of the mobile telecom market share.
 
According to the report, 442,512 people subscribed for Halotel mobile money, which made two per cent of total mobile money subscription. Recently, organisers of the International Business Awards (Steve Awards 2017) named Viettel Tanzania PLC, which trades as Halotel Tanzania, as the fastest-growing enterprise in Africa and the Middle East. For the past two years, Halotel Tanzania has managed to register 3.5 million customers, ranking fourth among eight telecoms operating in Tanzania. The firm overtook some mobile operators that have existed longer. Halotel was launched in October 2015 and deployed in all 26 Tanzanian regions. This was Viettel’s fourth investment in Africa after Movitel, Lumitel and Nexttel in Mozambique, Burundi and Cameroon respectively. Viettel started investing in the country in 2011 and planned $736 million in investment after then-President Jakaya Kikwete visited Vietnam.
 
The entry of Viettel also saw further liberalisation of the communication sector, with the government allowing private companies to lay their own optic fibre cables. The company had promised to connect several public institutions around the country with the optic fibre network and connect over 1,500 villages to the telecommunications grid that were previously not served. The company also tried to partner with state-owned energy company Tanzania Electric Supply Company to use the utility firm’s power poles to serve as antennas."
MTN to open $1.2b Uganda IPO to investors in East Africa,https://www.african-markets.com/en/stock-markets/use/mtn-to-open-1-2b-uganda-ipo-to-investors-in-east-africa," October 06, 2021 2:03 PM",2022-07-21 12:26:38.372587,"MTN Uganda will sell a fifth of its stake to Kenyan and other East African investors when it floats its initial public offer (IPO) on the Kampala bourse.
 
The telecom, a South African MTN Group subsidiary, said Tuesday that it had received regulatory approvals to list 20 percent of its shareholding.
 
The firm said Tuesday that it would disclose details of the offer in its prospectus to be released on October 11.
 
Uganda’s Capital Markets Authority (CMA) Chief Executive Keith Kalyegira said the IPO is expected to raise about $1.2 billion.





“The intention to float announcement is a major step towards delivering on our plan to list on the USE,” MTN Uganda chairman Charles Mbire told reporters.
 
The widely anticipated stake sale of the leading telecom in Uganda will be restricted to citizens of the East African Community trading bloc, Ugandan regulators said earlier.
 
Besides Kenya and Uganda, the other members of the EAC are Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.
 
The IPO is expected to boost the number of retail investors at the Uganda Securities Exchange from about 40,000 to 200,000 investors.
 
The listing will make MTN Uganda the second publicly traded telecom in EAC after Safaricom’s IPO on the Nairobi Securities Exchange in 2008.
 
“This will potentially be the largest IPO on the Ugandan market and will be delivered primarily through a digital paperless/ green platform which is the first of its kind in East Africa,” said MTN Uganda in a statement.
 
 
Licence condition
“The offer and listing of MTN Uganda is in line with MTN Group’s localisation plans to drive local ownership in the markets within which MTN operates,” the firm said.
 
The Ugandan government set the listing of telecoms on the local bourse as one of its licence renewal conditions to allow local ownership of big companies with few large shareholders.
 
MTN Group Ltd of South Africa owns more than 90 percent of the company’s shares, while a Ugandan businessman holds less than five percent shares. 
 
MTN Uganda, which has 15 million subscribers, had its operating licence renewed for 12 years in February last year after paying $100 million with the local listing requirement as a precondition for the permit nod.
 
“We are delighted to witness the honouring of this commitment by MTN,” said Irene Kaggwa-Sewankambo, the Executive Director of the Uganda Communications Commission.
 
MTN Uganda was granted two years starting July 1 2020, to list 20 percent of its equity on the Ugandan Securities Exchange.
 
“This IPO gives Ugandans an opportunity to own a piece of the company,” said USE chief executive Paul Bwiso on Tuesday.
 
MTN Uganda started operating in the country in 1998.
 
Although relatively small, Uganda’s telecoms and data market is seen as potentially lucrative because many of the country’s 42 million people are young.
 
Mobile penetration in Uganda grew from 0.27 percent in 1998 to 67 percent as of March 2021 underlining the sector's rapid growth."

Vodacom offered 560,000,100 ordinary shares at a price of 850/- in the country’s biggest share sale opened from March to July after the government ordered all telecommunications companies in the country to sell at least a 25 per cent stake on the Dar es Salaam exchange to boost domestic ownership.
 
“We look forward to the public investors becoming our shareholders and to the listing of our company, and to be part of our company’s vision to lead Tanzania into the digital age and change lives through technology.”
 
It was expected once completed, the IPO will boost the bourse’s capitalisation by at least 2.4 per cent to about 20.7tri/-. This is a significant landmark transaction for the country, being the largest IPO in the history of Tanzania’s capital markets and has attracted more than 40,000 Tanzanian investors, most of whom are first time participants in the capital markets in Tanzania.
 
The CMSA has approved the shareholders’ register reflecting these results, ready for crediting the allotted shares to the respective shareholders’ Central Securities Depository (CSD) accounts.

Minister of the Public Business Sector Hisham Tawfik has said on Monday that preparations are underway to offer stakes in two state-owned companies, including Banque du Caire.
 
Tawfik declared in April that the second wave will involve new sectors that are not listed on the Egyptian Stock Market (EGX) in a bid to attract more investments and energise the stock market, as well as provide cash liquidity in the domestic market.





The governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has announced that Banque du Caire will offer a stake of its shares, ranging between 30 and 40 percent, which is expected to garner between $300 million and $400 million at the most.
 
Official sources say that the government will also offer a share of 10 to 15 percent of E-finance, a national company which is operating the Egyptian government's financial network with a paid capital of EGP 350.5 million, to be the second company offered alongside Banque du Caire.
 
Head of E-finance Ibrahim Sarhan told Ahram Online that the offering ""is subject to the government’s will, it is not a final order.""
 
“We are already working on studying the market. We will finish our work within a month-and-a-half and all the results of our study will be announced in a press conference before the offering process,” Sarhan added.
 
The second phase of the IPO will include new sectors that do not exist on the Egyptian stock exchange, which will attract more investors, Minister Tawfik said.
 
Tawfik added that the strategic objectives of the government’s IPO programme are to expand the ownership base, increase governance practices and private sector participation in management, and provide the necessary financing to restructure and develop companies.
 
He stressed that the offering will be for profitable companies only, noting that good preparation and timing are among the most important guarantees for the success of the proposal process.
 
“It also depends on external factors, including macro-economic, global markets, and other internal factors related to the stability of the company's operations,"" he said.
 
The minister also emphasised the importance of the role of the investor relations officer.
 
In 2016, Egypt announced the launch of the IPO programme by offering a portion of state-owned company’s shares in the EGX to revive the market as part of the country's economic reform programme.
 
The goal from the IPO is to attract investments flows to the domestic market and make ultimate use of state assets.
 
The programme is scheduled to be fully implemented within three to five years over 23 companies and banks in various sectors, including real estate, services, petroleum, and chemicals, targeting to collect approximately EGP 8 billion, according to the financial initial statement of the fiscal year FY2019/20 budget.
 
Previously, in March, Egypt offered a stake of 4.5 percent of Eastern Company’s shares on the EGX with a total value of EGP 1.72 billion. Emirati Mohamed Alabbar and Saudi Arabian investors had acquired more than 25 percent of the company's shares with a total of EGP 400 million."

In his words, “We are happy about the uptake of shares by a broad number of Ghanaians who took advantage of the various avenues provided, especially the MoMo Service to apply for shares. I am particularly excited about the fact that the MoMo Service paved the way for people in urban and rural communities to apply for shares”."
Tanzania: Maxcom On the Threshold of IPO,https://www.african-markets.com/en/stock-markets/dse/tanzania-maxcom-on-the-threshold-of-ipo," January 09, 2018 8:32 PM",2022-07-21 12:26:52.943815,"A leading ICT integration firm in Tanzania, Maxcom Africa Limited, is currently in the final stages of preparing to submit its draft to the Capital Markets and Securities Authority (CMSA) for listing on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE). Mr Raphael Masumbuko – the chief executive officer of Zan Securities Limited, who are providing advisory services to Maxcom – told The Citizen that they were seriously considering February this year as the month in which to launch the company’s initial public offering (IPO).
 
“We’re considering February as the right time to open the IPO because the economy of the country (Tanzania) will be stable –and members of the public would have already finished dealing with their January financial obligations,” he said, referring to the myriad expenses that are usually associated with the month of January such as rent, school fees, etc.
 
“Although it’s not mandatory for Maxcom to launch an IPO, we nonetheless consider February to be the perfect time in which to start an IPO. We expect the company to be listed on the local bourse (DSE) by February or March this year,” the Zan Securities chief stated.

Mr Masumbuko further explained that, apart from Maxcom, several companies have shown interest in listing on the DSE. However, he would not divulge their names or other details, ostensibly because “they were not yet ready for that kind of publicity.”
 
Currently, Maxcom operates in six African countries, namely Tanzania – which hosts the firm’s headquarters – Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and Burundi.
 
The firm’s board chairman, Prof Samwel Wangwe of Tanzania, recently said that the listing would enable the company to freely operate in compliance with the country’s laws and regulations.
 
According to the chairman, the application to go public was aimed at conforming with Tanzania’s Electronic and Postal Communication Act of 2010, and the Finance Act (2016), which requires communications operators to offload a minimum of 25 per cent of their shares on the general public.
 
June last year, Tanzania President John Pombe Magufuli ordered the revocation of operation licences for mobile telephony companies which were not willing, able or ready to list with DSE.
 
In the event, Dr Magufuli directed the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) to act tough against stubborn companies – emphasizing that all mobile phone firms operating in the country were required to float shares on the bourse.
 
Maxcom chairman Wangwe said implementation of the president’s directive would improve the company’s efficiency.
 
In that regard, the good professor stressed that he would strive throughout his term to efficaciously manage the company, and expand its activities within and beyond the country’s borders.
 
“Listing at the DSE will enhance” all that, Prof Wangwe confidently stated."
Tanzania opens telecom IPOs to foreign investors,https://www.african-markets.com/en/stock-markets/dse/tanzania-opens-telecom-ipos-to-foreign-investors," June 24, 2017 10:51 AM",2022-07-21 12:26:55.249245,"The government has advanced a proposal that seeks to ensure investors from East Africa and beyond as well as Tanzanians in diaspora are able to take part in the impending initial public offerings (IPOs).
 
Winding up the debate on the Sh31,7 trillion budget for the Financial Year 2017/18 in Parliament yesterday, the Finance and Planning Minister, Dr Philip Mpango informed the House that the government would amend the Electronic and Postal Communications Act (Epoca) 2010 with a view to allowing investors across the East African Community member states, Tanzanians in diaspora and foreign investors to take part in pending IPOs for telecommunications firms, including those for Airtel Tanzania and Tigo.
 
Going by Epoca 2010, telecommunication firms are required to offload 25 percent of their shares for the public through the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE).

In this regard, Vodacom Tanzania became the first telecommunications firm to issue an IPO early this year in which it sought to raise Sh476 billion by selling 560 million shares at Sh850 each.
 
With capital controls, however, the IPO was only open to local investors and so far, the company has been unable to reveal the IPO results, with pundits speculating that it might have underperformed due to a tight liquidity in the economy.
 
The Vodacom Tanzania PLC’s IPO ended on May 11 and subsequent listing was scheduled for June 12 but it has remained silent — including on revealing the IPO outcomes — since then, causing anxiety among some of its new investors.
 
The company’s MD, Mr Ian Ferrao, told The Citizen on Monday that Vodacom was only awaiting regulatory approvals from capital markets authorities to go ahead with listing after a total of 40,000 new investors bought shares.
 
But speaking after eight Cabinet ministers and his deputy, Dr Ashatu Kijaji responded to some other issues as raised by MPs during the six days of the budget debate, Dr Mpango, said the government is amending the Epoca 2010 — probably through the Finance Bills 2017 — so as to allow more investors to take part in telecommunication firms’ IPOs.
 
“If a company that will have issued an IPO and fails to raise the required amount, the relevant ministry will come up with a modality that will guide it (the company) on how to raise the entire money as required by the law,” he said."
SPAC volatility forces SeatGeek and Billy Beane of 'Moneyball' fame to shelve merger plans as the boom in blank-check deals fades,https://africa.businessinsider.com/markets/spac-volatility-forces-seatgeek-and-billy-beane-of-moneyball-fame-to-shelve-merger/q13n0ez,"June 1, 2022 8:46 PM",2022-07-21 12:24:55.525785,"A merger deal between RedBall Acquisition, a special acquisition purpose company led in part by Oakland A's executive Billy Beane, and ticket platform SeatGeek has ended, the companies said Wednesday.
    




        ""[Given] current market conditions, it was mutually determined that the best option for all parties at this time is for SeatGeek to remain private,"" Andy Gordon, a partner at investment firm RedBird Capital, said on behalf of RedBall in a statement.
    




        The SPAC said in October it was in talks with SeatGeek about a potential deal. RedBall shares were up 6% during Wednesday's session, trading near $10.
    




        ""Unfavorable"" market conditions are ""particularly impacting growth technology companies,"" the companies said Wednesday. SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, usually merge with high-growth tech companies aiming to avoid the traditional IPO process.
    




        The RedBall termination comes at a time when the broader stock market has been rocked lower by recession fears and a fast pickup in bond yields.
    




        Tech stocks as measured by the Nasdaq Composite have tumbled more than 20% this year, hitting bear-market territory, as increased borrowing costs hurt earnings potential.
    




        Meanwhile, the boom in SPACs in 2020 and 2021 has slowed this year in the face of increased scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission. There have been 67 SPAC initial public offerings in 2022, down from 613 in 2021 and 248 in 2020, according to SPAC Research."

And it has its eyes set on foreign investors, particularly those in the United States of America and Italy.
    




        Business Insider Africa understands that the Ugandan Government had to shift focus to foreign investors following disappointment from some regional governments who, though initially showed interest in taking up equity stakes in the project, have failed to commit financially.
    




        According to The East African, the project was expected to take off in 2018 but has not, due to this lack of commitment from the regional investors. The Ugandan Government is now targeting 2027 for takeoff, provided it is able to secure the needed funds from the foreign investors whom it is currently prospecting. 
    




        Over in Nigeria, the country's formerly state-owned energy company has officially transitioned into a commercial venture. During an elabourate ceremony in Abuja yesterday, the company's new name was officially unveiled as NNPC Ltd.
    




        Group CEO, Mele Kyari, also told reporters that plans are underway to launch an Initial Public Offering (IPO) for the company by mid-2023.
    




""We are convinced that by the middle of next year, this company will be IPO ready, which means that you have the system, processes, and a company that is accountable to its stakeholders and shareholders,"" Mele Kyari was quoted by Reuters to have said.
    




        There are high expectations for NNPC Ltd as a private company. One of these expectations is that the company will, henceforth, start conducting its business affairs in a profitable manner. 
    




        Recall that the company, which has been in operation since 1977, disclosed its financial statements to the public for the first time in 2020, much to the dismay of many Nigerians. The financial report had shown some $3.6 billion (N1.5 trillion) accumulated losses over the years, with auditors (including PwC and SIAO Partners0 raising concerns over the oil company's ability to continue as a going concern."

        Musk said in the meeting that Starlink, which is owned by SpaceX, needs to be ""in a smooth sailing situation"" with ""good predictability,"" per the recording.
    




        When Starlink reaches this point, taking it public would ""make a lot of sense,"" Musk told SpaceX workers, according to the recording obtained by CNBC.
    




        During the meeting, Musk warned staff they ""should not think of things going public as, like, a sure path to riches,"" CNBC reported from the audio recording.
    




        The billionaire described stock markets as ""fickle"" and ""really pistol-whip you if you don't meet expectations,"" per the recording.
    




        ""Being public is definitely an invitation to pain,"" Musk told SpaceX employees, according to the recording cited by CNBC.
    




        SpaceX didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
    




        His revised date means Starlink's IPO has been delayed once again for another three years. In an email to SpaceX workers in 2019, also obtained by CNBC, Musk gave a three-year timeline for Starlink's public offering, meaning an IPO could have taken place this year.
    




        In 2020, Musk tweeted that Starlink would ""probably IPO"" in ""several years."" He then tweeted in June 2021 that it would be ""at least a few years before Starlink revenue is reasonably predictable"" and taking it public any earlier would be ""very painful.""
    




        Musk has maintained that the timing must be right for Starlink to go public. He said in February 2021 that SpaceX has to go through ""a deep chasm of negative cash flow"" over the next year to make Starlink financially viable.
    




        Eventually, Musk wants Starlink to make revenues of between $30 billion and $50 billion a year."
Bill Ackman's SPAC has just 6 weeks to find a target &mdash; or he'll have to return $4 billion to investors,https://africa.businessinsider.com/markets/bill-ackmans-spac-has-just-6-weeks-to-find-a-target-andmdash-or-hell-have-to-return/7j0bmx5,"June 9, 2022 12:17 PM",2022-07-21 12:25:28.617540,"Billionaire investor Bill Ackman is running out of time to find a target for his $4 billion special purpose acquisition company.
    




Pershing Square Tontine Holdings needs to identify a company to acquire within the next six weeks, or Ackman will have to return all its cash to his investors.
    




        A SPAC raises money by listing on the stock market and then aims to merge with a private company within a set timeframe. Ackman's blank-check vehicle went public on July 22, 2020. Sponsors have to dissolve their SPAC within two years of listing if they are unable to identify an acquisition target.
    




        Ackman scrapped his plan to buy a stake in Universal Music last year, citing opposition to the deal from the Securities and Exchange Commission. PSTH is yet to identify a replacement target and its stock has plummeted to 5.7% below its initial $21.10 listing price since that deal was nixed.
    




Ackman has subsequently urged the SEC to extend its deadline, but it's looking increasingly likely that he'll have to return $4 billion worth of cash to PSTH's initial investors.
    




        ""Unless Ackman comes up with some magic in an extremely volatile and uncertain market, he will be returning the $4 billion,"" Jim Osman, founder of the Edge Consulting Group, told Insider.
    




        SPACs raised $96 billion in the first quarter of 2021 alone, according to the Harvard Business Review, but the industry has struggled since that initial boom. Morgan Creek's Exos SPAC Originated ETF, which tracks these vehicles, has plummeted 47.8% over the past year.
    




        One issue is that SPACs tend to merge with high-growth, low cash-flow companies that want to avoid the traditional IPO process. These sorts of stocks have struggled in 2022 due to rising interest rates, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 entering bear market territory.
    




        ""With monetary policies tightening, speculative bubbles are bursting one after the other, Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Syz Bank, said. SPACs are no exception.
    




        ""Bill and Pershing face an uphill battle,"" Edge Consulting's Osman added. ""Selling SPACs to investors is now virtually impossible.""

The company is JD.com's Hong Kong-listed subsidiary that focuses on healthcare products and online medical consultation.
    




        Since late May, Liu has sold about 15.1 million, or about $907 million, of shares in the company, per a June 19 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. JD.com is listed on Nasdaq.
    




        Liu founded JD.com in 1998. The company quickly grew to become an ecommerce giant and was at times compared to Amazon, while Liu was sometimes called the ""Jeff Bezos of China.""

        In the last two years, China has launched probes aimed atbreaking up tech companies even as it has strengthened its control over data securityand sought tolimit consumers' usageof internet and gaming platforms.
    




        Even though Beijing seemed to berelaxing its approach in recent weeks, China's ""old guard"" tech moguls have largely vacated leadership rolesat the companies they founded during its two-year crackdown.

David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, has tasked Salisbury with one of his most prized initiatives: building its asset management business into a juggernaut.
 8cdba64a-f945-47a9-a2d9-30220436e0d2








1. Goldman Sachs will reduce the ""velocity"" of its hiring, and won't fill some roles that are vacated through natural attrition. The bank has also reduced compensation expenses for the first half of this year by $3.5 billion versus the same period in 2021, Chief Financial Officer Denis Coleman told analysts during Goldman's second-quarter earnings call on Monday.
    




        Goldman also warned it will reintroduce its annual performance reviews, something it put on hold during the earlier stages of the pandemic. Banks have used such reviews to purge their workforces of under-performing bankers. Historically, Goldman's performance checks have led to the bottom 5% of the staff being laid off.
    




        Weak earnings, particularly in firms' investment-banking divisions, have folks braced for job cuts as Wall Street firms come to terms with a volatile market and high inflation. That's contributed to a slump in dealmaking. M&A volumes are down 21% year-over-year, and fees from equity capital markets are down 72%.
    




And it's not just dealmakers that are fearing cuts. College grads are concerned that their full-time offers might dwindle, too.
    




        BlackRock also told staffers that it's scaling back hiring plans on the back of economic uncertainty, Insider previously reported.
    




        Wall Street firms' adoption of hiring freezes comes just months after many showered bankers with handsome bonuses. Dealmaking soared in the first two years of the pandemic as cheap money and high company valuations prompted firms to tap the capital markets for debt, or to go public via IPO, or through a tie up with a special purpose acquisition vehicle, or SPAC.
    




        Today, however, the sharp dip in revenues in investment banking has prompted a sea change across Wall Street.
    




        Here's everything we know about banks' belt tightening efforts and how it will impact jobs and pay.

Bill Ackman says he'll return $4 billion to PSTH investors after failing to close a SPAC deal; and trumpets his next-generation SPARC,https://africa.businessinsider.com/markets/bill-ackman-says-hell-return-dollar4-billion-to-psth-investors-after-failing-to-close/wy86nd1,"July 12, 2022 12:55 PM",2022-07-21 12:25:42.836509,"The Pershing Square boss explained in a letter to investors on Monday that when he launched PSTH, he expected the COVID-19 pandemic to continue disrupting capital markets for a while, making his SPAC an attractive alternative to a traditional initial public offering (IPO) for a private company seeking to list its shares.
    




        However, the US stock market and economy bounced back in a matter of months.
    




        ""The rapid recovery of the capital markets and our economy were good for America but unfortunate for PSTH, as it made the conventional IPO market a strong competitor and a preferred alternative for high-quality businesses seeking to go public,"" Ackman said.
    




        The billionaire investor also blamed the ""extremely poor"" performance of SPACs during the pandemic, saying it weighed on sentiment towards the vehicles. Moreover, he cited high redemption rates that ate into post-merger capital, increased the dilution from outstanding stock warrants, and fueled uncertainty about SPAC deals.
    




        Ackman pointed to the lawsuit against PSTH, and regulators' proposed new rules for SPACs in March, as other factors that made it tough to close a transaction. He also noted that exceptional businesses can often postpone going public until market conditions improve, limiting the number of potential targets for PSTH.
    




        The Pershing Square chief added that PSTH did agree to purchase a stake in Universal Media Group as part of its spin-off from Vivendi last year, but scrapped the deal in the face of regulatory pushback.
    




        Ackman ended his letter on an optimistic note. He asserted that SPAC and IPO markets have basically been shut down by the ongoing market turmoil, making it a great time to launch his proposed special-purpose acquisition rights company (SPARC).
    




        The investor and his team are still seeking approval for the product, which wouldn't tie up investors' cash or face a two-year deadline like a SPAC. If they get the green light from regulators, they intend to distribute rights to holders of PSTH shares or warrants as of the market close on July 25. The rights would allow investors to buy into the SPARC at a fixed price once it strikes a merger deal.
    




        ""We are disappointed that we did not achieve our initial objective of consummating a high-quality transaction for PSTH,"" Ackman said in the letter. ""We look forward to the opportunity to continue to work on your behalf once SPARC is successfully launched.""

 FREMONT, Calif., July  05, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — AXT, Inc. (NasdaqGS: AXTI), a leading manufacturer of compound semiconductor wafer substrates, today announced that its wafer manufacturing subsidiary in China, Beijing Tongmei Xtal Technology Co., Ltd. (“Tongmei”), submitted to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange accepted for review, additional documents as the next step in the process of listing Tongmei’s shares in an initial public offering (the “IPO”) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s Sci-Tech innovAtion boaRd (the “STAR Market”). This is the fourth round of submissions and conforms to the normal processes and steps toward a listing on the STAR Market. Management Qualitative Comments “We believe we are making good progress on the IPO,” said Morris Young, chief executive officer. “The initial filing was formally accepted for review by the Shanghai Stock Exchange on January 10, 2022. Since then, we have replied to two rounds of questions. The recent submission is our fourth filing and updates items previously submitted as well as provides new information, including additional financial information presented under the Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises under Chinese generally accepted accounting principles (“Chinese GAAP”). It is important for our investors to understand that Tongmei’s results do not equate to AXT, Inc.’s results and that Chinese GAAP can differ materially from U.S. GAAP. AXT is not updating the guidance we provided on April 28, 2022 for Q2 2022. As we continue to work through the IPO process, we are encouraged by the progress of our application. I am proud of our team for their diligence and appreciate the support and guidance from our investment bank and law firm in China.” STAR Market Listing Update  In conjunction with the IPO process, the Shanghai Stock Exchange posted on its website certain consolidated financial results for Tongmei for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and Tongmei’s preliminary expectations for those financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Tongmei’s financial results were determined in accordance with Chinese GAAP and consisted of the following: The preliminary estimates of revenue and net profit set forth above with respect to the six-month period ended June 30, 2022 reflect the consolidated, stand-alone results of Tongmei in RMB as prepared in accordance with Chinese GAAP, and those results will differ, potentially materially, from AXT, Inc’s consolidated revenue and net profit for the period, which will reflect additional financial and operational items and will be prepared in U.S. dollars in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”). The process of going public on the STAR Market includes several periods of review and, therefore, is a lengthy process. Tongmei expects to accomplish this goal in the  second half of 2022.

Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.  Solana (“SOL Tokens”)  Class Period: March 24, 2020 – Present  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 6, 2022  According to the lawsuit, Solana issues securities that are required to be, but are not, registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants promoted SOL securities (SOL tokens) and sold them to investors, who has suffered losses from purchasing SOL securities.  For more information on the Solana class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SOL  Missfresh Limited (NASDAQ: MF)  Class Period: Pursuant to the Company’s June 25, 2021 IPO  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 12, 2021  Missfresh purports to be an innovator and leader in China’s neighborhood retail industry which invented the Distributed Mini Warehouse (DMW) model to operate an integrated online-and-offline on-demand retail business focusing on offering fresh produce and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs).  On or about June 8, 2021, Missfresh filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form F-1, which in combination with a subsequent amendment on Form F-1/A and filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4), would be used for the IPO.  On June 23, 2021, Missfresh filed with the SEC its final prospectus for the IPO on Form 424B4 (the “Prospectus”), which forms part of the Registration Statement. In the IPO, Missfresh sold approximately 21 million American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) at $13.00 per ADS.  On April 29, 2022, after trading hours, Missfresh filed with the SEC a Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 which announced, among other things, that the independent Audit Committee of the Company’s board of directors, with the assistance of professional advisors, “[wa]s in the process of conducting an internal review of certain matters, including those relating to transactions between the Company and certain third-party enterprises.” On this news, Missfresh ADSs fell 13% to close at $0.448 per ADS on May 2, 2021.  Then, on May 24, 2022, Missfresh disclosed that the Company was unable to file its 2021 Annual Report by the extended deadline, ""primarily because the Company is unable to complete the audit of the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021"". On this news, Missfresh's ADSs fell $0.018 per share, or 9.7%, over the following two trading days, to close at $0.167 per ADS on May 26, 2022.  Finally, on July 1, 2022, Missfresh issued a press release entitled ""Missfresh Announces the Substantial Completion of the Audit Committee-Led Independent Internal Review"" which disclosed, among other things, that the Company's review ""identified certain transactions . . . that exhibit characteristics of questionable transactions, such as undisclosed relationships between suppliers and customers, different customers or suppliers sharing the same contact information, and/or lack of supporting logistics information"" and that consequently, ""certain revenue associated with those reporting periods in 2021 may have been inaccurately recorded in the Company's financial statements.""  Since the IPO, the price of Missfresh's ADSs has fallen over 97%, closing at $0.3075 per ADS on July 6, 2022.  The class action alleges that Defendants’ statements in the Registration Statement were materially false and misleading when made because: (1) Missfresh provided false financial figures in its Registration Statement; (2) Missfresh would need to amend its financial figures; (3) Missfresh, among other things, had lesser net revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2021; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times and negligently prepared.  For more information on the Missfresh class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MF  Molecular Partners AG (NASDAQ: MOLN)  Class Period: June 16, 2021 – April 26, 2022 or pursuant to the Company’s June 16, 2021 IPO  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 12, 2022  Molecular Partners operates as a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapeutic proteins. Leading up to and following the IPO, the Company repeatedly touted the clinical and commercial prospects of certain of its product candidates under development in collaboration with other companies.  Among other product candidates, Molecular Partners is developing ensovibep as a treatment for COVID-19 in collaboration with Novartis AG (“Novartis”). One of the Company’s most important development strategies for ensovibep includes securing Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) for ensovibep from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).  In addition, Molecular Partners is developing MP0310 (AMG 506) for the treatment of certain types of cancer in collaboration with Amgen Inc. (“Amgen”). The Company granted Amgen, among other licenses, the right to progress MP0310’s development program into later stage development, including into combination trials, following Phase 1 data.  On April 22, 2021, Molecular Partners filed a registration statement on Form F-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in connection with the IPO, which, after several amendments, was declared effective by the SEC on June 15, 2021 (the “Registration Statement”).  On June 16, 2021, Molecular Partners filed a prospectus on Form 424B4 with the SEC in connection with the IPO, which incorporated and formed part of the Registration Statement (collectively, the “Offering Documents”).  Pursuant to the Offering Documents, Molecular Partners conducted the IPO, issuing 3 million of its ADSs to the public at the IPO price $21.25 per ADS, for proceeds to the Company of over $59 million, after underwriting discounts and commissions, and before expenses.  On November 16, 2021, Molecular Partners disclosed that “a planned futility analysis of ensovibep in [an] ongoing [Phase 3] clinical study . . . has not met the thresholds required to continue enrollment of adults with COVID-19 in the hospitalized setting.”  On this news, Molecular Partners’ ADS price fell $4.64 per ADS, or 31.37%, to close at $10.15 per ADS on November 16, 2021.  On April 26, 2022, months after applying for EUA from the FDA for ensovibep, Novartis’ Chief Executive Officer, Vas Narasimhan, disclosed that “given the latest feedback . . . in our discussions with the [FDA], we would expect the agency to require a Phase 3 study before granting an EUA approval or a general approval” for ensovibep, and that “we need to make a kind of sober evaluation as to is it a doable study in light of the waning rates of COVID around the world[.]”  On this news, Molecular Partners’ ADS price fell $2.68 per ADS, or 16.17%, to close at $13.89 per ADS on April 26, 2022.   Then, also on April 26, 2022, during after-market hours, Molecular Partners “announced that Amgen . . . has informed the Company of their decision to return global rights of MP0310 to Molecular Partners following a strategic pipeline review.”  On this news, Molecular Partners’ ADS price fell $5.19 per ADS, or 37.37%, to close at $8.70 per ADS on April 27, 2022—a total decline of $7.87 per ADS, or 47.5%, over two consecutive trading days, and 59.06% below the $21.25 per ADS IPO price.  As of the time the complaint was filed, the price of Molecular Partners’ ADSs continued to trade below the $21.25 per ADS IPO price, damaging investors.  The complaint alleges that the Offering Documents were negligently prepared and, as a result, contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and were not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their preparation. Additionally, the complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Offering Documents and Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) ensovibep was less effective at treating COVID-19 than Defendants had led investors to believe; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was reasonably likely to require an additional Phase 3 study of ensovibep before granting the drug EUA; (iii) waning global rates of COVID-19 significantly reduced the Company’s chances of securing EUA for ensovibep; (iv) as a product candidate, MP0310 was less attractive to Amgen than Defendants had led investors to believe; (v) accordingly, there was a significant likelihood that Amgen would return global rights of MP0310 to Molecular Partners; (vi) as a result of all the foregoing, the clinical and commercial prospects of ensovibep and MP0310 were overstated; and (vii) as a result, the Offering Documents and Defendants’ public statements throughout the Class Period were materially false and/or misleading and failed to state information required to be stated therein.

"ROSEN, GLOBAL INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Molecular Partners AG Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action – MOLN",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/07/20/2483100/673/en/ROSEN-GLOBAL-INVESTOR-COUNSEL-Encourages-Molecular-Partners-AG-Investors-to-Secure-Counsel-Before-Important-Deadline-in-Securities-Class-Action-MOLN.html,"July 20, 2022 14:00 ET",2022-07-21 12:24:30.176616,"NEW YORK, July  20, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Molecular Partners AG (NASDAQ: MOLN): (i) pursuant and/or traceable to the offering documents issued in connection with the Company’s initial public offering conducted on or about June 16, 2021 (the “IPO”); and/or (ii) between June 16, 2021 and April 26, 2022, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 12, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline.  SO WHAT: If you purchased Molecular Partners securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.  WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Molecular Partners class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=7548 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 12, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.  WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.  DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the IPO documents were negligently prepared and, as a result, contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and were not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their preparation. Additionally, the complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the IPO documents and defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) ensovibep was less effective at treating COVID-19 than defendants had led investors to believe; (2) accordingly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) was reasonably likely to require an additional Phase 3 study of ensovibep before granting the drug Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”); (3) waning global rates of COVID-19 significantly reduced the Company’s chances of securing EUA for ensovibep; (4) as a product candidate, MP0310 (AMG 506), in development for the treatment of certain types of cancer,  was less attractive to Amgen Inc. (“Amgen”) than defendants had led investors to believe; (5) accordingly, there was a significant likelihood that Amgen would return global rights of MP0310 to Molecular Partners; (6) as a result of all the foregoing, the clinical and commercial prospects of ensovibep and MP0310 were overstated; and (7) as a result, the IPO documents and defendants’ public statements throughout the Class Period were materially false and/or misleading and failed to state information required to be stated therein. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

TLI initial public offering marks full subscription,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2336673/tli-initial-public-offering-marks-full-subscription,30 Jun 2022,2022-07-21 12:24:08.584067,"Thai Life Insurance's (TLI) initial share allotment from Financial Syrus Securities (FSS) was fully subscribed on its first day yesterday in the region's largest initial public offering (IPO) by an insurance firm since 2000.FSS's IPO portion of 25 million shares, out of 2.155 billion shares, was fully bidded within 30 minutes, the underwriter said.
The securities firm said investors can check the results of yesterday's subscriptions today.
If the subscription was unsuccessful, they will receive a full refund in their cash balance accounts within three operating days.
TLI is seeking to raise 34.48 billion baht with the IPO price set at 16 baht per share, a price-per-earning ratio of 22 times and a price-per-book of 2.13 times.
Shares of TLI are expected to be listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) by the end of next month.
Despite the high volatility of the stock market, TLI received an excellent response from investors thanks to the public's trust in TLI, Thailand's first life insurance company that has been operating for 80 years.
""TLI had the highest offering value for a life insurance company in the history of the SET,"" FSS said.
After the IPO, TLI's market capitalisation will stand at 183.2 billion baht, among the SET's top 25, making the company eligible for the fast track to be included in the SET50 Index in the second half.
According to the SET, the three largest insurance companies by market cap as of June 27 are Bangkok Life Assurance, Dhipaya Group Holdings and TQM Corporation.
In addition, TLI shares reportedly attracted 18 cornerstone institutional investors showing interest in subscribing.
The most prominent is CIG Private Ltd, the Singapore government's private fund, which subscribed 362.50 million shares.
TLI shares also received a warm response from domestic institutional investors such as SCB Asset Management and Kasikorn Asset Management, which subscribed 181.50 million shares and 156.25 million shares, respectively.
Chai Chaiyawan, president of TLI, said the IPO proceeds will be used to strengthen TLI's businesses and enhance its potential by becoming a data-driven company.
Using strategic data analysis and digital transformation through innovation, the company will be able to improve the integrated workflow, accelerate the service process, strengthen distribution channels through partners and enhance its working capital, he said.
As of March 31, TLI has more than 4.4 million active policies. "
Chinese fintech giant Ant closer to reviving iPO,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2328598/chinese-fintech-giant-ant-closer-to-reviving-ipo,17 Jun 2022,2022-07-21 12:24:10.017331,"A thermal imaging camera is seen in front of the Ant Group headquarters in Hangzhou, China. (Reuters file Photo)												

HONG KONG: China’s central bank has accepted an application by Ant Group to set up a financial holding company, a key step toward finishing a year-long overhaul of Alibaba founder Jack Ma’s fintech business and reviving its stock market debut.The expected approval by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is the latest sign that Ant, a tech giant with financial businesses stretching from payments to wealth management, is poised to emerge from a regulatory crackdown that humbled one of the country’s best-known tycoons.
The PBOC this month accepted Ant’s application, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, amid investor hopes that Chinese regulators are easing a crackdown on private enterprises that started in late 2020, as growth slows in the world’s second-largest economy due to Covid-19 curbs.
Ant and the PBOC did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on Friday.
New York-listed shares of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth of which Ant is an affiliate, jumped nearly 10% on Friday shortly after the Reuters report.
Although Ant has been working with financial regulators for months on a broad revamp, the central bank’s agreement to review the application signals the company could get its long-awaited licence soon, said the sources, who asked not to be named due to confidentiality constraints.
Chinese authorities abruptly pulled the plug on Ant’s IPO, set to raise $37 billion in the world’s biggest listing, in November 2020, soon after billionaire Ma gave a speech in which he complained that financial watchdogs were stifling innovation in China.
Cracking down on Ma’s business empire, the authorities put Ant, whose businesses span payment processing, consumer lending to insurance products distribution, under the revamp.
As part of that overhaul, the PBOC in December 2020 told Reuters that Ant was drafting a plan to set up a financial holding firm and should ensure that all its financial operations were placed under regulatory supervision.
Ant had been valued as a tech firm for its IPO, but the forced change to a financial holding company will make it subject to capital requirements and regulations similar to those for banks.
Reuters reported last week that China’s central leadership had given Ant a tentative green light to revive its IPO in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
Aiming to file a preliminary prospectus for the share offering as early as next month, Ant is awaiting final feedback from financial regulators, especially the PBOC, on the set-up of the financial holding firm, one source said.
To formally revive its mega-listing, Ant has to secure the key financial holding license and complete its restructuring, the sources said.
The scuttled IPO marked the start of the crackdown that hit China’s technology giants and was quickly extended to other sectors, including property and private education, wiping billions off market values and triggering layoffs at some firms.
Beijing, however, has softened its stance in the last few months. Vice-Premier Liu He told tech executives last month the government supported the development of the sector.
Apart from the financial holding company license, Ant’s personal credit-scoring joint venture has applied for a permit, as part of the fintech major’s business revamp.
The central bank has mostly finished vetting the credit scoring licence, said another source with direct knowledge of the matter, after having accepted the application for the unit in November.
Ant has agreed to establish the JV with partners including three state-owned companies under a plan allowing state-backed investors to take a combined 48% stake in its key asset — a data treasure trove of over 1 billion users.
Ant will own 35% of the venture, and the only non-state-backed shareholder, Transfar Group, will hold 7%, while Hangzhou Xishu will get the remaining 10%, the PBOC said in November.
Hangzhou Xishu is an entity that operates employee stock ownership plans.
But recently, regulators have suggested further tweaks of the shareholding structure to increase the holdings of state investors.
Ant, via the super-app Alipay, collects data from over 1 billion users, many of whom are young, internet-savvy people without credit cards or sufficient bank credit records, as well as 80 million merchants, according to analysts and its IPO prospectus. "
Index revives plan to list after buyback,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2341902/index-revives-plan-to-list-after-buyback,8 Jul 2022,2022-07-21 12:24:11.579031,"Index Creative Village Plc, an event organiser and marketing service company, has refreshed its plan to list on the Market for Alternative Investment (MAI) after it bought back a 50% stake from Wave Entertainment in April.Kriengkrai Kanjanapokin, the company's founder and group chief executive, said that the firm has spent 410 million baht to repurchase 50% of its shares from Wave Entertainment, leading its share ownership to a combined 93.6%.
The remaining 6.38% belongs to the Maleenont family, owner of BEC World Plc, the operator of Channel 3.
SET-listed Wave Entertainment acquired a 50% stake in event organiser Index Creative Village for 430 million baht as part of its plans to become a lifestyle and entertainment leader in Asean in 2015.
""We've repurchased our stake because we want to transform our firm into a 'real & digital Xperience' provider. We are finding new business partners to support our digital move,"" he said.

According to Mr Kriengkrai, the company expects to achieve the listing plan on the MAI over the next two years to raise funds for future expansion.
The company delayed its IPO plan since 2020 due to the Covid-19 outbreaks.
He said the company has resumed its investment since early this year after the overall event industry rebounded in the first half of 2022 owing to the improvement in the Covid-19 situation.
Businesses have also begun to restart promotional activities for their products and services, while marketers have started using their budgets to launch events for products and services in a variety of industries including real estate, consumer products, automobile, banking and leasing, investment, technology and innovation, and fashion.
""We expect the entertainment event business to see a full recovery in the fourth quarter. We believe the overall event and organising business will see a full recovery in 2023 if there are no big negative incidents occurring next year,"" said Mr Kriengkrai.
He projects the company's revenue in 2022 to increase by 54% from the previous year to 965 million baht and get back to the pre-crisis level of 1.5 billion baht next year.
Index reported 628 million baht in total revenue in 2021. Some 56% came from creative business development, 35% from marketing service and 9% from its own projects.
""We survived over the last two years because we have put more focus on creating our own projects. We now aim to boost the revenue portion from our own projects to 50% of total revenue within 2024 from 20% this year,"" he said.
In a move to ramp up its digital business expansion, the company recently teamed up with D.OASIS ""Sandbox Metaverse"", a world-class virtual world, and 30 corporate partners to establish the metaverse ecosystem and integrate business to entertainment, creativity, education and lifestyle. "

Further waves of reckoning swept through the cryptocurrency industry on Tuesday, with exchange company Coinbase Global Inc. saying it would cut almost a fifth of its staff and crypto lender Celsius Network LLC hiring a law firm to examine restructuring options.Coinbase, one of the signal growth companies of the crypto boom, said it was slashing its workforce by 1,100 employees, or about 18% of its staff, because the company had grown too quickly and a potential recession ""could lead to another crypto winter.""
In a letter to employees, chief executive Brian Armstrong said ""our employee costs are too high to effectively manage this uncertain market.""
""We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom,"" Mr. Armstrong wrote. ""A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period. In past crypto winters, trading revenue (our largest revenue source) has declined significantly.""
Meanwhile, Celsius, one of the largest crypto lenders, tapped attorneys from law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP to advise on solutions for its mounting financial problems, people familiar with the matter said.
Celsius had told users on Sunday night that it was pausing all withdrawals, swaps and transfers between accounts because of extreme market conditions, adding more turbulence to cryptocurrency prices.
A spokeswoman for Akin Gump had no immediate comment. Celsius executives didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
The destruction in crypto markets has been broad and deep, with roughly $2 trillion of value having been erased across numerous cryptocurrencies since November, when bitcoin -- the most mainstream of them -- hit an all-time high of $67,802.30.
Investors have continued to unload assets viewed as risky, like cryptocurrencies and technology stocks, while the Federal Reserve tries to tame the highest inflation in the U.S. in decades.
The S&P 500 stock index entered a bear market this week as investors expect the Fed to further raise interest rates.
As of 5 p.m. ET Tuesday, bitcoin traded at $21,991.89, down 5.4% for the day and 68% below its all-time high.
Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that was started as a joke but became established enough to be mentioned by Elon Musk on Saturday Night Live, peaked at 67.4 cents in May of 2021 and has crashed by 92% since.
Coinbase, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., has struggled to hang on to users this year as the frenzy in digital assets cooled and markets have been rocky.
In May, Coinbase said it lost hundreds of millions of dollars in the first quarter as its trading fees dropped sharply.
The number of Coinbase's transacting users also slid, and the company said it expected trading volumes and users to drop again in the second quarter.
Since the earnings report, things have gotten worse for cryptocurrency prices, Coinbase's stock and markets in general.
Coinbase's IPO last year was deemed a watershed moment for the crypto industry, which had started a decade before as an experiment in digital money.
Its debut was hailed by some as similar to when other sector-defining companies went public, such as Netscape in the 1990s.
When Coinbase -- which says it is ""remote-first"" and doesn't maintain a headquarters -- went public, the first trade of its stock was at $381, and shares rose as high as $429.54. On Wednesday, it closed at $51.58.
Last week, Mr. Armstrong tweeted criticism of a petition by Coinbase employees to remove some executives, not including him, from the company because ""the executive team has recently been making decisions that are not in the best interests of the Company, its employees, and its shareholders.""
In a June 10 Twitter thread that spanned 16 tweets, Mr. Armstrong said, ""if you have no confidence in the execs or CEO of a company then why are you working at that company? Quit and find a company to work at that you believe in!""
Coinbase said it expects to have 5,000 staffers following the layoffs and that laid-off employees will get at least 14 weeks of severance pay.
Other crypto-focused companies have recently announced layoffs as crypto prices have plunged.
BlockFi, a crypto trading and lending platform, said Monday it would reduce its head count by 20% as it said ""the macroeconomic environment has shifted dramatically.""
The CEO of Crypto.com, the company that recently put its name on the Los Angeles Lakers' arena and ran a Super Bowl ad featuring LeBron James, said his firm would make ""targeted reductions"" of about 5% of its workforce, or 260 jobs.
Earlier in June, crypto exchange Gemini Trust Co. cut 10% of its staff, citing the effects of the market downturn.
The layoffs come after a hiring boom as crypto grew in value. Crypto firms' hiring had doubled from November to April, according to data collected by ManpowerGroup.

TLI plans to develop into sustainable firm through listing,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2327448/tli-plans-to-develop-into-sustainable-firm-through-listing,16 Jun 2022,2022-07-21 12:24:21.799725,"Mr Chai said the company experienced a minimal impact from the pandemic as it did not offer any non-life Covid insurance products with a lump-sum payment.												

Thai Life Insurance (TLI) is raising funds through an initial public offering (IPO) this year to strengthen the company's business development potential and support its vision of becoming a sustainable firm.According to Chai Chaiyawan, president of TLI, the company reported total premiums of 19.5 billion baht and first-year premiums of 2.91 billion in the first quarter, up 33.7% from the same period last year, mainly due to profits from investments tallying 2.24 billion baht, up 15%.
TLI's first-quarter single premiums stood at 1.37 billion baht, up 7.6% from the same period last year, while annual renewal premiums stood at 15.2 billion, with a policy retention rate of 88.6%.
Mr Chai said amid intense volatility and economic uncertainties, TLI aims to become a sustainable company by offering comprehensive life and health insurance products and personal financial planning to customers at every stage of life.
In terms of product sales strategies, TLI aims to maintain its market share and increase profitability by focusing on investment-linked life insurance products, participating products that pay dividends to policyholders as well as health insurance products that meet consumer demand.
He said the company wants to increase sales among existing customers by promoting second policies and expand its base to high net worth customers through the sale of family health insurance plans and first policies.
To increase sales volume, Mr Chai said TLI will expand its distribution channels via its digital platform and online partners to approach customers during periods of social distancing and to reduce face-to-face interaction.
He said the company experienced a minimal impact from the pandemic as it did not offer any non-life Covid insurance products with a lump-sum payment.
In the first quarter of 2022, TLI's payments related to medical expenses stood at 8% of total expenses, while claims related to Covid insurance reached 474 million baht.
Mr Chai said thanks to increased profits and the limited effect from the pandemic, the company's financial status remains strong, with a capital adequacy ratio of 361% as of March 31.
""2022 is a very important year for Thai Life Insurance because it marks our 80th anniversary of operations and we plan to go public, becoming a sustainable life insurance company that creates stability in life and finances for Thais,"" he said.
TLI is preparing for the IPO of ordinary shares this year, said Mr Chai. "

After 80 years in business, Thai Life Insurance (TLI), the country's second largest life insurer, is going public in 2022 to enable sustainable growth through digital transformation, business expansion and improvement of corporate governance.TLI filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and plans to list on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). It appointed Capital Nomura Securities and Kiatnakin Phatra Securities as financial advisors for the offering.
According to FSS International Investment Advisory research, TLI plans to float 2.207 billion shares, including 850 million new shares and 1,218.82 million existing shares, comprising 19.3% of the company's total shares.
The company will also offer a greenshoe option for over-allotment of no more than 320.8 million shares from Her Sing (H.K.), the company's shareholder.
TLI's major shareholder is the Chaiwan family, which has businesses covering insurance, banking and other sectors.
SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS
TLI chief executive Chai Chaiwan said the company filed a registration statement and draft prospectus with the SEC for the IPO to offer approximately 20% of the company's total shares. There may be an excess allocation of up to 15% of all ordinary shares offered for sale, said Mr Chai.
The company expects to list this year, its 80th year in operation.
He said being listed on the SET will help raise funds for the company's plan to achieve sustainable growth and restructure the organisation to ensure TLI's corporate governance is in line with the rapidly changing insurance landscape.
TLI also wants to establish and enhance its brand awareness on the international stage, said Mr Chai.
He said public fundraising will also help strengthen the company's business development and expansion plan to maintain a leading position in the life insurance industry in Thailand and Southeast Asia.
The proceeds will be used to create strong and sustainable growth through investment in digital technology and the expansion of distribution channels and businesses, said Mr Chai.
""The company's financial condition remains strong with a capital adequacy ratio of 334% as of June 30, significantly higher than the rate required by the Office of the Insurance Commission at 120%,"" he said.
""The company also has shareholders' equity of 82.14 billion baht, which is the third-largest in the Thai life insurance business.""
During 2018-2020, the company recorded total revenue of 101 billion baht, 108 billion and 108 billion respectively, with net profits of 6.71 billion baht, 6.78 billion and 7.69 billion.
TLI recorded a cumulative average annual growth rate of 7.1% during the period.
As of March 31 this year, TLI had total assets of 535 billion baht, total revenues of 25.95 billion baht and net profits of 3.79 billion baht, with total insurance premiums received of 19.5 billion baht.
As of December 2021, the company had 4.47 million total policies and a fundamental value of 142 billion baht, said Mr Chai.
While many businesses, especially those in the non-life businesses, have been affected by the Covid epidemic, TLI has maintained a healthy financial position because the amount of health claims were consistent before and after the pandemic, he said.
The company also has a high level of capital reserves at 345 billion baht, which is sufficient for claim payments.
Mr Chai said TLI's vision is to become a sustainable life insurance company that caters to all life and personal finance plans by developing products and services to meet the needs of customers at every life stage and lifestyle.
BUILDING CHANNELS
The company has various distribution channels, with agents as the main distributors. There are more than 66,000 life insurance agents available nationwide, creating a vast network that helps the company offer both basic life insurance products as well as sophisticated and more profitable products. TLI also has customer service centres at 270 branches nationwide.
In addition to agents, TLI is developing various distribution channels such as telephone sales and e-commerce, as well as building business alliances to sell products and provide services to customers through commercial banks, state banks, government organisations, leasing and hire-purchase companies, and consumer finance firms in which the company enters into both exclusive and non-exclusive distribution agreements.
These alliances allow TLI flexibility to choose the best partner in each area and support the value of the company in the long term, he said.
The company currently partners with four commercial banks with a network of more than 750 branches nationwide and is affiliated with banks and five other government organisations with a network of more than 1,500 branches across the country.
According to the ""Thailand Life Insurance"" business report released by Milliman Ltd, an independent actuarial consultancy, the industry has grown exponentially over the past decade.
The industry recorded a compound annual growth rate of 7.3%, the second-largest in Southeast Asia, with the third-highest penetration rate in the region.
In 2020, the penetration rate for life insurance in Thailand was still low, accounting for 3.8% of the nation's GDP, allowing ample space for the industry to grow based on supporting factors such as an increase of the elderly population, a growing need for adequate health coverage and life insurance, and increasing demand for retirement planning and general savings, according to the report.

 STRONG GROWTH PROSPECTS
Finansia Syrus Securities (FSS) said considering the company's total insurance premiums received this year, TLI has a relatively strong chance of recovery in 2022 by taking advantage of the interest rate hike and raised health awareness. The brokerage said TLI should focus on increasing consumer protection and products with higher profit margins.
FSS said the insurance firm adjusted its strategy to improve yield by focusing on the outcome of products, resulting in much higher earnings reports. The brokerage expects TLI's 2022 earnings to increase by 16.8% from the same period last year and to record annual growth of 2.9% for total insurance premiums and 15.8% cumulative average annual growth rate during 2022-2024.
FSS said the company has a strong distribution network based on insurance agents and a comprehensive product range that meets customers' needs.
TLI is one of only two life insurance companies in Thailand with a strong agent base that can offer more sophisticated products, said the brokerage. It also has effective asset and liability management that helps protect the company from interest rate volatility. TLI's return on interest rates is above the industry average, making it less likely to face liquidity problems amidst lower interest rates. "
Thai Life Insurance seeks to raise B37bn in July IPO,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2334798/thai-life-insurance-seeks-to-raise-b37bn-in-july-ipo,27 Jun 2022,2022-07-21 12:24:24.665319,"Thai Life Insurance Plc  (TLI) said on Monday it was seeking to raise up to 37 billion baht in an initial public offering (IPO) next month, pricing shares at 16 baht each in what could be the region's largest IPO this year.It aims to raise 34.4 billion baht for its first time share sale and up to 37 billion baht if an overallotment option is exercised, TLI said in a filing.
The IPO would be the largest equity capital market deal in Southeast Asia in 2022, according to Refinitiv data, with just $2.38 billion worth of IPOs in the region so far compared to $6.1 billion at the same stage last year.
Globally, IPO volumes have dropped 65.4% in the first half as investors remain wary of buying into new deals amid financial market volatility from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, inflation and interest rate rises in developed markets.
Thai Life is offering 2.1 billion shares, about 18.8% of total shares and a greenshoe option of 161.3 million shares.
TLI has a total premiums market share of 12.9% in the three months ending in March. It booked net profits of 3.8 billion baht in the first quarter and has a dividend policy of at least 30% of net profits.

NUR-SULTAN – As part of the 2019 Astana Finance Days, the Astana International Financial Centre’s (AIFC) Bureau for Continuing Professional Development (BCPD) organised Getting Trained for IPO (Initial Public Offering) seminars July 1 for Kazakh companies which are considering entering international capital markets and attracting foreign investments. The meetings involved approximately 50 companies.

“Within the first half of this year, we have been working very closely with investment projects, enterprises and firms. We asked them what kind of needs they have. They all need investments to expand their capacity… From the other side, we were on board with a few large institutional investors to the AIFC… It’s good – we have investors who want to invest and projects that need them. But in this half year, we realised that there is a gap in projects’ investability – what the projects are and what investors want,” AIFC Deputy Board Chair Yernur Rysmagambetov told The Astana Times.
L-R: Vikas Aggarwal and Yernur Rysmagambetov. Photo credit: astanafinancedays.org.
To close the gap, the AIFC team developed a series of workshops for companies willing to venture into the international market, attract foreign investments and launch an IPO.
“We decided to take a proactive approach and initiate a series of workshops and trainings to educate these projects’ holders and companies on what kind of things they need to have to make their companies investable, to attract foreign investors and, the grand goal, to do an IPO,” he added.
To help companies reach their goals, AIFC promotes the idea of educating their staffs to meet international standards and properly and professionally execute all stages of IPO preparation.
“Doing an IPO is hard, but actually being a public company is even harder, because you need to react faster and have an internationally certified staff. Once you have engaged in any performance of investment agreement as a foreign investor, you have certain liabilities. We felt like most of the companies in Central Asia and Kazakhstan are not ready… to be in such environment,” he said.
In the last two years, BCPD has created professional development programmes for accountants, financial analysts, investment managers and risk managers and in human resources, corporate governance and English common law. The organisation is now planning to gather the courses into a single training, the first step of which is Getting Trained for IPO. The next step is to select companies which will continue working with AIFC in September, further educating their staff and expanding their capacity.
“What we are trying to do right now is combine all these programmes into one single large programme which we call Getting Trained for IPO… and work with the companies which are seriously willing to attract foreign investors, want to teach their staff first and upgrade their company… If you are thinking about going international, we are promoting the idea of investing in your own staff and capacity and then going to international markets,” said Rysmagambetov.
Leading experts in key competence areas with international certifications in investment management, risk management, accounting and auditing and personnel management attended the event. The speakers examined practical aspects such as corporate governance, legal support and building relations with investors before, during and after the IPO.

Akshu Campbell-Holt, AIFC Authority senior adviser, spoke about corporate management in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. She noted “the key factors surviving it are environment, social and governance (ESG) investments” that outperformed “traditional investments” in the last several years.
“Companies that have integrated robust ESG practices have displayed lower cost of capital, lower volatility and even fewer instances of bribery, fraud and corruption. These are what we’d like to see as stakeholders of a company,” she said.
“I believe that sustainability is a strong contender to become a new norm in making investment decisions in general,” she added.

Alexander Van de Putte, AIFC Academic Council chair and Governor’s Council Chief Strategy Officer, moderated the workshop. He talked about the importance of diversity in company structure, particularly in gender, age, ethnicity and most importantly mindset that directly influence decision making in the company. He also showed a timetable presenting the method of implementing corporate governance in pre-IPO companies.
In the first half of the training, participants learned about the audit and governance needs of small and medium businesses from Vikas Aggarwal, Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) regional head of Policy for Emerging Markets; investor relations from AIFC chief private banking officer Heiner Hartwich; human resources, particularly long term motivation strategies of top managers during IPO preparation, from Korn Ferry senior consultant Irina Chernozubova, and IPO regulations, particularly preparing a prospectus for investors to familiarise themselves with companies where they want to invest, from Semion Issyk, a lawyer with Zan Hub.

Two Major Kazakh National Companies to Undergo IPO This Year,https://astanatimes.com/2022/02/two-major-kazakh-national-companies-to-undergo-ipo-this-year/,16 February 2022,2022-07-21 12:23:58.547922,"
NUR-SULTAN – Kazakhstan’s national airline Air Astana and the KazMunayGas (KMG) oil and gas company, whose major shareholder is the Samruk Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund, will go public this year, said Yernar Zhanadil, Samruk Kazyna Managing Director for Privatization and Development, in an interview with the Deputy Chair of Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE)  – Andrey Tsaluk on Instagram live.

The listing of both companies was planned several years ago and has been delayed since then due to external factors, said Zhanadil. Speaking about Air Astana, he said that the “COVID-19 pandemic strongly affected the market of air travel.” 
“As the market declined, we decided to wait, especially because airlines had to urgently address their anti-crisis plan,” he said. 
Many airlines either went bankrupt or received a subsidy from the governments during the pandemic, according to Zhanadil. He said that Air Astana did not receive any financial support and yet it was able to overcome the crisis. The company shows good results, mainly due to the high demand for its low-cost airline – Fly Arystan.
Regarding KMG, Zhanadil said that Samruk Kazyna previously decided to postpone the IPO due to the drop in oil prices in March 2020. Despite all the preparations made for a successful listing, “it made no sense at that time to launch an IPO,” he said.
Air Astana and KMG will undergo public listing both at the local stock market and in one of the international exchanges. The major reasons why the two companies will list abroad are ensuring the right market price for the stock and liquidity. Kazakhstan’s local stock market does not have a sufficient volume of trading and needs to catch up with international markets. Another reason is that many international companies have their own regulations that might not satisfy the local ones.
“Taking into account the large size of the companies it is necessary to consider their commercial interests… Exclusive placement on the local markets could lead to the lower selling price of shares, even when there is a significant demand from international investors, who could offer a price that is higher than ours,” said Zhanadil.
The IPO of national companies will be accessible to the public and at least 20 percent of shares will be listed at KASE or/and AIX (Astana International Exchange). 
Tsaluk also asked about plans for the implementation of the privatization plan that was approved for 2021-2025. Zhanadil said that the government privatization plan includes 25 assets of the fund, eight of them large companies and 17 smaller assets. Each of those companies has multiple subsidiaries, which makes around 180 companies eligible for privatization.
Among the large companies, Zhanadil mentioned the KazPost national post company, Samruk Energy, and the Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ) national railway company.
Investors in the energy sector are focused on the principle of environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy investment. Samruk Energy has the facilities to generate more than six gigawatts of electricity, but most of it is generated from coal. Therefore, the company needs to increase its green assets portfolio to be in demand at the IPO, said Zhanadil, adding that they plan an IPO in 2023-2024.
KazPost was supposed to be privatized through a direct targeted sale to a strategic investor back in 2021. “We did work through an open two-stage tender, but unfortunately the price offered did not satisfy the fund. As a result, we came up with a proposal to the government to postpone the sale for two more years. During that time, we will begin strategic initiatives to improve the company’s operating activities, so that it would increase the value of the company,” said Zhanadil.
As for KTZ, Zhanadil said that the company has to resolve the issues related to its large infrastructure assets, large debt burden, and the issue of tariff setting before applying for a listing. It will not be ready for IPO by 2023, he added.

Expert consults citizens on IPO investments as privatisation advances,https://astanatimes.com/2017/02/expert-consults-citizens-on-ipo-investments-as-privatisation-advances/,22 February 2017,2022-07-21 12:23:59.208535,"
ASTANA – Forex Club information and analysis centre head Nikolai Ivchenko has advised citizens to invest funds intelligently when purchasing national companies’ shares at initial public offerings (IPOs), specifically, not to spend all their money on one particular company no matter how stable they are.
Photo credit: inform.kz
“It is hard to talk about issuers; we need to analyse each company individually. Typically, an IPO is not a simple process. Commonly, after the start of an IPO a company’s shares fall in price; however, they start recovering later. Therefore, individuals are recommended not to invest all their money in one or two companies. One can invest 20 percent of the savings in an IPO. Of course, if one sees any segment in the stock market as one of the areas for investment, it is better to spend 10 percent of the savings for an IPO and divide five percent of the investment on each company. The rest of the money can be invested in a long-trading company by buying an index or a basket consisting of 15-20 companies which are included in the index. It is always easier to deal with a reliable asset that has long been trading in the market,” he said, according to inform.kz.
Ivchenko reiterated any IPO carries risks of a sharp rise or decline.
“In general, I can say that the Kazakhstan Stock Market (KASE) will witness positive dynamics in the next two years,” he added.
In a recent address to the nation, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev outlined aspects of further stock market development. He noted the necessity of expanding opportunities for people to invest their savings primarily in various types of stocks. The President instructed the government together with the National Bank to take adequate measures aimed at enhancing the domestic stock market.
The Samruk Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund intends to transfer 23 assets to the competitive environment through IPO this year, said Samruk Kazyna head Umirzak Shukeyev.
“According to our plan for this year, 23 facilities out of 45 in the first list will be sold until the end of 2017,” he added.
From this list, 12 assets will be prepared for IPO in the first half of the year. The world’s largest companies will be invited to participate in the privatisation plan.
“We plan to prepare Air Astana and Kazatomprom for IPO this year,” said Shukeyev.
Prime Minister Bakhytzhan Sagintayev recently instructed the Ministry of Finance to accelerate and complete privatising enterprises.
“The government is supposed to complete the corresponding work before the end of 2018. The Ministry of National Economy is required to submit the government’s draft decision on the approval of a specific list of projects subject to privatisation until 2018,” he added.

"Top Kazakh Companies to Be Privatised through IPO in 2017, 2018",https://astanatimes.com/2016/12/top-kazakh-companies-to-be-privatised-through-ipo-in-2017-2018/,7 December 2016,2022-07-21 12:24:00.020546,"
ASTANA – A Kazakh government commission has approved the Samruk Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund’s plan to privatise major Kazakh national companies through initial public offerings (IPOs) beginning this year, head of Samruk Kazyna Umirzak Shukeyev announced Dec. 6.

“Air Astana plans an IPO in late 2017 or early 2018, depending on market conditions. The deal is already agreed with the second shareholder. As a result, the fund will own only blocking minority ownership, which is equal to 25 percent plus 1 share of voting shares. At that, 51 percent of shares must remain in the hands of Kazakh investors under the intergovernmental agreement,” Shukeyev said.
According to him, Kazakhtelecom is already 49 percent privately owned company. It is planned to prepare it for IPO at the end of 2018. A quarter of Kazatomprom shares will be sold in the first half of 2018 and a quarter of KazMunayGas shares will be sold by the end of 2018. An IPO of Samruk-Energo is planned for 2019.
“Up to 49 percent of Kazpost shares will be sold in 2019. Kazakhstan Temir Zholy will be sold only after its financial recovery in 2020,” the head of Samruk Kazyna said.
Shukeyev reported that Samruk Kazyna is also preparing Qazaq Air and Tauken-Samruk for IPO.
The head of the fund asked the Ministry of National Economy to create a working group to prepare all assets for IPO.
All approaches were approved Nov. 1 by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, said Minister of National Economy Kuandyk Bishimbayev.
“As of today, corresponding decisions were made for 153 companies of 216 companies of Samruk Kazyna and they will be transferred to the competitive environment,” the minister said.
Those include 20 companies among the top 65 major Kazakh companies and 133 second-tier companies.
Bishimbayev said the companies will be listed not only at the Astana International Financial Centre, but also on exchanges in London and Hong Kong.

KEGOC is part of the Samruk Kazyna National Welfare Fund. The move follows the first successful IPO offering issued by KazTransOil (KTO), the country’s largest oil pipeline company, late last year.
Later this year, KazTransGas (KTG) and Samruk Energo will also issue their IPO shares offerings, the press conference was told. 
Deputy Prime-Minister Kairat Kelimbetov told the press conference that the first round of the People’s IPO Programme had been a success. The value of the new shares had increased and boosted the value of KazTransOil (KTO) in 2012. The company reported a net profit of 33.5 billion tenge ($220 million) in 2012, a 29.1 percent increase on 2011. 
“Since offering shares in November-December 2012, the share price has increased by 10-14 percent,” Kelimbetov said. “The demand for KTO’s shares was oversubscribed by more than two-fold, after they were issued at a price 725 tenge ($4.80) per share. Since trading started, the share price has risen to 800 ($5.30) to 830 tenge ($5.50).”
“KazTransOil will distribute dividends for 2012 and direct more than 40 percent of its net profit into its shareholders’ dividends. The shareholders will receive returns on their investments and invaluable experience of co-ownership of the largest national assets,” Kelimbetov said. 
The amount of the dividends will be announced in May after the Annual General Meeting of KTO shareholders. 
Bank CenterCredit (BCC) investment analysts say the results of KTO exceeded expectations. They predict the minimum commission rate will be 38 tenge (25 U.S. cents) per share, 5.2 percent of the offering price or 4.6 percent of the current market price.
Halyk Finance has revised its forecasts for KTO shares and projects that their value will continue to rise. Experts say the cost of oil transportation services in 2012 grew only by 4.2 percent – to 2,103 tenge/1,000 kilometres ($13.94 for 600 miles), which is below the inflation rate for the year and the recent rate of cost growth (8,6 percent in 2010, 13.1 percent in 2011). 
“We have revised our valuation model, reducing growth forecast costs, and as a result we have increased our estimates of the fair shares value to 854 tenge $5.66) and raised our 12-month target price to 912 tenge ($6.04) per share and recommend buying shares of KTO,” a Halyk Finance analyst said. 
The Asyl-Invest Company recommends purchasing KTO shares as a protective hedge against the expected strong correction in global financial markets. Experts believe there are three factors that can boost the value of KTO shares: the possible transit of 7 million tons of Russian oil per year through KTO’s pipelines in Kazakhstan to China, possible additional payments from the Russian company Transneft to KTO worth $65 million for oil, and the new tariff for oil transportation at the Kasymov oil station which was approved on February 11. 
KazTransOil’s own management projects significant revenue growth in 2013 that will make the company’s securities more attractive to investors. 
“I can definitely say profits will be higher in 2013, because the tariff for oil transportation was raised on Dec. 1, 2012 for both the domestic and foreign markets. The company’s profit will rise significantly, 30 percent in 2013 above that of 2012,” KazTransOil Director General Kairgeldy Kabyldin told the press conference. 
KazTransOil issued 38,463,559 shares (just under 10 percent of its total shares) on the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) in 2012 and they were bought by 34,000 private investors and 10 pension funds. In Almaty, 4,200 people bought 48.06 percent of the entire IPO issue, in Astana, 2,500 bought 14.35 percent, in Aktobe, 4,785 bought shares, in Atyrau, 4,595, and in Mangistau, 4,614.
Samruk Kazyna announced the basic documents for the KEGOC IPO issue have already been prepared. KEGOC currently has 10,767,297 shares in circulation at a nominal value of 10,000 tenge ($66.27) each. The company’s registered capital is 106.8 billion tenge ($710 million). Its revenues came to 71.674 billion tenge ($475 million) and its net profits came to 6.941 billion tenge ($46.3 million).
New oil tariffs will increase the profitability of the company over the next three years.
Independent Kazakh and foreign consultants have worked on preparing the new IPO issue including Halyk Finance as financial consultants, Citigroup Global Markets as international financial consultants, Dechert as legal advisors, Fichtner as technology consultants, Deloitte as a consultant firm to review financial reporting procedures, Due Diligence and DF King WorldWide (Europe)/APEX Consult. 
Until 2006, KEGOC was a 100 percent state-owned company. In 2006, all of the state stock was transferred to the Samruk Kazakhstan Holding for Management of State Assets as payment for the placed shares. In 2008, the merger of Kazyna Sustainable Development Fund and Samruk Kazakhstan Holding for Management of State Assets created the Samruk-Kazyna National Welfare Fund which now owns all KEGOC’s shares.
KEGOC’s main goal is to maintain the steady operation of the country’s unified energy system and to exercise reliable control of the National Power Grid maintaining engineering, economic and ecological requirements set up by the government. It aims to establish world class operating standards and to become Central Asia’s most advanced utilities provider by 2025. 
KEGOC) received a GAMMA-5 (Governance Accountability, Management, Metrics and Analysis) rating from Standard & Poor’s Corporate Governance Rating Service on March 15, 2010.
On Dec. 22, 2010, Fitch Ratings confirmed KEGOC long-term foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at BBB and upgraded the company’s prospects from stable to positive. Its short-term foreign currency IDR was confirmed at F3. 
On April 20, 2011 Moody’s Investors Service confirmed KEGOC’s senior unsecured debt rating at Baa3 and upgraded its rating from negative to stable. This change reflected KEGOC’s strengthened financial profile in 2010 generated by the national economic recovery, supportive new tariff regulations and a limited reduction of investments compared to 2009. 
Experts believe KEGOC’s ratings continue to be aligned with the sovereign ratings given the state guarantees for 56 percent of its debt. KEGOC is under full state control and enjoys strong government support.
KEGOC, as a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna, serves as the system operator of Kazakhstan’s single power grid. It operates 24,500 kilometres (15,223 miles) of power lines with a capacity of 110-1150 kV and 74 power stations with an installed capacity of transformers of 33.6 GVA.
An Initial Public Offering or IPO is the first public offering by a company of its shares for sale. The People’s IPO programme allows Kazakhstan citizens to buy shares in the largest national companies to share in their profits. The companies issuing the People’s IPO shares were selected from the most stable corporations in the country operated by the Samruk-Kazyna National Welfare Fund. Ownership of shares in successful companies will give citizens the opportunity to profit from their development and growth through rises in share values and through the payment of dividends. 
Experts believe the programme will help the development of Kazakhstan as a regional financial centre in Central Asia.

“In 2019, we plan to list two Samruk Kazyna [Sovereign Wealth Fund] companies through IPOs. These are Kazakhtelecom and Air Astana. In 2020, the plan will include Kazakhstan Temir Zholy [national railway company], KazMunayGas, KazPost and Samruk Energo. In each case, Samruk Kazyna will make the decision at the board of the fund on implementation of shares through IPO. The website will list all information concerning the sales,” he noted.
This year, the ministry plans to sell another 123 facilities as part of its large-scale privatisation effort; 22 large companies under Samruk Kazyna will remain for 2020.
The privatisation programme launched in 2016 is currently 84 percent complete, said Smailov. Of the 898 objects on the list, 530 are for sale, including 473 sold for 470 billion tenge (US$1.25 billion).
The figure is 1.7 percent higher than the estimated market price and 51 percent higher than their book value, he added. This includes 47 national objects worth 44 billion tenge (US$117.2 million), 246 communal property objects worth 64 billion tenge (US$170.5 million), 102 objects owned by national holdings worth 356 billion tenge (US$948.8 million) and 78 corporate social entrepreneurship objects worth six billion tenge (US$15.9 million).
Another 280 facilities are at the reorganisation and liquidation stage.
Kazatomprom, the national atomic company, placed 15 percent of its shares ($431 million) on the London Stock Exchange and Astana International Exchange in November. It was the first national company listed on an international stock exchange and shares were purchased by 49 foreign and 17 local companies and 2,700 Kazakh citizens.
“I would like to note that the comprehensive privatisation plan is regularly updated with the facilities revealed during the inventory. Last year, an additional 48 objects were included in the list,” said Smailov.
“There are no limits for taking part in an IPO. All citizens have the right to participate in an IPO. This entitles [the individual] to revenues of the company that lists its shares on the exchange and receive part of it through dividends on one side and, on the other, if company shares grow, then through this [mechanism],” he added.

ASTANA – The Kazatomprom national atomic company, one of the world’s largest uranium producers, placed 15 percent of its shares worth of $451 million Nov. 13 on the London Stock Exchange. It became the first Kazakh national company on an international stock exchange.

The company approved the final price range prospectus at $11.60 per GDR and 4,322.74 tenge per common share Oct. 13. The demand for shares exceeded supply by a factor of 1.7. Kazakh investors acquired 47.5 percent of the total shares.
Kazatomprom said in a statement that it will finalise all the dealings with global depositary receipts (GDRs) within initial public offerings’ (IPO) by Nov. 20.
The company first announced Oct. 22 about its plans to list its 25 percent equity to an initial public offering globally at the London Stock Exchange and to domestic investors at the Astana International Exchange (AIX), the Astana International Financial Centre’s international stock exchange.
“We see significant potential for Kazatomprom. Our leading market position, combined with a strong management team, the highest standards of governance and a market-centric strategy, puts us in a strong position to capitalise on the attractive long-term fundamentals of the uranium market. We look forward to sharing our story with prospective investors over the coming weeks,” said Kazatomprom Chairman Galymzhan Pirmatov.
The Kazatomprom’s IPO is part of an effort by Kazakhstan to achieve large-scale privatisation to make the domestic economy more efficient and competitive.
For years, the Samruk Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund has been the sole shareholder of the company. Thus, in accordance with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recommendations, the decision to for a partial privatisation was made as a measure to reduce the state’s share in economy.
“It’s hugely meaningful for the industry… It makes the industry more transparent,” said Rob Crayfourd, a portfolio manager for uranium-focused fund Geiger Counter Ltd as quoted by bloombergquint.com.
Kazatomprom issued Oct. 31 a prospectus, roughly a 700-page long document, reporting insights into its activity.
“We have been encouraged by the initial response to our proposed IPO from prospective institutional investors around the world. Kazatomprom offers investors a unique opportunity to participate in a true global leader: the world’s leading uranium producer, with the largest reserves and lowest quartile operating costs,” said Pirmatov.
Next to follow up on Kazatomprom’s example of privatisation are major companies such as Kazakhtelecom and Air Astana, as well as the biggest company of them all, KazMunayGas,.
According to the current legislation, at least 20 percent of the total shares and GDRs were offered to institutional and retail investors in Kazakhstan. The offerings will be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations of AIX.
The offering and the AIX offering has been set at the price range $11.6-$15.4 per GDR or per share, that can bring an equity value for the company between $3-$4 billion.
Samruk Kazyna secured 38,903,491 Kazatomprom shares in a sale, which is 15 percent of Kazatomprom’s issued share capital for the global offering.
To note, uranium prices have started to recover after years of steep fall because of Fukushima disaster in 2011. Kazatomprom and other atomic companies made a production cut which increased prices by more than 30 percent.
“In recent years we have pursued a much more market-centric strategy, shifting our focus from volume to value,” said Pirmatov as quoted by bloombergquint.com
Credit Suisse and J.P. Morgan are joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners in connection with the offering. China International Capital Corporation, Halyk Finance and Mizuho International are also joint bookrunners. Numis Securities Limited is co-manager.
Halyk Finance, the subsidiary of Halyk Bank of Kazakhstan, is leading the effort at the AIX offering.

Kazakhstan’s KazMunayGas to Undertake IPO This Year,https://astanatimes.com/2022/07/kazakhstans-kazmunaygas-to-undertake-ipo-this-year/,14 July 2022,2022-07-21 12:24:03.624751,"
NUR-SULTAN – KazMunayGas (KMG), a national oil and gas company, will go public in 2022, said Samruk Kazyna Board Chair Almasadam Satkaliyev.

KMG is a key asset of Samruk Kazyna National Wealth Fund, a state-owned sovereign wealth fund that controls most of Kazakhstan’s valuable assets – all worth nearly US$67.4 billion. KMG alone produces 25 percent of the country’s oil and gas condensate and 15 percent of natural gas and associated gas. It also owns a 56 percent share of Kazakhstan’s oil transportation market.
In 2021, KMG produced 21.651 million tons of oil and 8.1 billion cubic meters of associated gas and natural gas. Besides its exploration activities, KMG operates the four largest refineries in Kazakhstan and two in Romania.
The initial public offering (IPO) of KMG shares will take place on the platforms of Astana International Exchange (AIX) and KASE (The Kazakhstan Stock Exchange). The fund and KMG have hired investment banks to prepare the listing.
“The main point of our development strategy is the reduction of the share of Samruk Kazyna in the local economy and the implementation of our comprehensive privatization plan. In February this year, the government approved new criteria for our assets to be included in the list of the privatization program. The philosophy of this criteria is based on the idea to promote an inclusive economy and create competitive markets,” said Satkaliyev at the Astana Finance Days on June 28. He noted KMG’s huge potential in terms of development and the energy transition.
Speaking about other plans for IPO, Satkaliyev said Air Astana is most ready, but considering the current geopolitical situation, conducting Air Astana IPO this year will not be effective.
There is a possibility of QazaqGas national company, which is in charge of natural gas transport via main gas pipelines, international transit, and sale of natural gas on domestic and foreign markets, going public in 2023.
“The company is young and ambitious,” he said. “The company, however, needs to focus on the growth in the resource base and implementation of large infrastructure projects.”
Addressing the Astana International Financial Centre management council meeting on June 2, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev emphasized all citizens should have equal opportunity to buy shares of national companies, including through digital platforms. It is one of the ways to form an investment culture among people.
“To involve the general population, we plan to use Kazpost’s [national post company] digital infrastructure, exchanges and brokers. For example, it will be possible to buy shares without leaving home, using mobile applications, and for remote regions – to use the services of Kazpost offices,” said Satkaliyev.
KMG is among 25 companies from Samruk Kazyna included in the nation’s privatization plan for 2021-2025. Overall, the plan, which is 35 percent complete as of 2021, includes 721 state-owned enterprises.
Privatization has been a long effort for Kazakhstan. Its large-scale privatization plan for 2016-2020 was fully implemented. The share of the state’s involvement in the economy went down from 19 percent in 2015 to 14.6 percent in 2021.
In November 2018, Kazatomprom, the world’s leading uranium producer and one of the Samruk Kazyna assets, placed 15 percent of its shares worth $451 million on the London Stock Exchange and AIX becoming the first national company listed on an international stock exchange. Back then, its shares were purchased by 49 foreign and 17 local companies and 2,700 Kazakh citizens.

NUR-SULTAN – Samruk Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund developed a privatisation programme to launch the initial public offerings (IPOs) of Kazakhstan’s major national companies and engage foreign investors, said its Assets Management Managing Director Almasadam Satkaliyev May 17 at the 2019 Kazakhstan Global Investment Roundtable (KGIR).

Kazatomprom, the world’s largest uranium producer, placed 15 percent of its shares worth $431 million on the London Stock Exchange and Astana International Exchange in November. It was the first national company listed on an international stock exchange, and its shares were purchased by 49 foreign and 17 local companies and 2,700 Kazakh citizens.
Kazakhtelecom and Air Astana are expected to go public this year, giving momentum to the government’s privatisation programme.
“All IPO cases are different, each with a different strategy and approach,” said Satkaliyev at the roundtable on Kazakhstan’s Privatisation Drive: Building a Capital Market Through the IPO of State-Owned Champions. “Kazakhtelecom is the leading telecommunications operator in our country, accounting for 61 percent of mobile network communication. Its shares will be listed at the Astana International Exchange this year, and we are almost at the final stage. We anticipate a strong interest from the investor community because they like the company’s history.”
Stock market launches of Kazakhstan Temir Zholy, KazPost, KazMunayGas, Qazaq Air, Samruk Energo and Tau-Ken Samruk were initially planned for 2020.
“Tau-Ken Samruk is a promising national mining company that deals with solid minerals. Currently, the company operates eight projects in metals, such as zinc, copper, gold and silver. All of them are at different stages of development. We believe that we need a special programme for this company and need to attract international investment institutions and banks as investors,” he said.
Kazakhstan Temir Zholy, Kazpost and Qazaq Air, in particular, will undergo thorough preparation before launching their IPOs.
“We are working on the financial stability of the companies and understand that they should pass this stage in two to three years time and, only then, can go public,” noted Satkaliyev. “We enlisted KPMG as an independent expert (for Kazpost), and they advised that we list a certain number of its shares. Kazpost’s current operating conditions require subsidies from the government for things such as a local postal service. We believe that all these companies are very promising, especially Kazpost because it has a very interesting logistics project.”
The third annual KGIR, headlined by Kazakh Prime Minister Askar Mamin, convened more than 1,100 business executives, influential policymakers and international experts from 41 countries to promote Kazakhstan’s investment potential and introduce new technologies and global best practices for local implementation.

ADX has experienced a 25% year-to-date increase in market capitalization to close to AED 2 trillion (USD 545 billion), bolstered by a series of IPOs and listings over the past year – which have totalled over USD 5 billion – including Abu Dhabi Ports, Fertiglobe, ADNOC Drilling, Alpha Dhabi and Multiply Group. Additionally, in the last week, Borouge raised USD 2 billion in an IPO and successfully listed on ADX, marking one of the largest IPOs on ADX to date.
Saeed Hamad Al Dhaheri, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of ADX, said: “UAE capital markets are shining brightly on the screens of international institutional investors due to the country’s robust macroeconomic fundamentals, strong corporate performance and accelerating capital markets activity. ADX is a core component of the major transformation underway in the region, which is creating a vibrant, diversified and sustainable economy. Access to long-term global capital is central to this ambition, and it is therefore important that we continue to nurture relationships and informational flows with international investors.”  
The senior ADX delegation, led by Managing Director and CEO Saeed Hamad Al Dhaheri, includes over 25 CEOs, CFOs and senior executives from the following listed companies: ADNOC Distribution, ADNOC Drilling, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB), Agthia, Aldar Properties, Al Yah Satellite Communications Company (Yahsat), Emirates Telecommunication Group Company (Etisalat), First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) and Fertiglobe.

Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) has successfully completed a London investor roadshow which saw ADX host a delegation of over 25 senior executives from 9 listed companies and the exchange. The sizeable Abu Dhabi capital market representation reinforces the strong focus on investor relations and continuous dialogue that ADX and its listed companies continue to foster with international and institutional investors.
Over the course of the two-day event, ADX’s delegation hosted 204 investor meetings across 47 one-on-one meetings and 37 group meetings, meeting a total of 89 institutional investors including some of the world’s largest asset management firms in attendance, who collectively manage an aggregate of over $4 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM).
This integral roadshow comes amidst a backdrop of significant and sustained activity on ADX which has seen increasingly growing demand and interest across its capital markets from international and institutional investors – including on IPOs, listings and new product launches. This stream of activity has led to ADX recently surpassing AED 2 trillion market capitalization target milestone to become the second largest exchange in the Middle East.
The ADX delegation highlighted the growing interest among institutional investors and were able to convey Abu Dhabi’s track record of growth, backed by robust market fundamentals that continue to position the emirate and its capital markets as vibrant, active, and resilient. 
ADX was also able to demonstrate its ability to sustain its strong growth trajectory and the various strategic levers that are being activated as part of its strategy. These levers focus on increasing liquidity, trading activity, market capitalization, sector diversification, while also remaining focused on digital transformation, the investor journey and introducing innovative products and services as part of its ‘ADX One’ strategy.
Saeed Hamad Al Dhaheri, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of ADX, said: “The well-attended roadshow and size of the ADX delegation is a clear example of the deep and growing international and institutional investor confidence in both Abu Dhabi as a premier investment destination and ADX as the hub for regional participation of institutional and international capital. This is evident through the robust demand our recent IPO pipeline and listings have continued to attract. By building on ADX’s strong market performance and the strategic achievements garnered over the last year, Abu Dhabi and its capital market ecosystem continues to be strongly poised and positioned for a sustained period of growth as we continue to diversify and scale our product, service and sector offering.”   
The roadshow also enabled ADX’s listed companies to showcase their equity stories, and solid financial performance as part of this burgeoning backdrop while also outlining their recent achievements, growth drivers going forward, and investor relations focus as part of a wider drive to increase international participation and investment in ADX equity capital markets. 
Abdulfattah Sharaf, CEO of HSBC UAE and Head of International Middle East, commented: “The UAE economy is a hub of market activity across the Middle East, as evidenced by the past year’s boom in IPO listings across the country. Despite ongoing global challenges, the UAE economy has been resilient and that is reflected in surging demand from investors, seeking access to this rapidly-emerging market. We are excited to connect our global investors to the opportunities in the UAE and that is why we’ve convened this event.”
ADX’s recent initiatives to foster and attract international investors continue to bear fruit with institutional investors trading values (buy + sell) increasing by 83% from AED 93 billion in Q1 2021 to reach AED 170 billion in Q1 2022, while net foreign investment stood at AED 8.3 billion.  Moreover, the market value of shares owned by foreign investors from AED 50 billion in Q1 2021 to AED 131 billion during Q1 2022, an increase of around 163% with the top 25 asset and fund managers in the world in terms of AUM currently invested in ADX-listed companies. 
The senior ADX delegation was led by Managing Director and CEO Saeed Hamad Al Dhaheri and included over 25 senior executives from the following listed companies: ADNOC Distribution, ADNOC Drilling, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB), Agthia, Aldar Properties, Al Yah Satellite Communications Company (Yahsat), Emirates Telecommunication Group Company (Etisalat), First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) and Fertiglobe.

Ahmed El-Hoshy, Group CEO of Fertiglobe, said: “Fertiglobe is honoured to be invited by the ADX to join the Investor Conference in London this year. We are proud to be listed on the ADX and extend our congratulations to the exchange for reaching over AED 2 trillion in market capitalisation. The exchange has provided us with an excellent platform as we continue to grow our business and raise our investor profile on a global scale and enabled us to form a key part of Abu Dhabi’s capital markets, in a time when we are witnessing a significant rise in investor appetite and strong interest for companies based in the UAE.”
Ali Al Hashemi, Group CEO of Yahsat, said: “We are delighted to have participated in the ADX London Conference 2022 in collaboration with HSBC, a forum that promoted discussions between ADX listed companies and global investors on the latest investment trends and opportunities in the UAE. Yahsat successfully listed on the ADX in July 2021. It has since continued to deliver a strong financial performance and remains on track to deliver robust growth in 2022 across the business.

Anghami Inc. (“Anghami”) (NASDAQ: ANGH), the leading music and entertainment streaming platform in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), has announced the acquisition of Spotlight Events, an events and concert company specialized in managing and executing live events and concerts in the region.
The partnership will see Spotlight Events become Anghami's arm for live events and concerts, including offline activities and activations to further expand Anghami's footprint in the music and entertainment ecosystem while unlocking synergies and opportunities between the physical and digital worlds.
While Spotlight Events will provide a stage for artists to perform and reach their audiences offline, Anghami's technology will bridge the gap between the offline and online worlds by providing access to exclusive concerts through its live video streaming capabilities and creating immersive experiences through AR and VR. The strategic partnership will enable Anghami to unlock opportunities between artists and brands, enriching music fans' experiences with exclusive access to private concerts, VIP lounges, meet & greets and backstage access, in addition to attending concerts either offline or streamed through their devices. Traditional and virtual concerts will be accessible either through tickets or sponsored by brands.
Eddy Maroun, Co-founder and CEO of Anghami commented: “Our vision is to expand from music streaming to a fully integrated entertainment platform that meets our goal of building our own unique category that no other provider can compete with. This partnership will allow us to deliver unique experiences to our users while giving artists a stage to perform and reach their fans physically and virtually. Spotlight and Anghami Lab are among a number of initiatives we plan to develop as new business extensions to accelerate our growth and improve our margins while widening the gap with our competitors. Maher has built a great business on solid economics and has proven that live concerts and events are a scalable and profitable business.”
Spotlight Events has recently confirmed its program of upcoming concerts and events in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Paris, Cairo and Riyadh, including ""Beat the Heat"", a 7-concert festival organized in collaboration with the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing - Dubai (DTCM). Also in Abu Dhabi, 6 concerts are planned for the rest of the year, to be announced at a later date. Also on the schedule is the much anticipated live concert by the Arab superstar Wael Kfoury in Paris. Spotlight will also be executing all of Anghami's events, including ""Amr Diab Live"" and other major surprises to be unveiled soon.
Maher Khawkhaji, Founder and CEO of Spotlight added: “Anghami is the largest music platform in the MENA region with an incredible number of users and a unique network of partnerships that, once connected to Spotlight, will open doors to amazing opportunities. Our offline expertise, complemented by Anghami's reach, data and technical capabilities, is the perfect recipe for success. We look forward to being part of this dynamic team and unleashing the incredible potential to bring the best to music fans, artists and brands and take entertainment to the next level.”
The announcement follows Anghami's recent IPO on Nasdaq as the first Arab tech company to list on the U.S. stock market and the unveiling of an all-new brand identity to support the next phase of growth for the company, which is evolving from a music streaming platform to an entertainment platform.

ADGM registered Borouge completes listing on Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange in a sign of growing investor demand for UAE companies,https://www.albawaba.com//business/pr/adgm-registered-borouge-completes-listing-abu-dhabi-securities-exchange-sign-growing,"
Published June 3rd, 2022 - 09:15 GMT
",2022-07-21 12:23:54.718087,"
Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) today welcomed the successful initial public offering (IPO) of Borouge plc (Borouge), an ADGM registered public company, on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX). Borouge became the largest ever listing to date in Abu Dhabi’s history, further strengthening the capital’s growing and dynamic capital markets.
Borouge’s listing marks a significant milestone for Abu Dhabi and further strengthens ADGM’s position as the region’s leading International Financial Centre. With its supportive business environment comprising a pioneering regulatory landscape and English common law framework, ADGM is seeing a significant increase in the number of companies choosing to register at the financial centre and explore a potential listing on ADX to attract international investors.
As one of the best performing exchanges globally in 2021, ADX saw the number of new institutional investors increase by 77 per cent to 708 in 2021 and nine companies list last year, including Adnoc Drilling and Fertiglobe, a leading nitrogen fertilizer and ammonia producer and distributer. In 2022, the exchange has continued its listing momentum with Abu Dhabi Ports Group raising $1.1bn from its share sale in February to expand operations globally and boost growth
The latest Borouge offering has seen the highest subscription levels by UAE retail investors in any UAE IPO in almost two decades and significant demand from local and international institutional investors, leading to an oversubscription by 42 times. Of the 10 per cent of total issued shared share capital offered as part of the float, 88 per cent was earmarked for institutional investors, who placed orders of about $65.5 billion.
Commenting on the successful listing, His Excellency Ahmed Jasim Al Zaabi, Chairman of ADGM said: “We congratulate Borouge on this important milestone and the significant interest it has generated the world over. Despite volatile global markets, high investor interest in Borouge demonstrates the untapped potential and value of UAE companies for local and global investors. This is a defining moment for the UAE’s capital and regulatory markets. As Abu Dhabi’s International Financial Centre, we’re seeing a significant increase in companies registering in ADGM and exploring listings in the UAE to capitalise on the strong local and international investor demand for the UAE’s national champions. As a destination of choice that helps businesses thrive, ADGM will continue to support organisations across Abu Dhabi to achieve their ambitions.”
Borouge is now a part of ADGM’s fast-growing community of more than 4700 registered entities, comprising world-class local and international banks, financial institutions, investment firms, fund management companies, treasury centres, energy companies, technology firms, tech start-ups, corporate and professional services, and more.
Established in 1998, Borouge is a strategic joint venture between the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (“ADNOC”) and Borealis. It is one of the world’s leading providers of innovative and differentiated polyolefin solutions for the agriculture, infrastructure, energy, advanced packaging, mobility, and healthcare industries.

Nutraceutical player Sami-Sabinsa to invest ₹300 crore for two new manufacturing facilities
",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/nutraceutical-player-sami-sabinsa-to-invest-300-crore-for-two-new-manufacturing-facilities/article65634597.ece,"Jul 14, 2022",2022-07-21 12:23:49.443396,"Sami-Sabinsa Group Limited, a nutraceutical company, will be building two additional manufacturing units with an investment of ₹300 crore in Hassan, Karnataka, within a year. The company expects to strengthen its position in the Indian and overseas markets with additional production capacities.“Our first facility would be operational within three months; the other is scheduled before we close the FY23. The objective is to enhance our production capacity in the nutritional fine chemicals and herbal extract segments. The two units together have a production capacity of producing 50 tonnes of ingredients per month,” said Muhammed Majeed, Founder and Chairman, Sami-Sabinsa Group.Although the company’s herbal extract product line contributes up to 60 per cent to the overall revenue of ₹1200 crore it clocked in FY22, Majeed believes that the nutritional fine chemical segment is expected to register growth in the coming years. “Going forward, the fine chemicals will take a major leap because we have new capacity coming up now.” Currently, nutritional fine chemicals contribute about 10 per cent to the company’s annual revenue. The other two product lines include probiotics (20 per cent) and cosmeceuticals (10 per cent).While there are no new product launches scheduled for this year, the company has other plans. Majeed said, “There are 300 patents in the pipeline. Every patent is a product and we launch new products every alternate year.” The nutraceutical player has 380 patents on its name. Sami Sabinsa is an export-oriented company with 95 per cent of its business coming from exports. However, the Indian market is essential as it has more volume. “The Indian market is highly price-sensitive, so here the products are priced at just one-sixth of the US price. India offers much bigger volumes,” Majeed added. The company said it expects revenue to increase by at least 20 per cent in the FY23. The company has a headcount of 1200 employees across its six facilities and plans to add 300 people more by end of FY23. Launching its IPOSami-Sabsina is also examining a initial public offering (IPO). “Within two years the company will launch its initial public offering (IPO), post which we would proceed with our acquisition plans,” he added, stating, “in the last 34 years, the company has established itself organically and feels market-based acquisition to be the key to moving forward.”The prospective companies being examined by Sami-Sabinsa for acquisition would be in the areas of manufacturing and marketing with shelf space across the globe. “The money raised from the IPO will go into acquisition and we will look for a company that has a manufacturing and market space in Europe, the US, and Dubai,” said the founder. The Sami-Sabinsa group’s manufacturing facilities are located in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Utah (USA). It has a global footprint with a presence in the US, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, South Africa, South Korea, and several more.

ONE store scraps IPO plan due to weak investor confidence: sources,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/one-store-scraps-ipo-plan-due-to-weak-investor-confidence-sources/,,21-07-2022,"SEOUL-- ONE store Co., a South Korean mobile app market platform, decided Wednesday to withdraw its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) due to lackluster investor confidence, financial industry sources said.

The No. 2 mobile app market operator here, after Google Play store, received lackluster response from institutional investors during a two-day demand forecasting session until Tuesday, according to the sources. Institutional bids reportedly mostly fell below the company's desired pricing band between 34,300 won ($27) and 41,700 won.

""Just this morning, ONE store considered going public by lowering the desired price, but they apparently decided to scrap the plan after concluding the company's value may not be properly recognized by the market under the current stock market situation,"" a source said.

ONE store's affiliate SK shieldus also nixed its IPO plan last week due to weak investor sentiment.

Lee Jae-hwan, CEO of ONE store, said in a press conference on Monday that the company was determined to get listed on the main bourse as planned this month, undeterred by the sister company's derailed attempt.

ONE store is the latest among several South Korean companies that have backpedaled on IPO plans so far this year. In late January, Hyundai Engineering Co., the construction arm of Hyundai Motor Group, withdrew its plan to get its stocks listed on the country's main bourse due to adverse market conditions.

ONE store logged 214 billion won in sales last year and an operating loss of 5.8 billion won. The company racked up 1.13 trillion won worth of transactions on its platform last year.

Its market share in the local mobile app market stands at some 14 percent, with Google Play's presence coming in at 71.9 percent.

SK shieldus eyes raising up to 3.55 tln won through IPO next month,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/sk-shieldus-eyes-raising-up-to-3-55-tln-won-through-ipo-next-month/,,21-07-2022,"SEOUL-- SK shieldus Co., a security arm of South Korean telecom giant SK Telecom Co., is expected to raise up to 3.55 trillion won (US$2.85 billion) through a planned initial public offering (IPO) next month.

The listing, set for May 19, will mark the biggest ever market debut by a security service provider, more than the value of its rival firm S-1 Corp., a security firm under Samsung Group.

""Our company integrated cybersecurity and physical security services. SK shieldus should not be compared with S-1 by one-to-one,"" CEO Park Jin-hyo said at an online conference.

SK shieldus, which changed its name from ADT Caps Co. last October, currently provides security services across four main categories -- cybersecurity, convergence security, physical security, and safety and care.

Last year, the company reported 1.55 trillion won in sales, trailing behind 2.31 trillion won recorded by S-1.

Park said the company aims to take over other security companies with higher technical skills following the IPO, and hire more personnel with expertise in platform.

SK shieldus said it set the IPO price range of 31,000-38,800 won.

Credit Suisse, the lead bookrunner, Morgan Stanley, KB Securities and NH Investment and Securities began taking orders from investors.

Demand forecasting for domestic institutions is slated for May 3 and May 4, with that for retail investors set to take place on May 9 and May 10.

SK On’s IPO unlikely to take place until after 2025: SK Innovation CEO,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/sk-ons-ipo-unlikely-to-take-place-until-after-2025-sk-innovation-ceo/,,21-07-2022,"SEOUL-- SK On Co. is not considering an initial public offering (IPO) for at least another two to three years but will build up its competitiveness and enhance corporate value before pushing for a market debut, head of its parent company said Thursday.

The potential listing of SK On has drawn attention since the battery unit was spun off from SK Innovation in October last year, as part of SK's push to bolster the battery business amid growing demand from global automakers vying for a bigger share in the electric vehicle market.

""What's the most important for an IPO to take place is that we need to have our battery business recognized in the market,"" Kim Jun, CEO and vice chairman of SK Innovation Co., told reporters after a general shareholders meeting.

""I expect that we should be able to deliver the performance, in terms of sales, profitability and stable management of equipment, after 2025, and I believe it would be after 2025 if we were to do an IPO,"" he said.

Its bigger rival, LG Energy Solution Ltd., set a record IPO in January that made the battery maker the second-largest company in South Korea by market cap, reflecting the global electrification trend.

Kim said SK On is at the pre-IPO stage to raise funds from investors in advance of going public.

""We need large-scale resources as we are continuing with the facility expansion ... We plan to sign the contracts (on the investments) in the first half,"" Kim said.

Industry sources predict SK On is seeking to raise between 3 and 5 trillion won (US$2.47-4.12 billion), which amounts to about a 10 percent stake in the company.

Kim forecast SK On will swing to the black in the fourth quarter of this year and achieve an annual surplus from next year. SK Innovation's battery business logged an operating loss of 683.1 billion won in the fourth quarter of last year.

In light of any possible advance into new businesses, Kim said he is looking at areas of ""non-carbon, or low-carbon energy sources,"" and discussing various ideas with SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, without elaborating further.

Earlier this month, Chey hinted at ""drawing up a new business map that incorporates energy and environment"" during a visit to a SK Innovation factory in a southwestern city.

"Money raised through IPOs hits record high in 2021 amid ample liquidity, bullish sentiment",https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/money-raised-through-ipos-hits-record-high-in-2021-amid-ample-liquidity-bullish-sentiment/,,21-07-2022,"SEOUL– The amount of money South Korean firms raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) more than quadrupled to hit a record high last year thanks to ample liquidity and the overall bullish stock market sentiment, data showed Monday.

A total of 89 companies went public in 2021 by listing stocks on the benchmark KOSPI and secondary tech-heavy KOSDAQ markets and raised a combined 19.7 trillion won (US$16.4 billion), according to the data from the Financial Supervisory Service.

The money raised from IPOs represented a 333.9 percent surge from 4.5 trillion won a year earlier, the data showed. The number of companies whose shares listed on the stock markets for the first time also jumped from the previous year’s 70.

The IPO market was driven by the overall rise in local stock markets and ample liquidity injected into the economy bolstered by low borrowing costs in line with record low policy rates intended to boost the pandemic-hit economy.

Investors got more interested in new stock listings, with the competition ratio for IPO stocks jumping to an average of 1,136 to 1 last year, up from the 956-to-1 ratio a year earlier.

The prices of newly listed stocks closed 57.4 percent higher on average on their first trading day, compared with their IPO prices. The return marked the highest in five years, the data showed.

Their average prices also jumped 54.8 percent at the end of last year from the IPO prices. But of the companies that went private, 28 firms, or 31.5 percent, saw their stocks fall below the IPO prices at the end of last year, the data showed.

Existing shareholders will not sell their shares, rather Opdenergy will offer new shares equivalent to a 27.12% share of the company. A so-called greenshoe option gives it the potential to increase this by 10% to 29.83%.

The initial indicated price range valued the company at up to 772 million euros, taking into account 105.9 million existing shares and 39.4 million new shares.

To ascertain a value for the company, investors are looking at Spanish renewable energy companies Solaria (SLRS.MC) and Grenergy Renovables (GREG.MC) as Opdenergy's main peers, a source familiar with the matter said.

Investor sentiment has been boosted by Grenergy Renovables upsizing a capital increase last month to 90 million euros from 80 million, the source said, although the poor performance of shares in recently floated Industrie De Nora is also in the back of investors' mind.

Shares in De Nora (DNR.MI) have traded consistently below their IPO price since the company debuted in Milan on June 30, despite pricing at the bottom of its own IPO price range.

Its shares are down 18% over the past year compared with a 6.3% drop in the benchmark index.The exchange did not offer any comment on its falling share price.It may, however, need to answer to investors, who want to see exchanges worldwide attract new listings to avoid them resembling museums themselves.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterReporting by Isabel Woodford, Editing by Christian Plumb and Nick ZieminskiOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

South Korea steps up to a fearful new world,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2NU04R,"June 17, 2022 12:09am EDT",2022-07-21,"HONG KONG, June 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - South Korea is having a moment. As governments around the world fret about surging commodity prices, fragile economic growth and volatile markets, newly elected President Yoon Suk-yeol is kicking things off on a surprisingly upbeat note. Local companies are bouncing back, with many of them venturing abroad. The confidence should pay off.The headline figures paint a less pretty picture. After expanding by 4.1% in 2021 – an 11-year high – the $1.6 trillion export-dependent economy is forecast to grow just 2.7% this year as demand from China, its top trading partner, cools.  read more  The central bank's new governor in April issued a dire warning that war in Ukraine, a China slowdown, higher U.S. interest rates combined with the country's aging population and decreased productivity might tip the economy into an era of low growth and high inflation known as stagflation. Rising inequality and high household debt are also concerns.The mood in Seoul, however, is notably upbeat. The sprawling metropolis of nearly 10 million people recently scrapped pandemic restrictions such as business curfews and mandatory vaccine passes. Restaurants, bars and coffee shops are packed; last week's friendly soccer match between South Korea and Brazil attracted 64,000 fans to sell out Seoul World Cup Stadium.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterCompared to pre-pandemic times, the capital city feels richer and more vibrant. A recent boom in local stocks, cryptocurrencies and real estate have spurred the city's elite, unable to travel, to flex their wealth at home. Demand for art, imported wine, high-end fashion, cars, and even perfume, is taking off. Luxury sales topped $14 billion in 2021, making South Korea one of the few markets worldwide to surpass 2019 levels, according to Euromonitor.Optimism is evident across Korea Inc too. Covid-19 has been a boon to domestic companies like e-commerce group Coupang and major exporters, including the $350 billion memory-chip maker Samsung Electronics (005930.KS). But during the previous liberal government under Moon Jae-in, firms faced higher corporate taxes, minimum wage increases, cuts to working hours and tougher competition laws. Yoon's pro-business agenda, by contrast, promises deregulation and tax cuts.WESTWARD EXPANSIONThe shift has emboldened the country's powerful family-run conglomerates, or chaebol. Less than a month after Yoon took office, the Samsung group unveiled a bold $356 billion investment plan though 2026, 30% more than in the previous five-year period.  read more  It says it will target semiconductors and biopharmaceuticals, creating over 1 million local jobs in the process.At the same time, U.S.-China tensions have elevated South Korean technology and components in Western supply chains. U.S. President Joe Biden courted chaebol leaders like Samsung's Jay Y. Lee and Euisun Chung of Hyundai Motor Group during his visit last month. The two scions have committed billions of dollars to new semiconductor and electric vehicle factories in the United States. Compatriots like LG Energy Solution (373220.KS), SK On and Posco Chemical (003670.KS) also have struck deals with U.S automakers in electric-vehicle batteries and materials.Beyond manufacturing, once-insular industries are gaining global traction too. K-pop boy band BTS was the world's best-selling act in 2021; drama series ""Squid Game"" smashed viewing records to become Netflix's (NFLX.O) most watched show; Krafton's (259960.KS) ""PUBG Mobile"" retained its spot as one of the world's top grossing games. The international successes have infused companies with confidence to venture out: internet outfits Kakao (035720.KS) and Naver (035420.KS) struck  read more  digital content deals in North America worth a combined $1.6 billion, while CJ ENM (035760.KQ), the company behind Oscar-winner ""Parasite"", recently snapped up an 80% stake in a U.S. studio.In total, outward foreign direct investment in 2021 hit a record high of $76 billion, according to official figures, up by more than a fifth from pre-pandemic levels. More cross-border deals will come. Telecoms-to-energy chaebol SK Group, for example, appointed its first head of U.S. corporate and government affairs as the conglomerate readies a strategic pivot stateside.Such moves should help reduce the country's trade dependence on China. Of course, a more globally integrated and diversified economy also invites fresh risks.Manufacturers like Samsung have long walked a geopolitical tightrope between Beijing and Washington. Yoon's tilt towards America will make it harder to do so. Moreover, given South Korea's rising clout in electric vehicles and semiconductors, tensions with North Korea present supply chain risks. Both sides fired missiles earlier this month amid worries that Pyongyang is readying a nuclear test. There are plenty of reasons these days for governments and investors to be fearful, but that also makes it a good time for an emboldened South Korea and its companies to step up.Follow @mak_robyn on Twitter(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

Eni adds six banks for IPO of $11 billion renewables unit,https://www.energyvoice.com/markets/389001/eni-banks-ipo-renewables/,"21/02/2022, 6:58 am",2022-07-21,"Eni has picked six more banks to work on the initial public offering (IPO) of its retail and renewables unit Plenitude, which could be valued at about 10 billion euros ($11.3 billion), according to people familiar with the matter. The Italian energy giant has hired Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, Equita Group SpA and UniCredit SpA as bookrunners for the Milan IPO, which could kick off as soon as May, the people said. Eni could look to raise as much as 2.3 billion euros from the listing, which would make it one of Europe’s largest this year, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. The IPO is being run by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Mediobanca, the people said. Representatives for Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Eni, Equita, Goldman Sachs, Mediobanca and UniCredit declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported last year that Eni could seek a valuation of as much as 15 billion euros for Plenitude in a listing. IPO candidates have since had to reassess expectations as a darkening geopolitical landscape and increasingly hawkish central banks have piled pressure on equity markets. The poor performance of some of last year’s marquee listings, and the shelving of several recent deals, is also weighing on appetite for IPOs. Eni plans to retain a majority stake in renewables unit Plenitude after the IPO, which comes as energy majors seek to squeeze more value from their renewable portfolios. The listing of Plenitude will help Eni expand the business and give investors better visibility on its value. "
‘Uptick’ in North Sea IPOs forecast with high oil and gas prices on course to continue,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/north-sea/388737/uptick-in-north-sea-ipos-forecast-with-high-oil-and-gas-prices-on-course-to-continue/,"21/02/2022, 12:01 am",2022-07-21,"North Sea initial public offerings (IPOs) could be back on the menu with healthy oil and gas prices tipped to continue for much of 2022. Financial analysts have forecast an “uptick” in North Sea private-equity backed companies looking to go public as investors flock to cash in on high commodity prices. Alex Msimang, energy transaction and project partner at Vinson & Elkins, says that will also be true for other parts of the energy chain “where revenues have a positive correlation with oil and gas prices”, such as oilfield services. Just last month Var Energi ownership partners Eni and HitecVision announced plans for an IPO for the Norwegian operator. And in July, North Sea oil firm Orcadian Energy (LON: ORCA) raised £3 million through its admittance to the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange.  In recent years the decline in the valuation of oil and gas companies, in part due to dreary oil and gas prices, has made IPOs largely unfeasible. There was speculation that it could pave the way for more reverse takeovers, a process – used by Chrysaor in its merger with Premier Oil to create Harbour Energy (LON: HBR) – whereby private companies can go public without an IPO. But with Brent crude futures threatening to top $100 a barrel and high gas prices routinely making international news, the traditional method of going public is back on the cards. Mr Msimang said: “In the medium term I do anticipate an uptick in IPOs in the upstream sector.  The same should be true in other parts of the energy chain where revenues have a positive correlation with oil and gas prices, for example in the oilfield services space, where higher commodity prices mean stronger demand for new wells and the installation of facilities to boost production. “That will not necessarily apply in those parts of the energy chain, like the refinery sector, where oil or gas is a feedstock, such that higher prices are increasing input costs and squeezing margins. “As traditional lenders lose their appetites for oil and gas, companies looking to capture higher commodity prices by spending the money to grow their reserves and their production rates, now need to look for different ways to raise the necessary capital.  At the same time, those higher commodity prices are starting to look tempting to potential energy IPO investors.” While accurately predicting where the next North Sea IPO will come from is tough, there are a number of eligible candidates. Ithaca Energy, a subsidiary of Israel’s Delek Group, said last year that it was exploring options for refinancing, including going public. Similarly there were reports that Neptune Energy, backed by Carlyle Group and CVC Capital Partners, was working with Rothschild to explore a potential IPO. HitecVision’s Neo Energy, Siccar Point Energy and Spirit Energy, which is 69% held by Centrica, could also look to make the move public in the coming years. Head of oil and gas research at Investec Nathan Piper says the banking group is forecasting oil and gas prices to be strong throughout 2022. He said: “The question is will that be enough to see an uptick in investment and exploration. That is unclear at this stage. The other moving part here is private equity companies, and will more of them go public? “All eyes are going to be on Var Energi in Norway and how Harbour Energy continues to perform on the London Stock Exchange. There are also other candidates, whether it is Neo, Ithaca or Neptune – that will be interesting to watch.” There is particular scope for those companies for which gas makes up a significant part of their portfolio to take the IPO plunge. Wholesale UK gas prices have quadrupled in the last year and, as a result, household energy bills will go through the roof from April. Whether you view it as an investor or a consumer, “the signal from the market is that investment in gas production needs to increase in order to boost gas supply,” Mr Msimang said. He added: “Putting all of those trends and drivers together, there should be plenty of scope for high quality, gas-focused upstream corporates to come to market and to grow their businesses.” But despite the improved commodity outlook, there are other factors at play that mean a surge of companies in the “very near-term” is unlikely. Mr Msimang says that market volaitility will make it hard for IPO candidate to know “when and if to push the button”. He said: “Right now the macroeconomic picture is complex for multiple reasons, including spiralling inflation, upwards pressure on interest rates and also less predictability in the dollar exchange rates that are so important for any company generating dollar-denominated oil revenues. “Similarly the political uncertainty around key energy regions, i.e. Russia with its giant gas reserves, makes the landscape less certain.  That all makes it harder for companies to be confident right now in pricing and launching an IPO, or, for that matter, any other capital-raising, financing or M&A transaction.” "
Citigroup among banks leading Aramco refinery unit’s IPO,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/416484/citigroup-among-banks-leading-aramco-refinery-units-ipo/,"01/06/2022, 3:29 pm",2022-07-21,"Citigroup is among the banks leading the planned initial public offering of Saudi Aramco Base Oil, a unit of the state-controlled oil producer, according to people familiar with the matter. Luberef, as the refining company is also known, plans to launch its IPO in the second half of the year, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. The local unit of HSBC Holdings and SNB Capital are also advising on the offering, which could raise about $1 billion. Luberef would join several Aramco subsidiaries already listed on Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange, including chemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries and Rabigh Refining & Petrochemical. Aramco is separately considering selling stakes in its trading business and retail fuels unit, and also mulling a secondary stock offering of its own, Bloomberg News has reported. If these share sales materialize, they could add billions to an already hefty IPO haul in the Middle East. While rampant inflation, tightening monetary policy and Russia’s war in Ukraine have dampened listings activity globally, the Middle East has mostly bucked the trend. High oil prices have been a boon for the region’s energy companies and buoyed local stock markets. Saudi Arabia-based investment firm Jadwa is expected to sell a 30% stake in Luberef in the IPO. The company acquired the holding in 2007 from Exxon Mobil, which originally invested in the development of Luberef’s refinery in 1978. Representatives for Aramco, Citigroup and Jadwa declined to comment, while a spokesperson for Luberef didn’t immediately respond to requests to comment. "
Ashtead Technology forecasting full year revenue increase of 30%,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/north-sea/subsea/380403/ashtead-technology-forecasting-full-year-revenue-increase-of-30/,"18/01/2022, 7:31 am",2022-07-21,"Ashtead Technology is forecasting a buoyant balance sheet after a “strong performance” in 2021. The Aberdeenshire subsea equipment provider benefitted from “improving market conditions” last year in both offshore wind and oil and gas. As a result its full year revenue is expected to be around £55 million, up 30% on 2020 and ahead of previous guidance. The increase was driven by both equipment rental and a higher than anticipated level of new equipment sales in the fourth quarter. Moreover the utilisation of equipment rental has picked up, aided by a recovery in pricing from the impact of Covid. Ashtead’s adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) is expected to be “modestly ahead” of previous guidance, while adjusted EBITA is forecast to be “comfortably ahead”. Allan Pirie, chief executive officer, said: “We are pleased with the full year performance which demonstrates the momentum in our business, delivering on what we set out at our IPO. “We remain confident that Ashtead Technology is ideally positioned to support energy producers’ transition to more renewable sources of energy and benefit from the global investment into offshore wind. “We look forward to continued progress through 2022.” In November Ashtead reached a market valuation of nearly £130m from its initial public offering (IPO). The company was admitted to the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange where it trade under the ‘AT’ ticker. Although new institutional investors came forward, the company said the current owners – London-based investment firm Buckthorn and financial institution APICORP – shall remain significant shareholders.

"Var Energi IPO on the way, say owners Eni and HitecVision",https://www.energyvoice.com/markets/381819/var-energi-ipo/,"24/01/2022, 7:50 am",2022-07-21,"An initial public offering (IPO) is to be launched for Norwegian operator Var Energi, ownership partners Eni and HitecVision have announced. The exploration and production firm was launched in 2018 through the merger of Eni Norge, which owns 69.85%, and Point Resources, a HitecVision company, with 30.15%. The duo have announced their intent to launch an IPO for Var Energi and for the company to apply for a listing on the Oslo Bors, although they did not indicate a timeline. Doing so will “provide access to the Norwegian international capital markets, allow the company to diversify its ownership structure and create a strong long-term shareholder base”, the pair said. In a joint press release, Eni said the move is part of its strategy to “free up new resources” to be used in its energy transition strategy. Eni will retain a majority stake in Var Energi, it added, with both HitecVision and Eni “committed to strengthening Var Energi’s position as a leading player on the NCS”. The IPO is expected to consist of a public offering in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark and a private placement to certain institutional investors internationally. Since launching in 2018, Var Energi has built its profile through big money deals such as the acquisition of ExxonMobil’s Norwegian portfolio for £3.6 billion, covering 20 producing fields, in 2019.

IPO planned for Fred Olsen offshore wind business,https://www.energyvoice.com/renewables-energy-transition/wind/385074/ipo-planned-for-fred-olsen-offshore-wind-business/,"03/02/2022, 3:27 pm",2022-07-21,"Fred Olsen’s offshore wind installation and servicing business, Windcarrier, is planning an initial public offering (IPO) on the Oslo Stock Exchange and will order a fourth newbuild vessel in anticipation of growing demand. In a February 3 update Fred Olsen Windcarrier (FOWIC) said it would seek to raise around €150 million (£126m) in a listing, in part to fund a fourth newbuild vessel for its installation fleet. Parent company and Fred Olsen owner Bonheur said it would remain a long-term majority shareholder and has pre-committed to subscribe for €25m (£21m) in the IPO. FOWIC said it had received “significant anchor interest” from Nordic institutions, international sector specialists as well as other local and international investors. The Oslo-headquartered company installs offshore wind turbines and provides wind operations and maintenance services, and currently operates three purpose-built transportation and installation (T&I) jack-up vessels Since delivery of its first vessels the company says it has installed approximately 20% of all offshore wind turbines globally with the exception of China, and with an established client base, describes itself as a “first mover” in new markets outside Europe. As of January 2022, it said total revenue backlog stands at approximately €355m (£297m), around 18% of which is options. Given the anticipated increase in offshore turbine size, FOWIC is currently undertaking an investment program for its three existing vessels to future-proof them for next-generation installation projects. Upgrades, including a new 1,600-tonne crane and additional deck space, are now being fitted to its Bold Tern vessel, with expected completion in Q2 this year. While it notes a slight delay due to COVID challenges, it said any associated cost are covered by the yard. Its two remaining vessels will be upgraded in 2024 and 2025 after completion of several planned T&I projects. FOWIC chief executive Alexandra Koefoed said today: “We are proud of how Fred Olsen Windcarrier over the last decade has been part of shaping what today is a truly global industry through establishing its position as one of the leading wind turbine installation contractors in the world. “As the activity within this industry is set to further increase in the years to come, we are confident that Fred. Olsen Windcarrier will leverage on its extensive experience and trusted client relationships to further develop our already strong project pipeline.” Subject to approvals from the Oslo Stock Exchange and the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority, the company said it expects its first day of trading within Q1 2022. It has enlisted Arctic Securities and DNB Markets as joint coordinators and bookrunners for the offering. FOWIC will make further announcements relating to the IPO in due course. It follows news in November that Bonheur would create a new Fred Olsen unit tasked with developing floating wind and solar technology. "
Ashtead Technology enjoys solid debut on AIM market,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/north-sea/subsea/366792/ashtead-technology-aim-market/,"24/11/2021, 7:02 am",2022-07-21,"Ashtead Technology enjoyed a solid debut on the London Stock Exchange’s AIM market yesterday. The Aberdeen-based subsea equipment company is the fifth in Scotland to have listed on the junior market, which Mike Timmins, EY’s strategy and transaction partner has said is “great news” for corporate ambitions north of the border. Ashtead joins meal delivery service Parsley Box, battery maker AMTE Power and Artisanal Spirits, owner of the Scotch Malt Whisky Society – and another, Calnex, which listed at the end of last year – which are among the Scottish companies to raise funds on the London markets in the last 12 months. However, while the number is high for Scotland, demand for initial public offerings (IPOs) has been far higher in other areas of the UK with the likes of Made.com and Victoria Plumbing, which achieved the largest IPO on AIM with £1 billion in June. Mr Timmins said: “It is more than the norm here in the last 12 months but if you compare it to Manchester and North West or the Midlands or London it’s just on a different scale.” Last week, Ashtead Technology revealed it had reached a market valuation of nearly £130 million in its IPO after it received support from new institutional investors. The company said it had agreed a placing of 31,832,800 ordinary shares at 162p per share. Last night the company’s shares closed at the same level, having hit a high of 170p during the day. Shareholders pocketed more than £36m through the public offering, with gross proceeds to the company of £15m. "

Shareholders have pocketed more than £36million through the public offering, with gross proceeds to the company of £15million. The market capitalisation of £128.9million falls short of the lower-end of expectations mooted by the company last month of £130m – £180m. Ashtead Technology, based in Aberdeenshire, will trade on the London Stock Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on November 23. Admission documents show the company will trade with a starting share price of 163pence with the “AT” ticker. The firm said it has received support from new institutional investors through an initial public offering (IPO), but the current owners – London-based investment firm Buckthorn and financial institution APICORP – shall remain significant shareholders. Ashtead Technology chief executive Allan Pirie said: “This development marks another exciting milestone in the evolution of Ashtead Technology. “As a newly listed company, we plan to continue to grow and strengthen our core business in subsea technology rental and solutions both organically and through acquisition to further broaden our range of complementary equipment and services and expand our geographic presence. “Our IPO will allow us to continue supporting the energy transition and capitalise on the significant expected increase in expenditure in the global offshore wind market, while maintaining Ashtead Technology’s position as a leading independent subsea equipment rental business.” So far this year, Ashtead Technology has invested £8million in new subsea equipment and technology, and has increased its workforce by 34, taking employee headcount to 204. It has said that revenue increased 25% in the six months to June 30, compared to the first half of 2020, and has won contracts to support construction and installation of the Neart na Gaoithe (NnG) offshore windfarm, in the Firth of Forth. The offshore renewables energy market now accounts for 30% of Ashtead Technology’s revenue. Meanwhile, Bill Shannon has joined the company’s board as non-executive chairman, along with two other non-executives – Thomas Thomsen, former Vestas and Areva Wind director and Tony Durrant, former CEO of Premier Oil before its merger with Chrysaor to form Harbour Energy. Mr Pirie added: “I’m very pleased to be welcoming Bill, Thomas and Tony to the Board. They bring high calibre public company and energy sector experience that will be invaluable as we seek to deliver our growth ambitions for our existing and our new shareholders.”   "
ADNOC Drilling IPO raises $1.1bn after investors place $34bn of orders,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/middle-east/352732/adnoc-drilling-ipo-2/,"28/09/2021, 7:16 am",2022-07-21,"ADNOC (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) has announced that it has raised more than $1.1billion through the IPO of its subsidiary ADNOC Drilling, which was vastly oversubscribed. Investors placed more than $34 billion of orders for Abu Dhabi-based Adnoc Drilling Company PJSC’s $1.1 billion initial public offering, further underscoring the global clamor for equity deals. ADNOC sold 11% of the subsidiary in what ranks as the biggest stock-sale yet in the emirate. Adnoc Drilling’s shares were offered at 2.30 dirhams each and will begin trading in Abu Dhabi on Sunday at 10 a.m. local time. The deal comes as IPO activity in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, particularly for energy and commodity companies, picks up. Valuations have been bolstered by this year’s surge in raw-material prices as economies recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Adnoc Drilling’s IPO is expected to be followed soon by those of Emirates Global Aluminium and Fertiglobe Holding, a fertilizer company part-owned by Adnoc. In Saudi Arabia, a $1.2 billion listing of ACWA Power International — the biggest in the kingdom since that of oil giant Aramco in 2019 — will probably price on Monday. Adnoc, which pumps almost all the UAE’s oil and gas, is increasingly seeking to raise money from its assets and help the government fund efforts to diversify the economy. Since mid-2020, it has garnered about $15 billion by selling leasing rights over pipelines and property to the likes of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc. The IPO of Adnoc Drilling is the first since it sold some of its fuel-distribution business in 2017. The lead banks on Adnoc Drilling’s transaction were First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Adnoc will retain an 84% stake in the company, while Houston-based Baker Hughes will keep its 5% share. "

The Italian oil giant will keep a majority stake in the unit following the IPO which is expected to be completed in 2022, it said in a statement Thursday. Eni said in April it was reviewing options aimed at maximizing the value of the newly created unit. The Italian company may raise over 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in the IPO, Italian daily MF reported earlier this week. The unit is on target to develop more than 6 GW of renewable capacity by 2025 and more than 15 GW by 2030, with its retail customer base growing from 10 million customers today to over 15 million over the same period, Eni said.  Eni sees earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of the unit, which it calls Eni R&R, to double to 1.2 billion euros in 2025 from 2021.

UAE oil producer ADNOC to list drilling unit in Abu Dhabi IPO,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/middle-east/347828/adnoc-drilling-ipo/,"06/09/2021, 8:03 am",2022-07-21,"Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC) is planning to sell shares in its drilling unit in what would rank among the largest initial public offerings (IPO) in the United Arab Emirates. The company will offer at least 7.5% of Adnoc Drilling, it said on Monday. An IPO could value the business at up to $10 billion, Bloomberg reported earlier this year, citing people familiar with the matter. In 2018, when Baker Hughes bought a 5% stake in Adnoc Drilling, that deal valued it at about $11 billion, including $1 billion of debt. Given the valuation, a sale of that size could raise about $750 million and Adnoc said it may increase the amount of stock on offer. It will be the second IPO of one of the group’s subsidiaries after the share sale in its retail fuel unit for $850.8 million in 2017. The proposed listing comes as Abu Dhabi tries to revive IPOs on its bourse. The bourse, known as ADX, is offering sweeteners that include flexibility on the minimum stake size required for share sales and promising to reduce or forgo listing fees. Satellite operator Yahsat listed in July, and sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co. is poised to select underwriters for a potential offering of Emirates Global Aluminium that could value it at more than $15 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said last week. Adnoc has also started preparations for a potential IPO of its fertilizer joint venture Fertiglobe. Abu Dhabi, which holds most of the oil in the UAE, is using its energy assets to draw in global investors along with their funds and expertise as the nation puts cash into efforts to diversify the economy. While the UAE plans to keep selling oil for decades it’s trying to build out industries like technology, manufacturing and tourism to prepare for a world in which hydrocarbon demand is falling. The UAE is the third-biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Adnoc is pursuing a strategy of attracting investors and raising cash from minority stakes in its businesses. Regional energy powerhouses like the Saudis are also selling energy assets and trying to wean themselves off an overwhelming reliance on crude for government income. The kingdom recorded the world’s largest IPO when it sold shares in Saudi Aramco in 2019. With governments and companies looking to go green and cut oil use, Saudi Arabia and the UAE see their huge reserves of low-cost crude and natural gas supporting chemicals and hydrogen production and establishing  them among the last suppliers of crude. Adnoc Drilling IPO Offer Details: -Offer period to start on Sept. 13 and end on Sept. 23 for retail investors -Will represent 1.2 billion shares -There will be three tranches. First for individuals and others investors: offering closes on Sept. 23 -Second for qualified institutional investors: offering closes on Sept. 26 -Third for Adnoc employees and UAE national retirees: offering closes on Sept. 23 -Announcement of final offer price: Sept. 27 -Expected date of listing: Oct. 3 -First Abu Dhabi Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan are joint global coordinators -EFG-Hermes, Emirates NBD Capital, International Securities, Merrill Lynch International and Societe Generale are joint bookrunners "
Ineos-backed hydrogen fund splurges £50m in first five months,https://www.energyvoice.com/renewables-energy-transition/hydrogen/379317/ineos-backed-hydrogen-fund-splurges-50m-in-first-five-months/,"13/01/2022, 12:31 pm",2022-07-21,"A pioneering clean hydrogen investment fund has paid out around £50 million since starting up. Launched in July, HydrogenOne Capital Growth (HGEN) bills itself as the first London-listed fund dedicated to the clean hydrogen revolution. It aims to be the “sector specialist” in the clean fuel, investing primarily in private opportunities not readily accessible elsewhere. HGEN (LSE: HGEN) raised £107m as part of its launch last year, £25m of which came from petrochemicals giant Ineos. Of that initial pot, 46% (£50.29m) has subsequently been deployed into hydrogen sector companies – the fund excludes fossil fuel producers. “This comprises 19 listed positions for an aggregate of 9% of the net proceeds, and 3 private companies accounting for a total of 37% of the net proceeds,” HGEN said. The investments span the full value chain, including critical components for green and turquoise, that made through a process called methane pyrolysis, hydrogen supply. Over 90%, of the deployed capital is in the UK and Europe. Based on current estimates HGEN expects to fully deploy the proceeds from its 2021 initial public offering (IPO) by the second quarter of this year. Since its launch the fund has observed “strong momentum” in the hydrogen sector. Numerous pledges were made as part of COP26 and a further nine countries have published hydrogen roadmaps, taking the total to 39. At the end of 2021, there were at least 500 hydrogen projects announced world-wide, an increase of over 100% in the year, HGEN said. And full value chain spending in announced clean hydrogen could reach $700 billion by 2030. HGEN alone says it has identified an investible universe of over £17bn in private hydrogen assets, in operational companies and hydrogen projects. In order to assist in the financing of these investment opportunities, options are currently being considered for raising further capital. Simon Hogan, chairman of HGEN, said: “We are very encouraged by the progress HGEN has made since its IPO last summer as the first listed fund dedicated to clean hydrogen for the energy transition to net zero. “HGEN has completed a number of transactions, building on the strong momentum in the sector. “With deployment from our latest fundraise now well underway, and with a robust and exciting pipeline of potential deals we are seeing HGEN’s growth potential. “The business is considering options for raising further capital so we can continue to deploy substantial growth capital into energy transition and unlock value for shareholders in this sector.” "
INEOS-backed hydrogen fund invests £10m in HiiROC,https://www.energyvoice.com/renewables-energy-transition/368163/ineos-backed-hydrogen-fund-invests-10m-in-hiiroc/,"29/11/2021, 7:56 am",2022-07-21,"Ineos-backed HydrogenOne Capital Growth has announced it will make an equity investment of £10m in ‘turquoise hydrogen’ technology developer HiiROC, as part of a major fundraising round. HiiROC’s technology converts biomethane or natural gas into clean hydrogen and carbon black, through a proprietary electrolysis process using thermal plasma. The company says this results in “zero CO2 hydrogen production”, known as “turquoise hydrogen”, at a cost comparable to the steam methane reforming process, and only using only one fifth of the energy required by water electrolysis. The solid carbon byproduct, carbon black, has applications ranging from tyres, building materials and as a soil enhancer. With the purchase of a minority equity stake, HydrogenOne will also have rights to a board seat at HiiROC. The investment forms part of a roughly £26 million fundraising round for HiiROC, and includes investments from Melrose Industries, Centrica, Hyundai and Kia, alongside existing strategic investors Wintershall Dea and VNG. HiiROC says this system has strong potential for a range of sectors including grid injection, electricity generation, decarbonising industry replacing natural gas, flare mitigation and synthetic aviation fuel production. Wintershall Dea and VNG have recently announced a 400kg per day hydrogen facility in Germany using HiiROC technology, due to be operational in 2023. HydrogenOne Capital Growth (HGEN) was formed in July 2021, with the aim of raising £250million through an initial public offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange, including a £25 million investment by INEOS. Including its HiiROC commitments, HydrogenOne says it has deployed around 10% of its assets under management in a portfolio of clean hydrogen listed equities, and approximately 40% of the net proceeds from its IPO. The refining and chemicals company has emerged as a major proponent of hydrogen technologies, last month announcing plans to invest around £1.7 billion in green hydrogen production facilities across Europe. HiiROC CEO Tim Davies said: “We welcome HydrogenOne as a sector specialist at this very exciting stage in our development, as we move towards the commercialistion of our leading technology to produce low-cost, zero emission hydrogen, delivered to customers on a modular, scalable basis at the point of demand. “HiiROC’s technology is well positioned to contribute to accelerating the transition to the hydrogen economy and its role in achieving Net Zero.”   "

Ashishkumar Chauhan is not new to the National Stock Exchange of India; he was part of the core team that set up the exchange back in 1992-1993. Chauhan spent eight years at NSE before he left to join Reliance Industries Ltd.Yet, Chauhan's return to NSE, at a time when the exchange's relationship with the regulator is seen to be at an all-time low, poses the biggest challenge for a veteran who was instrumental in setting up screen-based trading and launching the benchmark Nifty index.To be clear, NSE in 2022 is not the same exchange that Chauhan had left in 2000 when it was in the hands of colleagues who today face regulatory and multi-agency probes.In the second half of these two decades away from NSE, Chauhan has strategised and led a competitive battle against the dominance of the National Stock Exchange, as the CEO of the Bombay Stock Exchange. Despite that enhanced competition and even with all the regulatory troubles it has faced over the same years, NSE has been able to consolidate its market share in some key market segments and grew its revenue and profit three-fold in the five years that Vikram Limaye was CEO. NSE's Tech Strengths And WeaknessesA systemically important market infrastructure institution as the country's largest stock exchange, NSE has been able to consolidate its market share in equity capital markets, equity derivatives and currency derivatives. Soon, it will also transition the Nifty Futures traded on the Singapore Exchange to NSE IFSC Ltd., the international exchange platform set up at GIFT City in Gujarat. This would bring trading volumes—that were hitherto overseas—onshore to India, a move that Chauhan was a signatory to when NSE, BSE, and MSEI released a joint statement in February 2018 to end all licensing deals that involved sharing of product prices with overseas exchanges. The idea was to bring over volumes from Singapore and Dubai and is now a step away from reality.The tech-savvy Chauhan will bring expertise that would be welcome in the process of upgrading NSE's technology platforms. While NSE has its own technology arm that handles core operations. Chauhan will need to ensure a reduction in the technical snags that the NSE has faced frequently in recent years. At BSE, Chauhan ran a low-latency network but that did not prevent NSE from consolidating its position in various segments. Now, NSE gets an insider who knows both exchanges inside-out. Cleaning Up A MinefieldNSE's biggest challenge today is finding a resolution to the co-location and dark fibre probe. The multi-agency investigation has put NSE and its operations and, as a result, whoever has to run the institution in such times, in a constant state of flux.Taking the top job just months after recent orders by SEBI against the exchange's past leaders, would require Chauhan to use all his expertise to untie the knots NSE finds itself in.Chauhan's eventual success would also be gauged on whether he can successfully steer NSE to a long-awaited initial public offering and listing. Five years ago, when Chauhan had applied for the NSE top post, he was in the middle of taking Asia's oldest stock exchange, BSE, public. In comparison, NSE's IPO is not going to be an easy process, as SEBI's confidence in the institution will have to be restored in good measure, for the regulator to allow the IPO to proceed. That appears difficult with the investigations that are underway and in the immediate aftermath of SEBI's recent orders.Chauhan has to mend NSE's image with the regulator and other authorities not just for its IPO, but also to let the exchange be allowed to introduce new cutting-edge products. Chauhan's team at BSE was credited for creating some of the most innovative products introduced at BSE like the BSE StAR MF platform.In each of these aspects, Chauhan will need to deftly navigate the regulatory minefield that the exchange keeps getting caught in."
IPOs: SEBI Mulls Option For Pre-Filing Of Offer Documents,https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/ipos-sebi-mulls-option-for-pre-filing-of-offer-documents,"9:53 PM IST, 11 May 2022",2022-07-21,"Securities Exchange Board Of India on Wednesday proposed introducing an alternative mechanism for regulatory review by permitting 'pre-filing' of offer document for companies contemplating initial public offerings. Securities Exchange Board Of India on Wednesday proposed introducing an alternative mechanism for regulatory review by permitting 'pre-filing' of offer document for companies contemplating initial public offerings. Under the proposal, an issuer should make 'pre-filing' of offer document with SEBI and stock exchanges without making it available for public for an initial scrutiny period only, according to a consultation paper. The document should contain all disclosures as required currently under the Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements Regulations. Generally, the current process for an Initial Public Offering entails at least 30 to 70 days after filing of Draft Red Herring Prospectus before the issuer company can access capital markets. Further, the issuer company may choose to not pursue coming out with its IPO after undergoing the process. SEBI noted that one of the concerns for issuer companies was disclosure of sensitive information in the DRHP, which may be beneficial to its competitors, without the certainty that the IPO would be executed. ""Another concern is with regards to timing the public issue vis-a-vis market conditions. Any delay due to such factors results in concerns regarding the 'recency' of the feedback obtained from potential institutional investors during the road shows, thus impacting the pricing as well estimating the issue size,"" SEBI noted. To ease the concerns, the Primary Market Advisory Committee discussed the matter and favourably considered permitting 'pre-filed' document with SEBI.The Securities and Exchange Board of India has sought comments from public on the proposal till June 6. Globally, many jurisdictions such as U.K., Canada and U.S. permit pre-filing of the offer document for review by the regulatory authority. In the consultation paper, SEBI has suggested that an issuer should make a public announcement stating that it has done pre-filing of offer document with SEBI and exchanges. The issuer company should mention that pre-filing of offer document need not necessarily mean that the issuer will undertake the IPO. The issuer and lead managers should also submit an undertaking that it will not undertake any marketing or advertising campaign which refers to its intended IPO or showcases any key performance indicators through any means to public, including social media. Further, stock exchanges should provide in-principle approval on the pre-filed document and SEBI should give its observations on the pre-filed document within 30 days from the receipt of reply to clarification from lead merchant banker or in-principle approval from the stock exchanges. Pursuant to receipt of SEBI's observations, an issuer, if it so desires based on market conditions and its own financial requirements, may decide to pursue undertaking the IPO. In this regard, the issuer has been suggested to file an updated DRHP, a public document, incorporating all observations provided by SEBI. The updated DRHP should be available on websites of the issuer company, lead merchant bankers, stock exchanges and SEBI for period of at least 21 days for public comments. The issuer and lead merchant bankers can undertake marketing of the issue only post updated DRHP filing. Further, merchant bankers upon expiry of the period of 21 days should file with SEBI details of the comments received by them or the issuer from the public. It should also submit the consequent changes, if any, that are required to be made in the draft offer document. The regulator should take note of the changes made to the updated DRHP and subsequently, the issuer may file the RHP, a public document, with Registrar of Companies, stock exchange(s) and SEBI. The subsequent procedure with respect to price band advertisement/issue opening will remain the same."

GET READY TO INVEST: Nassau Cruise Port IPO for Bahamians expected in October,https://ewnews.com/get-ready-to-invest-nassau-cruise-port-initial-public-offering-for-bahamians-expected-in-october-says-mike-maura-ceo,"August 3, 2021",2022-07-21 12:17:09.666445,"
Maura: It is very important that thousands of Bahamians are given the opportunity to invest in the Nassau Cruise Port
NASSAU, BAHAMAS — Bahamians will get an opportunity to own an equity stake in the Nassau Cruise Port when an initial public offering (IPO) for small investors is launched in October, according to cruise port CEO Mike Maura Jr.
In an interview with Eyewitness News, Maura said: “We expect that to happen in October of this year. Come October, we should be somewhere around the 80 percent complete stage in marine works, and we would have broken ground on our upland works.”

Maura added: “It is very important that at a time such as this, when thousands of Bahamians are given the opportunity to invest in the Nassau Cruise Port, that they have an opportunity to come down and see what’s been going on for the past year and a half.
“We do appreciate that for many of these investors it may be the first time they are investing in a company generally. We want to provide them with opportunity to be educated and informed at the time of their investment.”
The IPO had originally been targeted for the second quarter of this year. The offering of a close to $25 million equity stake in Prince George Wharf’s transformation had been delayed until the 2021 third quarter in the hope that the economy would have rebounded sufficiently from the COVID-19 pandemic.



Bahamian investors will be given the opportunity to make the minimum $1,000 investment in the Bahamas Investment Fund (BIF), the vehicle that will hold a combined 49 percent stake in the cruise port on their behalf.
The Nassau Cruise Port is currently in the middle of a dredging operation, which began last week. Maura estimated there is another 10 to 12 days of dredging to be carried out.
“We are about close to 65 to 70 percent on the marine works and we are going to be breaking ground this month on the upland works,” said Maura.
“The upland works would include the arrivals terminal, Junkanoo museum, marketplace where we will have up to 50 authentically Bahamian entrepreneurs selling their retail items as well as food and beverage, then go into the plaza with the bigger businesses.”
The new cruise port is expected to be ready by summer 2022.

NASSAU, BAHAMAS – Works Minister Desmond Bannister and Shell North America yesterday confirmed an initial public offering (IPO) for shares in the company’s liquified natural gas (LNG) facility, could be on the horizon.

Bahamas Power and Light (BPL) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Shell NA for an integrated LNG gas-to-power project just over a year ago.

A Shell spokesperson told Eyewitness News: “The plans are that Shell and BPL would form a joint venture for the ‘Power Company’ part of the project.

“The ‘Terminal Company’ would also be formed as a joint venture with Shell as the largest shareholder and certain minority interest shareholders from the Bahamas.”

The spokespersons continued: “We are in commercial discussions and will share further details when we are able.

“In the future, there may be the opportunity for the ‘Terminal Company’ to issue shares in an IPO to Bahamians, subject to market conditions and further discussions amongst shareholders.”
Works Minister Desmond Bannister confirmed these developments in an interview with Eyewitness News Online,

“I am aware. What they are doing is in accordance with our manifesto committment,” he said.

“That commitment he noted called for privatizing the utility to ensure Bahamian ownership through majority shareholding as well as providing incentives and tax concessions for the production and supply of alternate fuel sources.”

Shell NA is among the largest global energy marketers and traders, providing a comprehensive portfolio of energy-related products and services an is a pioneer in LNG.

The LNG plant is expected to produce up to 270 megawatts of power.

         Different Stripe – fintech success story enters choppy waters",https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/different-stripe-fintech-success-story-enters-choppy-waters-41842403.html,"
    July 17 2022 02:30 AM
",2022-07-21,"When Stripe closed its latest funding round early last year, it had much to celebrate, not least its new valuation of $95bn (€95.3bn). It made the 12-year-old company one of the most valuable privately held tech companies in the world while it boasted of processing $640bn worth of payments a year. The company, founded by Limerick brothers Patrick and John Collison, is truly a global success story, feted by investors and customers alike. Stripe seemingly could do no wrong. But a series of bumps in the road in recent months have challenged Stripe’s standing, whether it is allegations of impropriety by rivals or discontent among some workers. This is against a backdrop of an intensifying economic downturn which all fintech and payments companies are feeling. Fintech has experienced the wrath of the stock market slump, which has bled into the private markets, according to investment analysis firm Pitchbook. In a recent report it flagged Stripe as one of the late-stage payments and fintech companies “likely to be affected by public market valuation re-ratings”. Then on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company had cut the internal value of its shares by 28pc. According to the report, the company told employees in an email that its internal share price was about $29, compared with $40 in the previous internal valuation. Other large privately held fintech companies have suffered falling valuations of late. Klarna, the Swedish buy-now-pay-later player, closed a funding round this week of $800m that valued it at $6.7bn, a staggering decline from the $45.6bn price tag it had a year ago. Stripe had not been immune from value markdowns in recent months either. Fidelity Investments, one of the company’s high-profile backers, twice marked down the value of its shares in the Collisons’s company from $41.81 per share at the start of the year to $27.15 in May.  The big question will be what happens if Stripe tries to raise money again in the next 12 to 18 months. Robert Le, senior analyst at Pitchbook, told the Sunday Independent he remained reasonably positive about Stripe’s potential valuation into the future. However, much depends on whether or not it needs to raise funds during this turbulent time for tech stocks. “[The valuation] was really high but they can grow into that valuation as long as they continue to find some growth over the next 18 months. If they don’t need to raise a round, they’ll be fine,” Le said. “If they are burning a lot of cash – my understanding is that they’re not, but if they are – or for some reason they have a shorter runway and they have to raise a round over the next 12 to 18 months, then it would be very likely there will be a down round and they will get a valuation cut.” The atmosphere for raising money, whether it is start-ups or later stage giants like Stripe, will be a much colder one in the environment of inflation, high interest rates and cost cutting.

 At the onset of the pandemic, fears swirled about tech companies’ ability to raise capital but the opposite proved true, with venture capital investors deploying massive cheques in 2020 and 2021. Le said those heady days are over now. “We’re not going to see that environment in tech valuations anymore, so I think there’s going to be a reset where we’re moving back towards the mean,” he said. “You’re going to start seeing, over the next six to 12 months, a lot of down rounds.” Stripe has been ploughing ahead with new products – many of which are developed at its EMEA headquarters in Dublin – and has successfully diversified its product portfolio beyond its core of payment processing, with services in tax, compliance and open banking. Its fierce expansion has, however, brought criticisms of late, namely from rivals. The chief executive of Plaid, the US open banking fintech firm, accused Stripe in a now-deleted tweet of impropriety in launching a product similar to Plaid’s, claiming information was obtained through interviews for a role at Plaid. In January Ryan Breslow, the founder of Bolt, another payments processor, accused Stripe of running a monopoly that walled out other fintech start-ups from raising money. Speaking at a conference in Amsterdam last month, Stripe’s John Collison hit back at the allegations and said that the company was “pretty unapologetic” about its product expansion and moving into other areas where competitors play. “Sometimes we launch a product first and then other people come along and develop competitors to that,” Collison said. “Sometimes there will be someone else in the market with a product like Plaid, and then we will enter a space with a similar product but with pure differentiation for customers.”

 Philip Benton, a fintech analyst at market research firm Omdia, said that these conflicts are to be expected for any company that grows to the size that Stripe has. “That’s only natural the bigger you get. There’s more criticism and people are going to accuse you of having a monopoly and so forth.” Benton said that Stripe venturing into a nascent area like open banking, where Plaid exists, is an acknowledgment that there is a future in it. Open banking, which refers to the sharing and use of financial data across various applications, has seen a swathe of start-ups emerge in the last several years. “If there’s a big opportunity in open banking, it would be naive of Plaid to think that Stripe wouldn’t want to be involved, and actually it’s almost a testament that you’re in the right industry if someone like Stripe is looking to compete with you,” Benton said. “I don’t think they’re necessarily ripping off people’s products. “It’s just they used to be more of a first mover, because they were smaller, whereas now they’re more of a fast follower in terms of the products that they’re bringing out.” The criticism is not just external though. Stripe employs more than 8,000 people across more than 20 offices internationally. Last month tech news outlet The Information reported that there was disquiet among the ranks of the company over bonus pay. Some staff, it reported, were entitled to receive their annual bonuses in the form of equity, which could prove to be a hot ticket some day. However, at the time, the company’s sales staff would not be eligible for equity-based bonuses, leading to frustration among the sales division and how they are viewed compared to other divisions in the company. It is understood that since the report the company has made changes to its bonus programme for sales staff to receive equity. ""Stripe's go-to-market team has more than tripled in size since I started in 2020, and we have a very diverse and rapidly growing set of users,"" said Stripe's chief revenue officer Mike Clayville. ""Startups continue to be a top priority, users like Substack, Carousell, TripActions and Ambrook–60 percent of tech companies that went public in 2021 are on Stripe. ""We are also seeing significant momentum in the enterprise space with folks like Ford, Maersk, Spotify, Twitter and Amazon, and we’re doubling down on that success. ""One of the things that drew me to Stripe is the fact that we are doing something that’s never been done before, so you have to have that builder mindset and be willing to experiment. “Make no mistake: scaling a hyper growth company is hard, and we recognise that in order to do it well, we have to start from a users-first lens across our decision making, how we structure our team, and almost everything we do. “Stripe is a demanding environment, and we are constantly iterating on our go-to-market approach to become more efficient, more effective and anticipate what users will need 5-10 years from now,” he said. Most notably, Stripe is one of the few major fintech companies that has not been cutting staff in recent months whereas Coinbase, Klarna and Robinhood have all been shedding employees to rein in their overheads. However, the matter of employee equity in Stripe – and who gets it – could become tense as speculation around a stock market flotation arises. It is an issue that bubbles up frequently as investors and analysts try to figure out what the Irish brothers’ long-term gameplan is. Stripe is 12 years old and has now raised over $2bn across several funding rounds. This means most investors are waiting patiently for a return on their investment. The Collisons have typically been sheepish about committing to a timeline for an IPO but have never ruled out a stock market debut. In the frothy days of 2020 and 2021 where it seemed fintech companies could only go up, there were a slew of IPOs or stock market listings via blank cheque firms called SPACs. Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange, was among them, first floating last year with an $86bn market cap but now has a $11bn valuation, thanks in large part to the recent crash in crypto values. The mood music on the public markets has changed for now. However, an IPO is not something that the Collisons can put on the long finger forever. “It depends on their runway in terms of cash and funding, how much can they afford to wait. “I think they’re too big to be acquired by anyone right now so the IPO seems like the natural route for them but they’ve always been a little bit coy about when that would be,” Benton said. “It’s probably sensible not to IPO now if you can wait but I would definitely expect it to happen in the next couple of years irrespective.” Pitchbook’s Le said he expects 2024 to be the earliest possible time for going public, “just based on what’s going on in the IPO markets, what’s going on in the macro environment”. Should Stripe weather the next year or so of economic uncertainty relatively unscathed, it could face renewed questions about going public. “I think eventually they have to. They raised their first venture funding in 2011, so it’s been 11 years, so you can imagine investors haven’t gotten their money out of Stripe yet.” "

         Government enjoying bank windfalls but losses are still lurking beneath the surface",https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/government-enjoying-bank-windfalls-but-losses-are-still-lurking-beneath-the-surface-41802569.html,"

",2022-07-21,"Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe seems to have found a handy formula for recovering the money the State put into Ireland’s ailing banking system more than a decade ago. Aided by a rising market for Irish bank shares, an improving rate environment and a strong post-Covid economic backdrop, the minister has been able to collect close to €1bn in cash from selling down the State’s positions in AIB and     Bank of Ireland in just the last year. But despite the welcome flow of funds into the State coffers, what’s really happening is the State is crystallising a loss on its overall investment in the banking sector. If you look beneath the surface it’s easy to see why. Taking the three surviving banks – AIB, Bank of Ireland and     Permanent TSB. According to the latest figures from the Department of Finance, the Government put in a total of €29.4bn between 2009 and 2011. Of that, €20.3bn has come back in cash from asset sales, bond redemptions and fee payments, leaving a €9.1bn gap.  Yet the value of the stakes the Government owns in those banks is just half that at €4.6bn. In all likelihood, most of that shortfall is not coming back and when the State sells at current valuations, it bakes in that difference. And that’s before we even get to the elephant in the room: IBRC. The entity formed to absorb Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide absorbed €34.7bn to cover the massive losses of those two lenders, but so far just €1.57bn has come out in the form of dividends. There is about €3.5bn in remaining assets there, but it’s unlikely they’ll be liquidated at full value. This week’s €305m placing of AIB stock was the latest mini-windfall produced for the Government from the strategy of gradually drip-feeding its bank shares into the market. Monday’s after-hours disposal of 5pc of the bank brought the State’s stake in AIB down to 63.5pc, from 71pc in January, and represented a rare opportunistic large transaction in the wake of smaller block trades and the bank’s recent buyback. Coming just as the National Asset Management Agency (Nama) was completing another €250m surplus transfer to the exchequer, the total of €555m made it a good week for paying back the bailout. The policy of whittling down the Government’s bank holdings rather than waiting for the right moment in turbulent markets to launch a big-bang public offering has resulted in a steady stream of such cash returns dating back to last summer. That’s when the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) started selling about 1pc of Bank of Ireland per month after holding an unchanged minority stake for years. Since June 2021, the Government has recouped more than €600m on Bank of Ireland, leaving a small 3pc stake that is expected to be sold in tranches over the next few months ahead of the departure of chief executive Francesca McDonagh in September.

 According to the most recent figures from the Department of Finance, there is just €155m to be gained from those remaining trades, but the real prize is the final privatisation of at least one Irish bank 11 years after the Government had to rescue the sector. The Department of Finance calculates its net position in the banks by adding up all the money it put directly into them and sets that against all the money that has come back out so far. On that measure Bank of Ireland has been a profitable bit of business for the State, which is nearly €2bn to the good, including about €1.5bn in fees collected on 2008’s bank guarantee scheme. AIB is less of a success. The State is still more than €5.6bn in the hole, even when the presumptive value of the minister’s majority stake is taken into consideration. In cash terms alone, the Government has recovered just a little more than half of the nearly €21bn it pumped into the lender to save it. However, the market value of the remaining 63.5pc in State ownership is close to €4bn, so there is big money still on the table. Indeed, the strong performance of Irish bank shares this year – Bank of Ireland has gained nearly 20pc and AIB is up a more modest 9pc – is working in the Government’s favour, making each new transaction relatively more profitable. Nonetheless, there is an argument that the NTMA was therefore selling cheaply in 2021 and might have been better off waiting for better pricing to offload the stakes. But that view ignores the positive impact of the disposal plans themselves, which improve the liquidity of the stocks and attract more institutional investors, thus supporting the price. So where next? The State will be out of Bank of Ireland in a few short months and AIB looks like it’s en route to being a majority private bank sometime next year if the NTMA can maintain the pattern of pairing regular block trades with the occasional big placing. That will be a major boost for CEO Colin Hunt, whose first priority has to be making sure the taxpayer gets value for money. Permanent TSB has thus far been left out and is carried on the Government’s books at a loss on current valuation. The solution there is likely to involve an IPO at some stage, as NatWest is coming in as a significant minority shareholder as part of PTSB’s deal to acquire mortgage and small business banking assets from Ulster Bank. The UK bank is taking the stake to retain some upside from the Ulster Bank debacle and will want to monetise its position at some point. An IPO is the obvious mechanism. What all this adding up of cash returns leaves out, however, is the uncalculated opportunity cost of having put €64bn into the banks in the first place. More than €45bn of that has come back in one form or another over the years – Nama for instance, will make a surplus of €4.5bn alone – but the austerity required to shoulder the expense caused lasting economic damage that cannot be so neatly quantified. All the same, it’s effectively a sunk cost. The money that rolls in from future share sales is far more politically tangible. "

",2022-07-21,"An eye-popping $17bn (€16.25bn) wipeout in market value has made Life Insurance Corp of India (LIC) one of the biggest wealth destroyers among Asia's initial public offerings this year. Having plunged 29pc since its May 17 debut, India's biggest ever IPO now ranks second in terms of market capitalisation loss since listing, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The drop puts it just behind South Korea's LG Energy Solution, which saw a more than 30pc peak-to-trough decline in its share price after an initial spike on debut. Almost a month after listing, LIC's $2.7bn IPO has turned out to be one of Asia's biggest new stock flops this year, as rising interest rates and inflation levels globally hurt demand for share sales and with India's stock market facing unprecedented selling pressure by foreigners. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex is down more than 9pc this year. LIC's shares are poised to fall for a 10th consecutive session, slipping as much as 5.6pc yesterday after a mandatory lock-up period for anchor investors ended on Friday. The rout has worried India's government, with officials saying the company's management will ""look into all these aspects and will raise shareholders' value"".

",2022-07-21,"Investors in the fourth Davy Private Equity Strategies (DPES) fund will hope to play the markets with success, after an earlier series delivered strong results from Roblox, the international gaming phenomenon. It is understood that Davy will soon close the new DPES fund, raising over $70m (€65.8m) and bringing total investment through the DPES series to more than $267m since it was first launched in 2015. Roblox was the biggest mobile game of 2020 in the US, surpassing Candy Crush, which had been the top game for the previous seven years. Its initial public offering in March 2021 gave it a market capitalisation of around $40bn. It is understood DPES 1 invested in Roblox Corporation in 2018 when it had a reported value of $2.5bn – which means the IPO price equated to an uplift of 16 times the investment over a three-year period. The Roblox market cap has been on a rollercoaster since then, going as high as $79bn and as low as $19.5bn, which would still be an eightfold uplift. The DPES funds make hundreds of investments, and Davy clients also benefited from the sale of Belron last year. Last December Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) Fund X announced the sale of its investment in Belron, owner of leading vehicle glass repair brands such as Autoglass. The two-part transaction included the sale of around 39pc of CD&R Fund X’s stake. This valued Belron at €21bn. CD&R Fund X had acquired its stake in Belron in February 2018 in a transaction that valued the company at €3bn, equating to a sevenfold uplift in value in around three and a half years. It is understood DPES was a much earlier stage investor, suggesting the uplift for Davy clients would have been materially higher. Prior DPES funds have delivered an annualised rate of return of between 22pc and 35pc. Clients are usually those with an investment portfolio of €1m with a minimum investment of €100,000 available for five to 12 years. Read the leading stories from the world of business.

                        ",2022-07-21,"AFTER indicating in recent months that it will soon be seeking to raise capital to facilitate its business growth activities, Regency Petroleum Limited (RPL) has now selected GK Capital Management (GKCM) as its financial advisor in that pursuit. According to GKCM, the engagement ""will likely result in an initial public offer (IPO) of RPL's ordinary shares via the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE)"". The Jamaica Observer understands that the funds are to be raised ""before the first quarter of 2023"", giving it a timeline of later this year, with the funds being ""within Junior Market limits should we IPO"" according to Ryan Strachan, vice-president of investor relations at GK Capital Management. The limit for companies raising funds with an intention to list on the Junior Market is $500 million, but it is not clear if Regency will seek to raise the maximum amount. Regency Petroleum, a petroleum marketing company licensed to distribute bulk petroleum products, was incorporated in Jamaica in May 2018 and is owned and operated by Andrew Williams and Jeneive Sabdul-Williams. The company put down roots in western Jamaica and has grown steadily since its inception to become a preferred supplier to numerous households, hotels, restaurants, bakeries, and other local industries, GKCM outlined in a release on Monday. Regency started out distributing solely LPG cylinders and has since added a retail division of petroleum products specific to gasoline and diesel fuel. ""Our current focus is developing the automotive petroleum segment of our business, and an injection of capital will fuel our strategic plans,"" opined Andrew Williams, CEO of Regency Petroleum, in a company release. Strachan, commented,  ""We are excited about this new professional relationship that we have established with Regency. We have always taken a keen interest in supporting businesses with high growth potential and helping them realise their capital growth objective."" GK Capital Management Ltd is the investment and advisory arm of GraceKennedy Limited, established in 2014. The firm is a licensed securities dealer, offering products and services regulated by the Jamaica Stock Exchange and the Financial Services Commission. Strachan stated, ""Given RPL's performance over the past four years, it is encouraging that they are likely to be the second company in the energy sector to pursue listing on the Jamaica Stock Exchange. These are indications of a broadening of the market and the resilience of the entrepreneurial spirit in Jamaica."" Patsy Latchman-Atterbury, managing director of GKCM, commented, ""It is admirable that in a time when businesses are still navigating the challenges of the [novel coronavirus] pandemic, RPL is laser-focused on building capacity and expanding their business. We are confident that GK Capital's advisory services will further strengthen Regency Petroleum's market position."" "

                Dolla going big after JSE listing

                        ",2022-07-21,"Due to the insatiable demand which came as a result of its historic listing on the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) Junior Market, Dolla Financial Services Limited will be raising new capital in the form of a bond to meet the rising demand for its loan products.  The microcredit company, which listed on June 15, set another record as it published its unaudited second quarter results last Friday when the JSE rules give companies up to 45 days to publish its quarterly reports. It was the second report to be published after Mayberry Jamaican Equities Limited, in the 'earnings season' for companies, whose quarter ended on June 30. Chief Executive Officer Kadeen Mairs explained that the company will be maintaining this standard going forward as it aims to have its financials ready by the eighth of each month for its board and within the first 15 days after the end of each quarter for publication on the JSE. ""We have a responsibility to the shareholders and the last thing we want to see is how we're writing for an extension after 45 days to present financial statements. Reconciliation takes the longest time and if you're doing your reconciliation up to date during the month, then at the end of the month, you don't have much to do,"" Mairs explained in an interview with the Jamaica Observer.  Although the initial public offering (IPO) was oversubscribed to the tune of $4.76 billion with 14,981 shareholders, Dolla only received half of the $500 million from the combined offer for sale. Despite only receiving $224.83 million in net proceeds, all of the money was lent out in June to demonstrate the demand coming to the company. Mairs admitted that the IPO's success reverberated throughout the Caribbean which has brought new-found regional attraction by variety of retail and institutional investors. ""Because of the marketing from the IPO that came around the brand, the demand for loans went up about tenfold. If a person never knew about Dolla before, he's aware of it now because of the IPO. We have more applicants to choose from which means we can disburse better quality loans. It's like an interview process where you'd have five people to choose from, you're going to choose the best of five. Now, when you can choose the best out of 10, you have more options,"" Mairs explained on the impact of choosing to go public. While the consolidated net loan book was $1.05 billion at the end of June, about $94.41 million (GYD$130 million) is related to the company's Guyana operations which account for about nine per cent of its operations. The success of the Guyana operation has pushed it to fast-track the expansion of its operations into other parts of the South American country outside of its capital Georgetown. It will also be opening ninth Jamaican branch in Portmore, St Catherine, during the third quarter. As part of its focus to expand its regional presence, Dolla has engaged VM Wealth Management Limited (VMWM) to be its corporate financial advisors for an upcoming bond offering. The company will raise up to $1 billion under the FSC Exempt Distributions guidelines for accredited investors or to investors participating via the minimum purchase amount exemption. Dolla has an 11 per cent fixed rate loan to Derrimon Trading Company Limited which will be due on November 11 for US$1 million. Dolla has $300.36 million in debt due between April to October in 2023 to FirstRock Real Estate Investments Limited and bondholders. ""Retail [investors] believe in the brand. When we say 'We Lend', they know exactly what they're putting their money in. If you look at our top 10, it's mainly retail outside of DeQuity and FirstRock Private Equity. You still have institutions saying they'll put some money into a bond,"" Mairs added on the interest of retail investors who exuded tons of confidence in the company's IPO. He mentioned how persons put $20 to $50 million in individual applications based on their confidence in him. The bond raise would also result in the elimination of foreign exchange risk and extension of the tenure on its debt. Access Financial Services is currently aiming to raise $2 billion in a bond while ISP Finance Services Limited raised a public bond of $150 million in September 2016 on the JSE. Mairs also mentioned that the company's effective interest rate is double digits which will allow it to be comfortable with rising interest rates. While Mairs wouldn't get into the details of its overseas targets, he has engaged attorneys in several Caribbean territories to plot Dolla's expansion. There is a Dolla Belize and Panama profile on Instagram while Mairs discussed The Bahamas earlier this year as a target. The company is currently seeking out new independent board members to improve corporate governance and scope ahead of the Microcredit Act requirements. Dane Patterson and Lisa Lewis are the independent directors on the six-member board while the Act requires firms with a portfolio above $75 million to have at least a third of their board be independent. ""Just putting someone on a board because of their resume is not enough. If we need to call an extraordinary meeting with the board of directors, you want persons who believe that the company is important to them. Between the board of directors and chairman, we have a list of people that they're contemplating. It's just a matter of narrowing it down,"" Mairs added. The company is also starting a new venture outside of microfinance called Ultra which will be headed by former ATL executive David Henriques. The company is also pushing to broaden its renewable energy depth from international partners. Some 71 per cent of the company's loans are secured with business loans accounting for 74 per cent of the portfolio. The non-performing loans only made up six per cent of loans at the end of the quarter. ""There's a lot of funding internationally for renewable energy. If we are able to access it and on lend it here, it's a different ball game. The international companies want to reach the retail market, but they're not able to reach the market directly through an intermediary lender which will go through a commercial bank. A commercial bank isn't going to want to give a good customer to that intermediary when they can charge a higher interest rate and get all of the loans for themselves."" Dolla's stock price closed at $2.98 on Tuesday ahead of its $1 listing price which gave it a market capitalisation of $7.45 billion. ""My major focus right now is getting the results out to show people that it was not a fluke. The company is not close to plateauing in terms of its performance. Every company has a life cycle and I accept that, but this company's life cycle based on my age, we have at least another 25 years before you see us start to plateau. We can always pivot with technology based on the way the world is going. My biggest success from listing is not that I'm dealing with pension fund as the top 10, but I'm dealing with people,"" Mairs ended. GYD=Guyanese dollar "

                Regional stock exchanges aiming to bring more SMEs public
            ",https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/regional-stock-exchanges-aiming-to-bring-more-smes-public/,"
                            Jul 20, 2022 12:05 am
                        ",2022-07-21,"Several governments and relevant agencies across the Caribbean have teamed up with regional stock exchanges to improve the capacity of the small and medium enterprise (SME) businesses in a bid to further fuel economic growth.  The Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) has the most vibrant capital markets in the region which has been largely driven in recent years by the Junior Market (JM) which was started in April 2009. Companies that aim to list on the JSE's junior market must raise between $50 and $500 million in an initial public offering (IPO) and have at least 25 participating shareholders owning no less than 20 per cent of the fully paid, subscribed voting share capital after the offer. Once they aren't suspended, comply with the rules and remain listed for 15 years, they benefit from a tax holiday for the first five years and 50 per cent off the normal tax rate for the remaining five years. Every company also must have a mentor during its time as a listed company unless the JSE gives the company an exemption to not have a mentor. Mentors are approved by the JSE mentor registration committee and can serve multiple companies. The formation of the JSE's junior market pushed the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange (TTSE) to form the SME market as then finance minister Winston Dookeran had taken note of Jamaica's success and wanted to develop a similar market for a similar purpose. The SME was initially formed in 2012 with companies listing on that market benefiting from a reduction in the corporate tax rate charged being 10 per cent instead of the typical 25 per cent with this benefit being applicable for only 5 years. Companies aiming to list on the market would raise TT$5 million to TT$50 million and require at least 30 per cent of the shares to be held by at least 25 shareholders. Despite the best intentions, the SME only saw its first listing with Cinema One in November 2018 for TT$14.4 million, less than half of the TT$30.89 million targeted. Endeavour Holdings Limited listed in December 2019 and garnered TT$11.06 million, below the TT$18 million target. These are the only two companies listed to date with the SME Index down by seven per cent year to date with a market capitalization of TT$268.52 million. In a bid to improve the number of listings and capacity of SMEs, the T&T government amended the tax incentive to mirror the JSE's junior market set-up with companies exemptions on corporation tax, business levy and the green fund levy remaining. The amendments took effect at the start of the year. Also, the Ministry of Finance, is to provide assistance to the TTSE to operationalise and integrate the SME mentorship programme into the broader set of services currently provided to SMEs by various government agencies. The TTSE will also be amending its rules to include the requirement for a mentor for SME companies which must be approved by the TTSE before they are confirmed as a mentor to a company. The TTSE has requested the T&T Securities and Exchange Commission to review the Statement of Substance and Purpose to insert the new rule 400 (2). The Barbados Stock Exchange (BSE) is also undergoing a similar collaboration with the Caribbean Development Bank's (CDB) micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSME) Unit, Barbados Small Business Association (SBA) and the Ministry of Energy, Small Business and Entrepreneurship to improve the listings on the BSE's innovation and growth market (IGM). While the IGM has been around since October 1999, it was rebranded from the BSE Junior Market in 2019 when it was relaunched after the incentives were removed in 2018. The BSE has only seen three listings on that market as at December 2010 with a market capitalization of BB$15.1 million. It allows with BB$500,000 in gross assets excluding goodwill and equity capital of BB$200,000 to list on the IGM compared to the Main Market which has a requirement of BB$5 million in gross assets to be listed. The CDB is providing US$350,000 to support the 30-month programme. The Eastern Caribbean Securities and Exchange and the Guyana Stock Exchange don't have any special markets created for SME's at the moment. However, with the oil boom in Guyana, more companies are expected to grow in the improving economic environment. NCB Capital Markets Limited formed a Guyanese subsidiary in its 2021 financial year (FY) and has subsidiaries in Barbados and T&T. JMMB Group and The Bank of Nova Scotia have a presence in T&T, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic. The total amount raised since the the JSE's junior market inception in April 2009 stands at $17.9 billion with 45 actively listed companies, three graduated to the Main Market and one delisting. The JSE saw its fourth JM listing this year on June 15 in the form of Dolla Financial Services Limited which saw its $500 million combined initial public offering attracting $4.762 billion with 14,981 shareholders. Access Financial Services Limited (AFS) was the first company to list on the junior market in October 2009. The company raised $100.69 million at $1.83 per share, had an asset base of $608.48 million and paid $18.75 million in income taxes on $84.75 million in profit before tax (PBT). In its 2010 financial year, AFS earned $147.21 million in PBT and had a tax remission of $51.45 million. In their 2022 financial year, AFS had an asset base of $5.49 billion and paid $143.47 million in income taxes on $650.15 million in PBT. Its share price also closed at $23.24 which gave it a market capitalisation of $6.38 sbillion. Thus, while AFS has benefited from hundreds of millions in remitted taxes, the company is currently paying nearly three times in taxes than what was remitted in the 2010 financial year and nearly half of what it raised as taxes. It also paid $0.30 or $83.35 million in dividends on July 15 along with the original shareholders earning 1,167 per cent in capital gains since listing. Even recently, the JSE signed a memorandum of understanding with the Jamaica Manufacturers and Exporters Association to work closer with its members to assist them in listing on the junior market and push the number of companies on that market to more than 100. 20 companies under the Jamaica Business Development Corporation's (JBDC) accelerator programme are at the ready stage of listing, according to CEO Valerie Veira at a recent panel discussion. ""With this MOU, we are expecting that in short order we should have over 100 companies listed on the Junior Market. This will be exciting times for the markets. Please bear in mind that all companies that have come to market have been oversubscribed. This means that there is liquidity in the market and therefore now is the best time for any company that wants to list to come. There is no better person to give testament to the Junior Market than the current president of JMEA and that is why we are excited about this MOU,"" stated JSE Managing Director Marlene Street Forrest.

                        ",2022-07-21,"MICROFINANCE company Dolla Financial Services Limited, during the six-month or half-year period ended June 30, saw net profit surge to $119 million — almost six times more than or 473 per cent above that earned for the similar period in 2021.  Total income for the microlending entity also increased to $298 million, up 176 per cent over the prior year's half-year performance. The company, which listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) in May of this year, said the half-year results solidify its trajectory of consistent and strong performance. A subsidiary of the FirstRock Group, the financial institution raised over $4.5 billion from its oversubscribed initial public offer (IPO), and topped the charts after securing the largest number of shareholders listed to the Junior Market to date. ""Dolla's second quarter ending June 30, 2022 marked a significant milestone in the company's growth and development,"" the company said in notes accompanying its unaudited financials recently posted on the JSE's website. For the second quarter ended June 30, profits also grew to $59 million, 552 per cent above the $9.1 million earned in the corresponding quarter of 2021. Total income for the period amounted to $156.8 million. As at June 30, shareholders' equity — which increased to $693.4 million — represented a 73 per cent or $292.9-million increase when compared quarter to quarter, and an 86 per cent or $320.3-million increase when compared year-on-year. The $250 million earned from the issue of shares from the IPO, along with the increase in earnings during the quarter, were cited as the principal drivers of this increase by the company's directors. Commenting on the performance, Chief Executive Officer Kadeem Mairs credited the noteworthy results to the hard work of his team. ""We are extremely grateful for the results that we have been working assiduously to achieve. I can attest that our strategy has so far been the driver of our success, and we will continue to plan strategically to achieve even greater things as our crew is extremely capable and committed to carrying out our objectives,"" he said. Ryan Reid, CEO of FirstRock Group, was also elated about the overall performance of the growing subsidiary and expressed confidence for its continued progress. ""We ensured that Dolla entered the market with a strong posture and they have been journeying solidly thus far. I am pleased and am eagerly looking forward to the company's future endeavours,"" he stated. Aggressively pushing its growth objective, the company now has eight locations throughout the island. It is also busy planning for the roll-out of a new location in Portmore, St Catherine, which it expects to onboard during the third quarter which closes in September. Among its plans for regional expansion the company, through its Dolla Guyana Inc operation which has been set up to target new opportunities in the expanding economy of Guyana, indicated that it was also looking to broaden itsreach and venture outside of Georgetown.

                Kemal “Kaizen” Brown, a 4th industrial revolutionary

                        ",2022-07-21,"The Japanese philosophy of continuous improvement, known as Kaizen, has turned Kemal Brown into a fourth industrial revolutionary leading the charge for consistent change in this digital era. Brown is the founder and CEO of Digita Global Marketing Limited (DGM) and chairman of the Digita Global Group, which spans communications, real estate, venture capital, technology, and finance. The multifaceted Brown is also an international speaker, a member of the Global Shapers Community, the Forbes Business Council, and a former academic. Membership of the Global Shapers Community,  a subsidiary of the World Economic Forum, gave Brown the chance to focus on the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a greater appreciation of adopting digital transformation, and Jamaica’s need to be digital-ready. Fortunately for Brown, his extensive travels allowed him to experience diverse societies and ecosystems created at the intersection of human interaction and technology through digital literacy and robust digital infrastructure. Coupled with this, Brown believes that a new pathway could be forged in response to the need to upskill for the digital era in Jamaica. Therefore, he is determined to make an impact by first steering Jamaica towards the “true north” of digital transformation through digital marketing and communications. As he puts it, DGM aims to be the “nexus between opportunity and the skill and knowledge gaps that exist locally by taking a global approach to digital transformation, especially in the vein of communication”. DGM’s success is built on the overarching philosophy of Kaizen and a set of principles and processes codified as the “Digita Way” in homage to Silicon Valley giants like Apple, Netflix and Amazon. The process involves having an empathic understanding of the client’s persona to create impactful digital experiences by leveraging their knowledge of branding, design, marketing, and technology to achieve organisational goals on a global scale. The DGM team is persistent in monitoring the industry’s pulse, keeping abreast of the tools, technologies and new approaches to adequately support their client’s needs. Brown also notes that his company’s ability to be agile and iterate keeps Digita as one of the forerunners in the industry. He is convinced that public-private sector partnerships are crucial to solving infrastructural problems, such as affordable and reliable electricity systems, to complement the use and accessibility of high-speed Internet and broadband services. He also believes that removing high importation taxes, duties and fees on technological devices will facilitate greater access to these resources and even open the door to exploring the possibility of manufacturing these tools. The CEO shared the idea of subsidising solar energy as an alternative solution to further encourage a sustainable digital infrastructure. He believes that leaders across all sectors should adopt digital leadership by implementing a consistent change framework that prioritises data and insights to inform future decisions and enforce policies such as remote work. Additionally, Brown stresses that leaders must be true advocates for digital transformation and leverage technology as the “great enabler” that facilitates better experiences for society at large. For him, upskilling talent is a critical component of a digitally transformed society with educational programmes and curricula tailored to increase the workforce’s digital literacy and competence. As a newly appointed member of the Forbes Business Council, Brown is pleased that the platform will allow him to extend his global impact, influence, and network. He sees the honour bestowed on him as validation that even though Jamaica is geographically small, we are “tallawah” and can meaningfully contribute to global problems. Brown is looking forward to taking DGM public, via an initial public offering (IPO), leading to global expansion to diversify the group’s capabilities further, recruiting well-suited candidates for his management team and international board of directors. He is also excited to continue building out his real-estate holding and development company, Digita Properties, powered by cutting-edge smart home technologies and a service-oriented approach to real estate. Guided by Kaizen, the Japanese philosophy which promotes a mindset in which small incremental changes create an impact over time, Brown looks forward to being a catalyst for positive change for Jamaica and the rest of the world.

                Tips for new investors
            ",https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/tips-for-new-investors/,"

                        ",2022-07-21,"Many new investors are still not au fait with the workings of the stock market, especially after recent initial public offerings (IPO). Today’s Jamaica Observer publication will explain some of the concepts which many people missed during their rush to buy into IPOs.  An IPO is a process where the shares of a company become available to the wider public with an intention to list on a stock exchange. It can involve the issuance of new shares by the company, typically called the issuer, or an existing shareholder selling part or all of his shares to the public. The Dolla Financial IPO was a combined offer in which the company issued $250 million in new shares while First Rock Private Equity and DeQuity Capital Management sold $250 million worth of shares. The Dolla offer closed on the opening date of May 27 despite the prospectus listing a closing date of June 10. If an offer is oversubscribed, the issuer can request that the offer be closed early. Most public equity offers can be applied for online through the lead broker or a selling agent’s digital platform. Some issuers will include a form in the prospectus. It’s important that an applicant provides an up-to-date form of identification when applying. It would also be recommended that one only transfers the money once you’ve reached the stage at which payment details are requested. Don’t forget to send the money to the respective account as the application can be cancelled once the funds aren’t present. Also, follow up with your broker if they are supposed to transfer funds to the lead broker to satisfy the payment requirements of the offer. Once the offer is closed, the lead broker will send the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) the basis of allotment details which will outline how many shares each successful applicant should receive. The lead broker will then send the refund to each applicant’s brokerage account or the bank account listed to receive the refunds. The issuer will then apply to the JSE to be listed. The JSE listing committee will review the application and if approved, the company will be listed. While one might have missed the chance to apply during the IPO, anyone with a JCSD (Jamaica Central Securities Depository) account can buy the shares of the company on the open market once the company is listed. Numerous investors flocked to purchase Dolla shares days after the listing. As a result, the stock halted up as the market opened at 9:30 and closed up 32 per cent for various days. The circuit breaker is a tool used by the JSE to manage volatility in the market. If a trade occurs which sees the stock trading 15 per cent above or below the reference price, the stock will be halted for an hour. The new reference price will be an average of the trigger price and close price. Thus, even if a stock closes at $30, if the reference price is $31, then the halt price would be $26.35 or $35.65. If you bought 10,000 units of a stock at $1 and the price is now $3, then you have an unrealised gain of $20,000. If you decide to sell the stock, you should recall that there’s a commission fee which varies by broker, a JSE fee and general consumption tax (GCT) applicable to those two fees which will be deducted from the proceeds of that sale. When you sell a stock, you either realise a gain or loss. Also, those proceeds would not be immediately available as cash if you had a transaction to do later in the day or tomorrow. The JSE uses a T+2 (Trade + two business days) settlement system which means a sale on a Monday would not be settled until Wednesday. Otherwise, most online trading platforms allow you to use the proceeds of a sale for other stock transactions despite the settlement time not being complete as yet. Although this new journey can be somewhat daunting, investing is not as complex as it’s made out to be. Just start the process and build your portfolio over time. Remember your goals and always monitor what’s happening in the environment as things change along with stock prices. "

                $750-m cap
            ",https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/750-m-cap/,"

                        ",2022-07-21,"THE Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) is exploring an overhaul of some of its rules to deepen investor participation in the market in the face of a push from the investor community.  Marlene Street Forrest, managing director of the JSE, said among the changes to be made are an increase in the maximum amount of funds companies can raise in an initial public offering ahead of listing on the Junior Market and the circuit breaker rule “to relax it a bit more.” Based on JSE rules, companies intending to list on the Junior Market are allowed to raise between $50 million and $500 million. However, Street Forrest said that maximum cap could be increased to $750 million if the Ministry of Finance approves a request to have it increased. “We have seen with the inflation and with the devaluation of the Jamaican dollar that the value of the funds to be raised has been depressed, so we have applied to the Ministry of Finance under whose purview it is to determine whether that cap can be improved, and we were recently given an update that it is under active consideration,” Street Forrest told the Jamaica Observer. “We should expect pretty soon that the ceiling will be moved from that $500 million and that would be a sweet sound to many companies and investors...giving them a little bit more bandwidth in terms of raising capital and stimulating the market too.” Companies raising capital in recent times have seen their offer for funds oversubscribed several times. D0lla Financial, the last company to raise capital and list on the Junior Market, sought the maximum $500 million from the public in its initial offering, but attracted a total of more than $4.7 billion. Given that it could not upsize the offer, the company had to return $4.2 billion to shareholders. JFP sought $280 million but attracted $675 million, EduFocal sought $130 million but attracted $428 million and Spur Tree Spices went to raise $335 million but attracted a total of $1.3 billion. “Arriving at the figure of $750 million, we did a simple maths,” Street Forrest said, “What we did was to work out what the Jamaican dollar was valued vis-a-vis the US dollar in 2009 when the Junior Market was started and we benchmarked it to the value of the dollar now...in order to take the cap back close to where we believe it will be comfortable for the Government and comfortable for the issuer.” She said as the years go by, the JSE will continue to ask for the cap to be reviewed. “We continue to make changes as the market evolves. When we started the Junior Market we didn’t have a rule that says at least 50 per cent of the proceeds of an initial public offering must come back to the company. So we keep making changes as we go along,” Street Forrest added. She said another change could see Junior Market companies being fined for breaching rules of the stock exchange. “We have made changes in terms of some of the rules within the Main Market that the Junior Market must attend to as well. One of the things I know that is under active consideration is that, as it is with the Main Market now, where there are breaches to the Main Market rules, there is a fine for each breach. I am pleased that the market has developed sufficiently that the Junior Market companies, which are very compliant based on the level of mentorship and governance, but we are going to put in place fines that means if they breach any of the rules, they will be fined. The proportion of shares offered to the public could also change. As it stands, companies going public must offer a minimum of 20 per cent of their shares to the market but Street Forrest said that figure is under consideration and could be increased to 25 per cent. A requirement is also being considered for companies to disclose efforts being made to preserve the environment. Street Forrest said it is one of the changes she wants to make before she demits office for retirement next year as a means of helping businesses to think about sustainability. “What we are going to be doing is not to put in hard and fast rules. But we are going to say to companies, you need to consider that pretty soon. From the standpoint of IFRS [International Financial Reporting Standard], there is a requirement for disclosure on the environment. So we don’t want our companies to be left behind. So we will be giving some benchmark as to what these things should be in terms of what they should have as active consideration in terms of their internal processes, in terms of the environment and matters related to the environment in communities in which they operate.” Also under consideration are changes to be made to the circuit breaker rules, especially for new listings. “On the first day of listing there is a possibility for the stock price to be traded in a band of plus or minus 30 per cent of the original price. We believe at this point that this is fair and should be allowed to continue,” Street Forrest outlined before adding, “As it relates to the circuit breaker, the stock exchange has it under some consideration, and let me just hasten to say, not to move the circuit breaker, but to do some amendments to the circuit breaker for a little bit more latitude.” “We know there has been many push in Twitter land for us to remove the circuit breaker, but we have always maintained that as we are now in a maturing market, it is important,” Street Forrest said while pointing out that the stock exchange is “listening to our investors and the market and we are currently doing some review to relax it a bit more, but definately not removing it,” as she pointed out that if it was not for the circuit breaker, many companies would have faced bigger losses in trading at the start of the pandemic. Last week after the listing of Dolla Financial, trading on the first day was halted by the circuit breaker rules, as the company’s stock price which listed at $1, breached the 30 per cent limit allowed on a single day, leaving many who wanted the stock and value it higher frustrated. It led to renewed calls for the JSE to do away with the circuit breaker or make changes to the rules for how much a stock price can change for a company on its first day of trading. “Could the IPO process be made to mirror the USA, where the stock price opens at the price of the first trade,” tweeted Ryan Strachan, vice-president of investor relations at GK Capital Management — the private equity and investment advisory arm of GraceKennedy. He expounded, “In other words, the list price is $1, but the first trade [price] is $1.50, so that’s where the circuit breaker should start tracking it from,” he said in reference to Dolla Financials first trade last Wednesday. Rule changes apart, Street Forrest said she is heartened to see an increase in the number of investors purchasing stocks. A decade ago, barely five per cent of the population traded stocks. Today, that number has more than doubled to 12 per cent or close to 300,000 individuals. The category of people who are enjoying the market is even more significant. “We are seeing more women coming to the market to invest. We are seeing the age group of investors falling, especially among people aged 18 years to 35 years, so you know that for the stock market the future is sound. What we want to see more of though...some of the time you find that the investor comes in for a particular issue, say a TransJam, and then you don’t see them again. They are on the books as account holders but that repeat purchase and building that portfolio, that’s where we want to go now. We want to go to the portfolio building and not just a single stock-and that would require active engagement from our broker community. It is going to require us moving that needle from the 99 companies we have listed. We have to go beyond to 200 so that people become comfortable in building portfolios.” "

                NCB Capital Markets deepening reach across region

                        ",2022-07-21,"Following the successful roll-out of its GoIPO platform in Jamaica, NCB Capital Markets Limited (NCBCM) has deployed the platform in Trinidad and Tobago ahead of First Citizens Group Financial Holdings Limited’s (FCGFH) additional public offering (APO). GoIPO was launched in January 2019 ahead of the Wigton Windfarm Limited’s initial public offering (IPO) when the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) raised $5.5 billion from the sale of its stake in the renewable energy company. It processed 4,700 applications from the 31,200 applications in that offer. The IPO was NCBCM’s litmus test for the digital platform as it eventually paved the way for the institution to exclusively arrange Mailpac Group Limited’s $495-million IPO, which was by oversubscribed 300 per cent with more than $2 billion in subscriptions. The platform also handled the TransJamaican Limited’s $14.1-billion IPO in February 2020, which had 31,624 applicants paying over $25.12 billion in subscription. While the IPO had other selling agents, the GoIPO platform was the main tool for investors to apply for the offer as no application form was included in the prospectus. “Stemming from the ‘ground-breaking’ experience in Jamaica, we intend to leverage the learnings garnered and our proven expertise in charting the kinds of innovation required to elevate the equities market regionally, beginning with the expansion of GoIPO into Trinidad & Tobago,” said Chief executive officer (CEO) of NCBCM Steven Gooden in a published release. Gooden is the chairman of NCB Merchant Bank (Trinidad and Tobago) Limited (NCBTT) which gained admission to the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange (TTSE) in June 2021. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago (GOTT) intends to sell 10,869,565 shares in FCGFH and raise TT$500 million ($11.50 billion) from the APO. This prices the unit share offer around TT$46, which is a nine per cent discount to the stock’s current price of TT$50. The GOTT owns 64.43 per cent or 161,946,890 shares in the financial group. The sale would reduce its stake to 60.11 per cent. FCGFH’s stock price is down 20 per cent year to date with a market capitalisation of TT$12.57 billion. According to Eva Mitchell, CEO, TTSE, “The introduction of GoIPO to our market is timely, given the increased interest being shown by businesses to participate in the equity capital markets. GoIPO is a platform that can be accessed by any holder of a TTCD account, providing opportunity to the wider market. In other words, it is available to the investing public regardless of broker alignment. The Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange is ripe for innovation geared towards deepening the capital markets. With global economic uncertainties, it is imperative that investors have a wide array of options to diversify their investments portfolio and that is only possible with increased access to credible opportunities.” GoIPO is the first and only digital platform in the twin-island republic which can facilitate public equity offers. Similar to Jamaica, the platform can be used by anyone with a brokerage account once NCBTT is a selling agent to the offer. This comes at a time when persons can sign up as NCBCM clients in Jamaica, Barbados, T&T or the Cayman Islands and can sign up for an account in the other respective jurisdictions using the GoIPO platform. NCBCM upgraded the platform in 2021 to allow for the biometric verification of clients’ know-your-customer (KYC) documents to make the onboarding process more simplified. When asked about the expansion of the platform’s capabilities, Gooden said, “We are continuously improving and expanding the capabilities of our digital channels and we are currently working on making fixed income offers available via our digital platforms.” NCBCM created GoIPO following the record-breaking Wisynco Group Limited IPO in December 2017 when it got more than 7,400 paper applications in a week, totalling $18.8 billion compared to the $6.1 billion target. This required the firm to work overtime and hire additional personnel to process the volume of applications in what was the largest IPO at the time. Even Wigton’s IPO saw line stretching along Knutsford Boulevard and curling around blocks as person’s went to open accounts at Jamaica Money Market Brokers Limited (JMMB). Various selling agents even detailed how staff were leaving at 2 am as they processed application forms for the offer and onboarding of clients in creating new accounts. Even lead broker Mayberry Investments Limited had to set up tents in its parking lot to accommodate the number of individuals signing up for accounts at the time. Since then, several other brokers have launched digital platforms locally such as Proven Wealth — IPOPRO; Barita Investments — Barita Boss; Sagicor Investments — eInvest; VM Wealth Management — Wealth Edge; and Mayberry Investments — MI IPO. NCBCM is currently awaiting approval from local authorities to officially launch its subsidiary NCBCM (Guyana) Inc. Apart from arranging more than $22 billion in transactions in 2022, NCBCM has also revamped its private equity service offerings to support businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, that require patient capital in this macroeconomic environment of rising interest rates and double-digit inflation. Sekou Crawford was promoted from his role as manager of origination and structuring to assistant vice-president for investment banking on March 1. As it continues to push technology as the forefront of its operations, NCBCM launched its Wealth Connect mobile application on January 1. Since then, it has added new features such as the ability to buy and sell unit trust products, transfer between NCBCM and NCB Jamaica accounts and get data such as the price to earnings and price to book ratios. NCBCM is the wealth management arm of the NCB Financial Group with the segment reporting a 18 per cent reduction in operating profit to $5.10 billion. “The feedback from our clients on the app has been positive. They have found it convenient and they value having the market data in app. They also find viewing appreciating and depreciating stock details at any time really helpful and they have indicated that the app simplifies the process of equity investing for them. Client feedback also included requests for improvements including adding new features, including allowing order cancellation and providing buy and sell queues. These are all in the backlog to be developed this year into next financial year,” Gooden closed. "

                SOS and Knutsford Express share their corporate governance journey

                        ",2022-07-21,"GOOD corporate governance structures is a requirement of companies listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE). Today, two of the Junior Market listed companies share their journey: Stationery and Office Supplies Limited (SOS) Stationery and Office Supplies Limited (SOS) is a large supplier of office and stationery equipment to corporate entities in the main, with hubs in two cities that serve markets in Jamaica and the Caribbean region. The company operates a 35,000-square-foot warehouse and showroom from its 23 Beechwood Avenue headquarters in St Andrew; and a second operation in Montego Bay, St James, spanning 3,000 square feet of space. The 50-year-old family business was founded and is led by David McDaniel and wife Marjorie McDaniel. Before listing on the Junior Market of the JSE, the two were the only shareholders, with David holding 1,400 shares and Marjorie 600 units, according to Companies Office of Jamaica records. Second-generation McDaniels are also part of the management team. In all, there are six family members assigned to various management positions, who oversee a staff of around 100. Directors shared with the Jamaica Observer in June 2022: “Prior to listing in 2017, SOS never focused on corporate governance, but since listing we have seen the immense value that corporate governance has brought to SOS as we continue to grow. Having the various governance guidelines in place now allows our staff to understand the type of company that SOS is and a clear understanding of what we expect from our employees. They said that since listing, “there are two major benefits we receive from being listed. One was exposure. As a small organisation we have received a significant amount of exposure since being listed on the JSE, which has brought in additional clientele who may never have heard of SOS previously.” Having a successful initial public offering (IPO) allowed the company to receive an influx of working capital which allowed the company an  opportunity to reinvest in the business. These additional funds, raised through the IPO, were essential as borrowing the same value through a financial institution would have continued to put a heavy strain on our cash flow as we repaid the loan. Instead we were able to focus all of our attention and finances on the continued growth of the SOS. Knutsford Express Services Limited In 2006, Oliver Townsend persuaded a group of investors to throw capital behind a dream of revolutionising the way Jamaicans moved by public transportation between the capital and the island’s major tourist resort. In the early 2000s, Townsend, an electrical engineer, had to drive from Montego Bay where he resided to Kingston multiple times each week to get to class for an MBA programme he was pursuing and had grown frustrated at not having suitable public vehicles that could allow him to study while commuting. His company, Knutsford Express, started operations on June 1, 2006 with a strong commitment to providing world-class service to persons travelling between the two major cities, Kingston and Montego Bay, including connections to the two major international airports in the island — The Sangster International Airport and the Norman Manley International Airport. With more than 20 coaches in its fleet, the company now provides connections on the south coast with stops in Savanna-la-mar, Luana, Gutters (Westmoreland) and Mandeville. On the north coast, connections can be made at the stations located in Falmouth and Ocho Rios. There are also regular scheduled connections between Kingston and Negril via both the north and south coasts. Travellers also have the opportunity to connect to St Mary and Portland from Kingston and Montego Bay through express-stops in Annotto Bay and Port Maria and from a full service station at the Errol Flynn Marina in Port Antonio. Knutsford Express Services Limited became the 22 company to list its shares on the JSE, on Wednesday, January 15, 2014. It was  the first transportation company to be listed on either the main or Junior Markets Townsend told Sunday Finance, “Strong corporate governance before being listed ensured that we could consistently deliver on our value proposition throughout all seasons and of course, create the prerequisite for being in a position to list publicly. After listing, corporate governance was further strengthened with the addition of highly experienced independent directors with decades of expertise in business, auditing, management and other areas. He added, “The ability to credibly connect with the public having been listed is perhaps most paramount. Public disclosures are invaluable. In our case, even in the advent of COVID two years ago when for a short period, our operations came to a virtual standstill, our customers and shareholders could see what we were doing.” Townsend concluded, “Pursuant to our number one guiding value of safety, we pulled our coaches off the road until we equipped them with air purifiers and put in place the necessary protocols necessary for a safe restart.  As a result, customer support has been consistently there and shareholders understand that we are in the restrengthening process necessary for a strong financial future.” "

The catalog price of one of our Airbus A220-300 aircraft is approximately €75 million. We pay a monthly lease fee to operate these aircraft. One of our Airbus aircraft can generate about 20 million euros in revenue per year if we can use it efficiently throughout the year. In the case of airBaltic, it would be almost one billion euros in 2025, but at the moment our technicians only maintain most of our ""production facilities"" because they are currently unable to bring us income,"" explains Gauss. He points out that the Destination 2025 CLEAN business plan has been adapted, which now includes the cost of the crisis and the restoration of profitability. Gauss explains that before the crisis ""airBaltic"" was on a positive growth path, but he believes that after the crisis the company will grow even stronger, because this time was used to accelerate the transformation process and fly only one type of aircraft. As Gauss explains, the investment of 250 million euros in equity capital made by the Latvian state will be returned to the Latvian state through the sale of shares in the planned initial public offering (IPO) of shares on the stock exchange. The IPO is intended not only to return the temporary help that was needed for ""airBaltic"" in the Covid-19 crisis, but it will also strengthen the capital market of Latvia, as the company plans a double listing of shares on the international stock exchange and the Nasdaq Riga stock exchange. ""In the last 25 years, airBaltic has developed into a strong, profitable and internationally recognized airline. ""airBaltic"" is Latvia's most internationally known brand, which is responsible for more than 2.5% of Latvia's gross domestic product (GDP). In order to re-establish such an airline as"" airBaltic"" and reach the same level, we would have to invest significantly more and devote several years to development. During these years, the positive impact on GDP would be significantly lower. ""airBaltic"" is a valuable asset for Latvia, which we must use and develop,"" said Gauss. According to him, every crisis ends once, and keeping this in mind, one should invest in the future. ""This year we plan to receive several more Airbus A220-300 aircraft. By the end of 2021, we will have 32 aircraft with which we will offer flights from Riga, Tallinn and Vilnius to 75 destinations in the summer season."" Forecasts for the next 12 months still call for a number of travel restrictions. Most likely, negative Covid-19 test results, Covid-19 passports or vaccination passports will be required for travel. ""We are working with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and are among the leading airlines in the world to integrate all these documents into one mobile app, thus simplifying travel for passengers in the coming months,"" says Gauss. He also states that the airline is looking forward to the time when flying will be possible again without restrictions. It also emphasizes that ""airBaltic"" was the first airline to receive a five-star rating for Covid-19 security measures. ""I would like to thank all our customers, our employees and the Latvian society for their support during this historic crisis,"" says Gauss, remembering with regret that 700 employees had to be laid off. He also says that during the pandemic, the ""airBaltic"" team was ready to resume flights with all 25 planes at any moment, and is ready for that today as well. ""Our team of over 1,000 professionals ensures that all of our aircraft are ready to get back in the air and ready to fly,"" says Gauss."

Thus, the share price has reached the lowest level at the end of the trading session since November 2013, when the company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. However, despite the fall, the value of the shares remained above the initial public offering (IPO) price of 26 dollars. Twitter's stock price has been falling since the company's executives, discussing the latest quarterly financial results last week, indicated that it will take a long time to build a service with a large number of users. Last week, ""Twitter"" announced that the company's losses in the second quarter of this year amounted to 137 million dollars, while the amount of sales increased by 61% - to more than 500 million dollars. However, the news about the slow growth of the number of users has caused new concerns among investors about the future of the company. Twitter said that the number of active users worldwide in the second quarter was 316 million, which is only two million more than in the first quarter. On the other hand, the number of users in the USA remained unchanged during this period. It has already been reported that when Twitter failed to increase the number of users, its CEO Dick Costolo resigned in June, handing power back to the company's co-founder Jack Dorsey.

ONE store scraps IPO plan due to weak investor confidence: sources,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/one-store-scraps-ipo-plan-due-to-weak-investor-confidence-sources/,"May 11, 2022",2022-07-21,"SEOUL-- ONE store Co., a South Korean mobile app market platform, decided Wednesday to withdraw its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) due to lackluster investor confidence, financial industry sources said.  The No. 2 mobile app market operator here, after Google Play store, received lackluster response from institutional investors during a two-day demand forecasting session until Tuesday, according to the sources. Institutional bids reportedly mostly fell below the company's desired pricing band between 34,300 won ($27) and 41,700 won.  ""Just this morning, ONE store considered going public by lowering the desired price, but they apparently decided to scrap the plan after concluding the company's value may not be properly recognized by the market under the current stock market situation,"" a source said.  ONE store's affiliate SK shieldus also nixed its IPO plan last week due to weak investor sentiment.  Lee Jae-hwan, CEO of ONE store, said in a press conference on Monday that the company was determined to get listed on the main bourse as planned this month, undeterred by the sister company's derailed attempt.  ONE store is the latest among several South Korean companies that have backpedaled on IPO plans so far this year. In late January, Hyundai Engineering Co., the construction arm of Hyundai Motor Group, withdrew its plan to get its stocks listed on the country's main bourse due to adverse market conditions.  ONE store logged 214 billion won in sales last year and an operating loss of 5.8 billion won. The company racked up 1.13 trillion won worth of transactions on its platform last year.  Its market share in the local mobile app market stands at some 14 percent, with Google Play's presence coming in at 71.9 percent.    Source: Yonhap News Agency  "

The listing, set for May 19, will mark the biggest ever market debut by a security service provider, more than the value of its rival firm S-1 Corp., a security firm under Samsung Group. ""Our company integrated cybersecurity and physical security services. SK shieldus should not be compared with S-1 by one-to-one,"" CEO Park Jin-hyo said at an online conference.  SK shieldus, which changed its name from ADT Caps Co. last October, currently provides security services across four main categories -- cybersecurity, convergence security, physical security, and safety and care.

SK On’s IPO unlikely to take place until after 2025: SK Innovation CEO,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/sk-ons-ipo-unlikely-to-take-place-until-after-2025-sk-innovation-ceo/,"March 31, 2022",2022-07-21,"SEOUL-- SK On Co. is not considering an initial public offering (IPO) for at least another two to three years but will build up its competitiveness and enhance corporate value before pushing for a market debut, head of its parent company said Thursday.  The potential listing of SK On has drawn attention since the battery unit was spun off from SK Innovation in October last year, as part of SK's push to bolster the battery business amid growing demand from global automakers vying for a bigger share in the electric vehicle market.  ""What's the most important for an IPO to take place is that we need to have our battery business recognized in the market,"" Kim Jun, CEO and vice chairman of SK Innovation Co., told reporters after a general shareholders meeting.  ""I expect that we should be able to deliver the performance, in terms of sales, profitability and stable management of equipment, after 2025, and I believe it would be after 2025 if we were to do an IPO,"" he said. Its bigger rival, LG Energy Solution Ltd., set a record IPO in January that made the battery maker the second-largest company in South Korea by market cap, reflecting the global electrification trend.  Kim said SK On is at the pre-IPO stage to raise funds from investors in advance of going public.  ""We need large-scale resources as we are continuing with the facility expansion ... We plan to sign the contracts (on the investments) in the first half,"" Kim said.  Industry sources predict SK On is seeking to raise between 3 and 5 trillion won (US$2.47-4.12 billion), which amounts to about a 10 percent stake in the company.  Kim forecast SK On will swing to the black in the fourth quarter of this year and achieve an annual surplus from next year. SK Innovation's battery business logged an operating loss of 683.1 billion won in the fourth quarter of last year.  In light of any possible advance into new businesses, Kim said he is looking at areas of ""non-carbon, or low-carbon energy sources,"" and discussing various ideas with SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, without elaborating further.  Earlier this month, Chey hinted at ""drawing up a new business map that incorporates energy and environment"" during a visit to a SK Innovation factory in a southwestern city.

A total of 89 companies went public in 2021 by listing stocks on the benchmark KOSPI and secondary tech-heavy KOSDAQ markets and raised a combined 19.7 trillion won (US$16.4 billion), according to the data from the Financial Supervisory Service. The money raised from IPOs represented a 333.9 percent surge from 4.5 trillion won a year earlier, the data showed. The number of companies whose shares listed on the stock markets for the first time also jumped from the previous year’s 70. The IPO market was driven by the overall rise in local stock markets and ample liquidity injected into the economy bolstered by low borrowing costs in line with record low policy rates intended to boost the pandemic-hit economy. Investors got more interested in new stock listings, with the competition ratio for IPO stocks jumping to an average of 1,136 to 1 last year, up from the 956-to-1 ratio a year earlier. The prices of newly listed stocks closed 57.4 percent higher on average on their first trading day, compared with their IPO prices. The return marked the highest in five years, the data showed. Their average prices also jumped 54.8 percent at the end of last year from the IPO prices. But of the companies that went private, 28 firms, or 31.5 percent, saw their stocks fall below the IPO prices at the end of last year, the data showed. Source: Yonhap News Agency "

									Kyobo, Affinity on blame game over IPO rejection								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220718000664&ACE_SEARCH=1,18-7-2022,2022-07-21,"
Kyobo Life Insurance headquarters in Seoul. (Kyobo Life Insurance)South Korea’s Kyobo Life Insurance and its second-largest shareholder -- a consortium led by Affinity Equity Partners -- are blaming each other for its recent failure to carry out an initial public offering. The blame game follows the nation’s sole bourse operator Korea Exchange’s decision on July 8 to reject an initial public offering by Kyobo, without citing a reason. Market watchers, however, cited Kyobo’s yearslong legal dispute with the consortium led by the Hong Kong-based private equity firm behind the KRX’s latest move. “Our IPO plan was canceled because of Affinity’s disruption,” Kyobo said in a statement released Friday. “Affinity must cooperate as two-thirds of our shareholders have agreed with our IPO plan,” it added. As of end-2021, Kyobo CEO Shin Chang-jae and related parties stood as the insurer’s largest shareholder with 36.91 percent, while the consortium led by Affinity held a 9.05 percent stake, making it the second-largest shareholder. Other notable shareholders include Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan with a 7.62 percent stake, the Korea Export-Import Bank with 5.85 percent and a consortium led by local private equity firm IMM PE with 5.23 percent. Affinity refused to back down and released a statement on the same day saying that, “All faults and responsibilities for Kyobo’s IPO failure is with its CEO Shin who has failed to uphold his side of the bargain among shareholders.”At the core of the dispute lies Kyobo and Affinity’s failure to get on the same page about the insurer’s IPO price. Kyobo has expressed its desire to set its IPO price based on the current market conditions, while Affinity has been calling for the price to be set at 409,912 won ($311.41) per share based on the put option agreement signed with the Korean insurer in 2012. The consortium claims that the 2012 put option contract obligates Shin to buy out its shares unless he had succeeded in floating the company by 2015. But no initial public offering has yet to take place. In October 2018, the consortium exercised the option. But Shin refused to buy out the shares, citing the exorbitant price of 409,912 won per share. The International Chamber of Commerce intervened at the group’s request, but the two parties have yet to settle their differences. A tribunal, which has already said the contract itself remains valid, is now asked to rule on how the two should set the price, though the decision is not expected anytime soon.Kyobo Life had been seeking to complete an IPO within the first half of this year to diversify its funding sources to brace for the adoption of a new accounting rule for insurance products here in 2023. Its second IPO application was filed in December.(mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

									Kakao Mobility at crossroads amid sell-off rumors								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220710000080&ACE_SEARCH=1,10-7-2022,2022-07-21,"
A couple of taxis using Kakao Mobility’s ride-hailing service Kakao T wait for passengers in front of Seoul station on June 28. (Yonhap)A dispute between Kakao Corp. management and its labor union is growing over the IT giant’s rumored attempt to sell its transportation service subsidiary Kakao Mobility to private equity firm MBK Partners. Kakao’s labor union on Wednesday accused the management of giving up on its mobility business, questioning if the sell-off to the private equity fund can help the business grow.According to the union’s statement, Kakao Corp. said its mobility platform cannot grow anymore under its wing, and that the IT giant has no intention of continuing with the mobility business. It added that Kakao’s management said the sale was necessary for the business to expand. The union sees the sale of Kakao Mobility as an attempt to prevent Kakao founder Kim Beom-su from being asked to appear at the National Assembly’s state audit this year. It said it would resume collecting signatures from Kakao Corp. employees for a petition, which was launched in June when rumors of a sale first began swirling, to oppose the deal. Shortly after the union’s statement was released, Bae Jae-hyun, the company’s chief investment officer, downplayed the sale rumors. He said in an internal notice that the company has never considered an entire sell-off.“What we are considering is changing Kakao’s stake in (Kakao Mobility) to become the second-largest shareholder by selling (a 10-19 percent stake),” he said. This suggests MBK would also buy shares from other owners to become the largest shareholder. Kakao Corp. owns a 57.5 percent stake in Kakao Mobility while a consortium led by US private equity firm TPG holds a 29 percent stake and the Carlyle Group has a 6.2 percent stake.The CIO added that the company is contemplating how Kakao Mobility can grow bigger beyond Kakao Corp.’s boundaries, saying no decisions had been made. The union last month met with the IT giant’s leadership including Kim Sung-su, chairman of the board of directors, to oppose the sale.Kakao Mobility went into turmoil after June 14 when it was reported that MBK Partners -- one of the largest private equity firms in Asia -- was in talks with the IT giant to buy a 40 percent stake in Kakao Mobility, which was valued at 8.5 trillion won ($6.6 billion).   Despite Kakao Corp.’s explanation that nothing was decided at the time, the sudden news sparked outcry from employees, as the company even had picked underwriters in March to go public on the Korea Exchange this year. Kakao’s labor union then began collecting signatures of employees and staged protests to oppose the sale of Kakao Mobility. The union denounced Kakao Corp.’s leadership for reneging on its promise to undergo an initial public offering. Previous IPOs of Kakao subsidiaries have included stock options for employees.Prospects of a stock listing have faded due to weak market conditions and damage to the corporation’s image after Kakao Pay executives dumped shares in the company in December last year. The executives, including Ryu Young-joon, CEO of Kakao Corp.’s mobile payment unit, exercised their stock options to sell company shares only a month after Kakao Pay’s listing, reaping a windfall of almost 90 billion won.“Kakao pulled out the sell-off card just three months after it had vowed to carry out shareholder-friendly policies. Isn’t the company trying to retrieve its investment in a different way as the option of going public is likely blocked?” said the union. A staffer at one of Kakao Corp.’s subsidiaries told The Korea Herald that Kakao Mobility employees have been feeling “uneasy” as the direction of the company is now unclear. “We don’t know too much about what’s going on with the rumored sell-off. We just hope things become clear soon,” said the staffer who requested anonymity. Kakao Corp. is under pressure to resolve things one way or another, as an IPO this year was among the conditions of the minority shareholders’ investments in Kakao Mobility. It is almost certain that there would be penalty clauses for failing to list, such as a requirement to buy back shares at an elevated price or to engage in a joint sale to a third party.But with the stock market in freefall, MBK Partners will be in no hurry to complete the acquisition, according to an analyst at a local private equity firm. “The value of technology stocks has decreased, so I think it is unlikely (for MBK Partners) to buy (Kakao Mobility) at the value of 8.5 trillion won. MBK Partners has no reason to go for that price at the moment,” he said. The analyst noted that MBK Partners will also consider tag-along rights of TPG and the Carlyle Group during negotiations with Kakao Corp. Tag-along rights allow minority shareholders to sell their shares if a majority shareholder is negotiating a stake sale. If MBK Partners were to acquire a 40 percent stake from Kakao Corp. as well as all shares owned by TPG and the Carlyle Group, it would approximately cost 6.4 trillion won. “Such a large deal could put some burden on MBK Partners, so won’t they try to push the price further down?” the analyst said. Since the second half of last year, Kakao Mobility has been under fire for hiking ride-hailing fees and expanding into new business areas to provide designated driver services, quick delivery and parcel delivery. The mobility application operator faced heat from the public as its expanded services drove small merchants and business owners out of work.  An IT industry source told The Korea Herald that the sale of Kakao Mobility could give Kakao Corp. some breathing room. “Kakao’s public image has worsened over the past year and Kakao Mobility was one of the major reasons behind that. So I think Kakao might want to detach itself from the mobility business. If a deal is made, it would give Kakao instant cash,” the source said. After Kakao Mobility began as a spinoff subsidiary from Kakao Corp. in 2017, it quickly became the country’s largest mobility platform service provider. Kakao Mobility has 30 million cumulative users and 10 million monthly active users, as of July.The company recorded annual sales of 546 billion won last year, almost doubling from 2020, and posted operating profits of 12.5 billion won to be in the black for the first time.By Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)

									[Newsmaker] Internet-only banks lure customers with Tamagotchi-like savings accounts, digital piggy banks								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220701000469&ACE_SEARCH=1,1-7-2022,2022-07-21,"
Advertisement for Toss Bank`s savings account(Toss Bank)Saving money is never fun. But when combined with a digital pet that grows alongside the size of your savings, it can be more motivating. South Korea’s three internet-only banks -- KakaoBank, K bank and Toss Bank -- have launched unique products such as Tamagotchi-like savings accounts, mobile joint accounts and digital piggy banks to lure customers attracted to the trends. Toss Bank, launched in October last year, has registered 3.6 million users in just eight months through a slew of unique savings products and digital-friendly services. One of them is a Tamagotchi-like savings account in which a user can see a randomly selected digital pet -- turtle, octopus, colt or ghost -- grow with deposits for six months. The digital pet idea has been met with booming demand, as Toss opened 100,000 new accounts within 72 hours of its launch on June 14. Users can deposit a maximum 1 million won ($773) per month for a total of six months with a yield of 3 percent. “The act of saving money requires time and patience, and we wanted to change that time into a fun experience of raising a cute pet for our users,” Toss Bank CEO Hong Min-take told reporters at a media event in Seoul on Tuesday. Toss Bank also plans to launch a joint mobile account “soon,” Hong added, which will cater to friends and groups seeking to split the bill for their favorite activities. The nation’s No. 1 internet-only bank by users, KakaoBank -- with 19.13 million users -- has rolled out various accounts and services tied to its sister company and top mobile messenger KakaoTalk. In this sense, 11.39 million users had opened one of its joint accounts as of May. KakaoTalk currently has some 45 million monthly active users in a country of about 51 million.Its short-term 26-week savings account, a rare product here, was met with high demand upon its launch on June 21, registering 150,000 new accounts within 72 hours. The bank’s piggy bank services are also a key product, allowing users to make deposits of less than 1,000 won on its mobile account daily. The bank managed some 4.35 million piggy bank accounts as of the end of April. K bank is somewhat behind its two rivals in providing unique services, but it is the only mobile bank here providing a real-name account for cryptocurrency trading. Its partnership with local crypto exchange Upbit, signed in June 2020, has helped more than triple its users from 2.19 million in 2020 to some 7 million as of end-2021. K bank’s initial public offering plans, which have been stalled for years, have been gaining pace with the firm filing for a preliminary review for listing on the Korean market with the Korea Exchange on Thursday. Its IPO is predicted to be valued at at least 6 trillion won and the firm is forecast to debut in November, according to market watchers. Korea’s internet-only banks have been expanding quickly in recent years, backed by an increase in the use of smartphones and keeping traditional lenders on their toes with user-friendly services. KakaoBank’s earnings jumped about 80 percent on-year in 2021, with net income amounting to 204.12 billion won, according to a regulatory filing. Operating profit more than doubled over the cited period to 256.94 billion won, and sales also expanded 32.4 percent on-year to 1.06 trillion won.K bank recorded a net profit of 22.4 billion won last year, swinging into the black from a net loss of 105.4 billion won the previous year. Toss Bank, being relatively new to the market, has yet to release its earnings. Its total loans stood at some 4 trillion won as of last month, with 36 percent being taken out by low- and mid-rated customers.(mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

									Kakao Pay employees each lose W20m over stock dip								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220612000131&ACE_SEARCH=1,12-6-2022,2022-07-21,"
(Kakao Pay)Kakao Pay employees who own shares in their own company each lost an average 20 million won ($15,600) due to the mobile payment firm’s stock price plunge since January, reports said Sunday. The company’s employee stock ownership association purchased a total 3.4 million shares in Kakao Pay at the price of 90,000 won per share prior to its initial public offering on Nov. 3 last year, according to a regulatory filing. Documents show that some 800 employees received an average 4,005 shares each, valued at 360.4 million won at the time of the firm’s market debut. It had set the IPO price at 90,000 won per share, opened at the price of 180,000 won and closed higher at 193,000 won on its first day.But Kakao Pay employees have each lost some 20 million won after the company’s share price plunged over a slew of risks since January, the reports said. The mobile payment operator hit a 52-week-low in terms of closing price on Friday with 85,100, closing 3.73 percent lower from the previous session.Kakao Pay shares lost its rally after it was found in January that former CEO Ryu Young-joon and seven other executives offloaded 90 billion won of company shares by exercising stock option in December, only a month after the company went public. Furthermore, the firm’s second-largest shareholder Alipay dumped 5 million shares -- about 10 percent of the total stake it holds in Kakao Pay -- in a block deal, sending the payment platform operator’s price down 15.57 percent from the previous closing to 89,500 won on Wednesday. Alipay remains the second-largest shareholder, with a 34.72 percent stake in the Korean firm. Members of Kakao Pay’s employee stock ownership association are legally obligated to keep their shares until Nov. 3 this year, a year since the firm’s IPO launch. (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

									[Market Eye] Kakao share prices stall as company struggles to regain public trust								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220608000878&ACE_SEARCH=1,8-6-2022,2022-07-21,"
Graphs showing the change in stock price for Kakao, Kakao Pay and KakaoBank (The Korea Herald)Kakao Pay shares tumbled Wednesday morning after it was reported that its second-largest shareholder Alipay was looking to sell 5 million shares -- about 10 percent of the total stake it holds in Kakao Pay -- in a block deal. The stock price of Kakao Pay fell 15.57 percent to close at 89,500 won. Despite the sell-off, the payment arm of IT giant Kakao said Alipay will continue to be a strategic investor and remain the second-largest shareholder, with 34.72 percent of Kakao Pay shares, and the two sides will carry on with their strong partnership. Experts, however, said this could be the beginning of an ugly turn of events. An analyst at a local securities firm told The Korea Herald that the risk of overhang remains with Alipay’s block deal. “Alipay holds a lot more Kakao Pay shares, so it could sell some of the remaining amount or more. This possibility of dumping off shares has a negative impact for other shareholders as it was seen in today’s price drop,” the analyst said. Park Sang-hyun, an insight provider at independent investment research network Smartkarma, pointed out that Alipay’s return on its Kakao Pay investment is 10 times, so it may be natural to realize a profit to some extent. “But the local market believes that the strategic partnership is cracking, starting with this stake sale. It is highly likely that Alipay will go through a multiphased stake sale process,” Park added. The sharp drop in Kakao Pay’s stock price marked the latest hiccup in a series of disappointments for Kakao Group in the past nine months.In June 2021, Kakao Group became South Korea’s fifth-largest business group in terms of market capitalization at 79.3 trillion won ($65.1 billion), behind the country’s traditional conglomerates: Samsung, SK, LG and Hyundai Motor Group. About a month later, Kakao founder Kim Beom-su was ranked as the richest person in the country by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His net worth was estimated at $13.4 billion. The report said Kim was an exemplary case of how a self-made entrepreneur could succeed in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, which has long been dominated by its family-controlled conglomerates.The tech giant, which rose to prominence with its messenger app KakaoTalk, climbed up the ladder through aggressive expansion of businesses. At the end of the first half of 2021, Kakao had over 150 subsidiaries and affiliates in and out of the country. However, the platform behemoth’s heyday did not last long. The company -- once touted for the legendary tale of its self-made entrepreneur founder and the success of technological innovation in the 21st century -- has undergone a series of blunders and setbacks in recent months. In September, Kakao’s people-friendly image first faced criticism over the company’s rapid expansion, said to have driven small merchants out of business. That led to Kakao’s pledge to pull back some of the company’s services in industries such as snacks and flower delivery.To avert public criticism, Kakao vowed to create a fund of 300 billion won to support small firms and the self-employed, but its misfortunes continued.In the same month, the founder’s investment company K Cube Holdings -- the de facto holding company of Kakao -- was accused of having private interests as well as the illegal succession of family members in employment. More allegations piled on, as K Cube Holdings was accused of fabricating regulatory documents.Kim later apologized at a National Assembly state audit, saying the investment company would change to be committed to social responsibilities.A series of megasized initial public offering deals that further raised Kakao’s market profile, ironically, exposed the root cause for its downfall.A mass sale of Kakao Pay shares by executives including Ryu Young-joon, the then-appointee for Kakao’s next co-CEO, struck the company hard in January.Ryu, who was CEO of Kakao’s mobile payment unit Kakao Pay, was found to have exercised his stock option to sell company shares in December, only a month after the company’s listing. Through this, he and several senior executives collected a total profit of almost 90 billion won, with Ryu taking about half of the gains. Kakao saw fierce backlash from the company’s labor union, retail investors and the general public as the executives raked in massive profits at the expense of investors. Combined with the group’s hasty expansion that had hit small businesses last year, the irresponsible money-making decision raised concerns over whether the IT group could maintain accountable corporate governance. Kakao released an apology, vowing to ban CEOs and executives at its subsidiaries from selling company shares within one to two years after being listed on the market through setting up a new control tower. In March, Kim resigned from his chairman post of the board of directors, leaving behind ailing stock prices and loss of trust among investors.   Kakao’s stock price, which hit as high as 169,500 won per share at the close of June 23, 2021, has halved to a little over 80,000 won per share almost a year later. The stock prices of Kakao Pay and KakaoBank have also suffered similar or worse downfalls, losing trillions of won in the process. On top of losing confidence from the market, the IT giant has irked its own crew.Last week, Kakao unveiled its new “metaverse” working system where employees could basically work wherever they want. The seemingly future-oriented scheme, however, was met with internal resistance from employees, as the new system would require being connected online through a voice channel at all times. Kakao workers expressed concerns and discontent on an in-house online community space, saying the new policy was as an attempt to spy on employees. Kakao CEO Namkoong Whon later said in an announcement to staff that being connected to the voice channel would be decided by crew members in different groups or work areas, but did not scrap the plan. Regarding the implementation of a mandatory working time from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., he said the company will reconsider the plan through communication with staff. Without working on mending ties with stakeholders in and out of the company, Kakao instead unveiled its new vision, “Kakao Universe,” on Tuesday, saying it wants to go beyond Korea. The CEO said they will look to reach 5 billion people across the world through open links that connect them based on their interests instead of targeting South Korea’s 50 million domestic users. But if Kakao cannot redeem itself as the people-friendly company it once was with the rise of its dominant messenger app, experts say it will be difficult for the company to win back people’s hearts and bounce back. “I think Kakao’s stock prices are not doing well due to its subsidiaries going public. Naver has only one entity in the bourse, but Kakao’s other firms have been listed and this has cemented Kakao’s image as a firm that conducts (IPOs) to sell shares to make money,” an analyst at a local private equity firm told The Korea Herald. “Kakao’s growth has been done through mergers and acquisitions, as well as some unethical moves such as taking the business of small merchants. Its corporate governance is also seemingly abominable,” he added.By Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)

									E-book platform Millie’s Library to go public by end of 2022								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220529000158&ACE_SEARCH=1,29-5-2022,2022-07-21,"
Corporate logo of Millie’s Library (Millie’s Library)Millie’s Library, one of South Korea’s largest e-book subscription platform, said Sunday that it is set for a market debut by the end of this year.The company filed a preliminary prospectus on Friday stating that it will offer 2 million common shares out of the total 8,234,901 shares. If the initial public offering process goes as planned, it will be the country’s first e-book platform to go public.Its shares are poised to start trading on the Korea Exchange’s secondary Kosdaq. The lead manager of the envisioned IPO is Mirae Asset Securities.The corporate value of Millie’s Library is estimated to be around 300 billion won ($239 million), according to market insiders.With funds raised from the IPO, the company plans to invest in the production of original book content as well as other content.The company’s sales revenue surged on-year by 61 percent to 28.9 billion won last year. However, it posted an operating loss of 34.8 billion won, and has still not turned a profit.Millie’s Library has been seeking to accelerate growth momentum after it was acquired by Genie Music, the music streaming platform under KT, in 2021. Genie Music currently holds 39 percent of the shares of the company.Working with the KT artificial intelligence business unit, the e-book platform plans to create synergy with an AI-based audio platform to produce more content, including audiobooks.Last year, Seo Young-taek, CEO of Millie’s Library, said if the company’s intellectual property-based business model is well received, its value will exceed the 500 billion won of Radish, the US webtoon platform acquired by Kakao Entertainment. In the long term, the company looks to achieve more than 1 trillion won in value, Seo added.But concerns loom over the e-book platform’s debut amid a lackluster IPO market and an ongoing slump in platform giants such as Naver and Kakao, industry sources said. Naver’s stock price has traded below 300,000 won since late April, while Kakao is also showing sluggish movement between 80,000 and 90,000 won in the citied period.“The company has grown exponentially to become the country’s largest online library platform in just six years. Based on our vision -- ‘become friends with an unlimited number of books’ -- we will expand the presence in the book content market,” Seo said in a statement. Launched in 2017, Millie’s Library services 110,000 e-books through 1,400 publishers as of May. The company is the first here to provide an e-book subscription service. It produces audiobooks, “chat books,” which are books re-created in a chatting format, and audio dramas.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

									Taiwan’s Fubon Financial becomes third-largest shareholder in Hyundai Card								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220520000488&ACE_SEARCH=1,20-5-2022,2022-07-21,"
Hyundai Card headquarters in Seoul (Hyundai Card)Taiwanese banking giant Fubon Financial on Friday raised its stake in South Korea’s Hyundai Card to nearly 20 percent, expanding its clout over management of the card issuer. Fubon Financial is now the card issuer’s third-largest shareholder with 19.98 percent after Hyundai Motor with 36.96 percent and Hyundai Commercial with 28.56 percent. Kia Corp. is the fourth-largest stakeholder with 11.48 percent. The latest announcement puts a final stamp on the exit of a consortium led by Hong Kong-based private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners from the card issuer, which previously owned a 24 percent threshold. Since last year, Affinity had sold its some 20 percent stake to Fubon Financial’s commercial banking unit Fubon Bank and life insurer Fubon Life Insurance for roughly 520 billion won ($409 million). The remaining 4 percent stake was sold to Hyundai Commercial. The move comes four years after the consortium bought the same number of shares for 380 billion won. It also effectively nullifies the Affinity’s initial request made in 2017 for Hyundai Card to complete its initial public offering within four years of the stake purchase, indefinitely delaying the possible listing. “There are no immediate plans for an IPO,” Hyundai Card said in a statement in the day. Early this year, Hyundai Card’s two outside directors from Affinity left their posts to be replaced by Douglas Tsai, management associate at Fubon Financial Holding. The company is expected to fill the vacant post with another Fubon official. “Fubon Financial has highly regarded Hyundai Card’s potential to further grow as a private label credit card issuer alongside our data science and branding skills as our strategic investor,” the card issuer said in a statement. A private label credit card is a credit card that offers more benefits for use at a specific brand‘s stores. Fubon Financial was founded in 1961 with multiple subsidiaries including Fubon Life, Taipei Fubon Bank, Fubon Securities, Fubon Asset Management and more. As of the end of 2021, Fubon Financial Holdings had unaudited net assets of $10.51 trillion. At the end of 2015, Fubon Life purchased a 48 percent stake in Hyundai Life Insurance, to rebrand it as Fubon Hyundai Life.Hyundai Card’s net profit in the first three months of this year declined 4 percent on-year to 76.9 billion won, according to regulatory filing.By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

									One Store pulls IPO plan, SK Square pressured to change course								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220511000885&ACE_SEARCH=1,11-5-2022,2022-07-21,"
A promotional image of One Store app store (One Store)South Korea’s homegrown mobile app store operator One Store has dropped its plan to go public amid poor stock market conditions, the company said Wednesday.One Store’s decision comes a day after a book building of institutional investors wrapped up, in which the offering price of a common share was below its suggested price band, at between 34,300 won ($26.9) and 41,700 won apiece. The figures have estimated One Store’s equity value at between 910 billion won and 1.1 trillion won. The decision came in contrast with the company officials’ pledge to proceed with the IPO at all costs, as expressed in a press conference Monday. Officials including Chief Executive Officer Lee Jae-hwan touted One Store as a challenger in the app store market globally dominated by Google and Apple. One Store said in a statement the decision is attributable to “heightening macroeconomic uncertainties that sapped investor sentiment in the stock market,” despite “positive feedback on the company fundamentals” by institutional investors.One Store’s announcement marks the sixth of its kind, following companies including its sister company SK Shieldus and corrugated cardboard maker Tailim Paper.One Store’s shareholders include Korean internet giant Naver, US tech giant Microsoft and Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, in addition to SK Square.Accordingly, its parent SK Square is pressured to change courses from its plan to enhance corporate value through a soft landing of its subsidiaries on the stock market. SK Shieldus, a security services subsidiary of the investment body, also withdrew its bid to go public on Friday. The decision, combined with One Store’s case, is casting a shadow on SK Square’s plan to list more subsidiaries including e-commerce arm 11st. SK Square’s share price hit yet another all-time low. Its shares fell 3.25 percent Wednesday. The market cap of SK Square nearly halved to 6.3 trillion won from the highest point in late November, as soon as the company was spun off from Korea’s largest mobile carrier SK Telecom.

									Yoon likely to expand loan support for ‘vulnerable’ groups								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220511000747&ACE_SEARCH=1,11-5-2022,2022-07-21,"
President Yoon Suk-yeol at the National Assembly. (Yonhap)The Yoon Suk-yeol government is looking to make it easier for “vulnerable groups” to take out loans to follow through on his campaign promise, while offering better protection to consumers from predatory lending and unfair corporate practices.The groups refer to self-employed people, small business owners, first-time home buyers and those fresh out of college who the government says need more financial support than all the others. COVID fallout and runaway housing prices have put them in greater focus.“We have yet to receive a clear directive on details but given what’s been said so far, we expect expanding support for the financially challenged groups,” an official at the Financial Services Commission said.The official was referring to Yoon’s “Target 110,” an agenda laying out 110 goals Yoon has given priority. Yoon’s office revealed it last week ahead of Yoon’s swearing in on Tuesday.Financial authorities are preparing concrete steps, such as offering more favorable interest rates, rolling over maturing loans and reducing debts for the self-employed and small businesses to help them recoup losses caused by COVID-19.For first-time home buyers and those seeking to open and expand their savings account from their first job, the government is considering partially easing a long set of mortgage rules and allowing more favorable terms on the savings accounts.Meanwhile, the Yoon government is expected to put a greater check on banks seeking to inflate interest rates -- a complaint consumers have long filed with authorities.Financial services companies would also face a higher burden of proof for any security breaches that violate consumers’ interests, according to authorities. Banks have long been accused of shifting the burden of proof to consumers or regulators to reduce damages to pay.Authorities added that they will deal with unfair corporate practices, referring to a contentious spinoff LG Chem carried out and the stock options row at Kakao Pay, which all took place in January this year.Individual investors holding shares in LG Chem, which wholly owned LG Energy Solution before the world’s second-largest battery maker went public in what was Korea’s record listing, cried foul over the lack of regulation for what they saw as a corporate practice that unfairly diluted their share value. A similar spinoff also took place to float Kakao Pay, a payment arm of Korea’s leading chat app operator Kakao Corp., which is one of the two internet giants along with Naver.But it was a stock price fall that brought down the CEO at Kakao Pay, where the senior management including the CEO exercised stock options a month after the initial public offering, causing what investors called an “unwarranted dip” in stock prices. The bourse operator have had to roll out rules to oversee spinoff IPOs done by large-cap companies and lockup periods on executives looking to offload shares following an IPO, when shares could potentially run higher than expected on investor optimism. Such rule change is one of many to come to level the playing field for consumers, authorities said.By Choi Si-young (siyoungchoi@heraldcorp.com)

									One Store out to challenge Google, Apple app store monopolies with IPO								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220509000666&ACE_SEARCH=1,9-5-2022,2022-07-21,"
One Store CEO Lee Jae-hwan delivers a presentation at a press conference in Seoul, Monday. (One Store)South Korea’s homegrown app marketplace One Store aims to challenge Google and Apple, two US tech giants that enjoy a near-monopoly in the whopping 300 trillion won ($235 billion) app store market globally, with its forthcoming stock market debut here. One Store, the nation’s sole operator of an app store of the same name, is a merged entity of the nation’s four app stores that was previously operated separately by SK Telecom, KT, LG Uplus and Naver. Now it is an affiliate of SK Square, SK Group’s investment unit.In its push for global expansion, it plans to secure a footing first in Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan by the end of this year, and then Europe and North America in the long run. “Korea is the only app store market in the world which made its way out of an app store monopoly,” One Store Chief Executive Officer Lee Jae-hwan told a news conference in Seoul Monday. “To the global market, One Store is close to being among the only options, given the time and cost it takes for a country to create a new app store from scratch.”Lee cited an estimate by IGAWorks Mobile Index that showed One Store beat Apple with 13.8 percent of market share in 2021 and trailed just behind Google. The company also estimated the total transactions on its marketplace at 1.13 trillion won through 2021, exceeding the 1 trillion won per year mark for the first time. Moreover, One Store will benefit from the world’s efforts to break the app store monopoly and its own localization efforts. There are bills pending designed to curtail tech giants’ monopolistic behavior, such as the Open App Markets Act in the United States and the Digital Market Act in the European Union. These bills are expected to open up a new opportunity to the Korean marketplace, dedicated to mobile gaming apps, media content like webtoons and gaming gear, Lee said.Also, One Store charges customers lower commission fees for users compared with Google and Apple at home. The same policy will be applied to the overseas market, according to Lee. Moreover, One Store will support a wider range of payment options including vouchers, bank-to-bank transfers and prepaid cards. “We are seeing a strong pressure worldwide to open the doors to new app store operators, and we expect the entry barrier to disappear by late this year or early next year,” Lee said. Part of the cost for its overseas expansion will come from its initial public offering later this month, which could fetch up to 277.7 billion won. Immediately after the IPO, its market cap is expected to stand at up to 1.1 trillion won. This comes despite the unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and investors’ resulting flight to safety that have weighed down on the stock market. Its sister company SK Shieldus, a cybersecurity service company, withdrew from its bid to offer shares to the public on Friday. The company cited “jittery” market sentiment as its book building drew lackluster attention from institutional investors, reeling from macroeconomic concerns such as Russia‘s invasion of Ukraine and the US interest rate hike to fight inflation.Both SK Shieldus and One Store are controlled by SK Square, a carveout of Korea’s largest mobile carrier SK Telecom. SK Square’s share price hit an all-time low as it fell 5.3 percent on Monday. A One Store official said the company will go on to proceed with the IPO at all costs, considering the low IPO price at nearly the purchase price set in a $15 million equity investment by Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, a joint investment body by Microsoft and Deutsche Telekom.“We think it is the right timing to do the IPO. If we don’t we are losing the opportunity to grow our global presence,” One Store Chief Financial Officer Kim Sang-don said. One Store has never been in the black since it was founded in 2016. The company in 2021 recorded a 5.8 billion won operating loss, up over fivefold in a year. Kim anticipated a turnaround in 2022 with some 5 billion won operating profit.(consnow@heraldcorp.com)

US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference in Washington on May 4. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised the benchmark lending rate by a half percentage point in its ongoing effort to contain the highest inflation in four decades. (AFP)The US Federal Reserve’s biggest rate hike in 22 years poses a dilemma for South Korea’s central bank in adjusting the pace of its monetary tightening and for local businesses seeking to go public, experts said Friday.The Fed’s decision to raise its base rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday (Eastern Standard Time) that set its target federal funds rate to a range between 0.75 percent and 1 percent has presented new hurdles for the Bank of Korea, which is wary of the growing risks tied to capital outflow and a strong dollar trend. In the past, a higher base interest rate in the US has led to a weakening of the Korean won and capital outflow. Recently-appointed BOK Gov. Rhee Chang-yong expressed concerns last month that the higher US base rate could result in higher inflationary pressure here due to the won’s weakening. JP Morgan said in its Wednesday note that it noted a more hawkish-than-expected tone in the BOK’s April monetary policy meeting minutes, indicating the central bank is considering adopting a faster-than-expected monetary tightening timeline. “The minutes bolstered the risk case of a higher terminal rate than our previous expectation of 2.25 percent that we highlighted in our previous note,” the note said. The global banking group now forecast the BOK’s base rate to be raised to 2.5 percent by the end of the year. However, the BOK is also trying to hit the brakes on snowballing household debt, and a higher benchmark interest rate would lead to a heavier burden on debt repayment for households. “The BOK could take a ‘big step’ in May and July under the scenario of healthy exports and consumer spending, but it’s not that easy for them at the moment,” Joo Won, a senior economist at the Hyundai Research Institute said.“The household debt, which has increased to 1.862 quadrillion won ($1.46 trillion) as of end-2021, and risks that lead to an economic recession poses as major hurdles,” he added. The BOK’s benchmark interest rate currently stands at 1.5 percent after its policy board voted to a quarter percentage point rate hike last month. It marked the central bank’s fourth pandemic-era rate hike, after it ended more than a year of a record-low interest rate in August last year. The BOK’s next monetary policy board meeting is scheduled for May 26.Alongside the BOK, the Korean stock market was hit by the Fed’s latest move. SK shieldus, the cybersecurity arm of South Korean telecom giant SK Telecom, reportedly scrapped its plans for an initial public offering amid increased market volatilities due to the Fed’s “big step” rate hike. The firm received a lukewarm response from domestic and foreign institutional investors during a two-day demand forecasting session held Tuesday and Wednesday, dampening its original plan to raise up to 3.55 trillion won through its IPO initially scheduled for May 19. While volatilities are likely to continue, some analysts say that the local market has already absorbed the risks stemming from the Fed’s monetary tightening, painting a rosier-than-expected picture. “The market has preemptively absorbed the risks stemming from the US Fed’s hawkish moves, and the assessment of our stocks have fallen to the level during the 2008 financial crisis,” Samsung Securities analyst Jeong Myung-ji said.“Excluding stocks that are more vulnerable towards interest rates, the effects of the US Fed’s rate hikes on the Korean stock market are likely to be weak,” Jeong added.Korea’s benchmark Kospi closed 1.23 percent lower from the previous session at 2,644.51 on Friday, with foreigners offloading 357.9 billion won.By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

									SK Shieldus withdraws IPO on jittery market sentiment								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220506000479&ACE_SEARCH=1,6-5-2022,2022-07-21,"
The corporate logo of SK Shieldus (SK Shieldus)SK Shieldus, the South Korean security service subsidiary of SK Group’s ICT arm SK Square, said on Friday that it has scrapped its plans for market debut, citing dampened investor sentiment.“We have submitted a delisting notice to the Financial Supervisory Service because the recent demand forecasting, which decides initial public offering prices, showed that our corporate value may not be well received,” the company said.Stressing that market sentiment has turned sour following global economic uncertainties, the company added it will restart the IPO process when market conditions improve.But Industry insiders say the sluggish demand for SK Shieldus’ IPO comes as the company’s corporate value is said to be overrated. The company was aiming to attract up to 3.55 trillion won ($2.79 billion) through the IPO, which was slated for May 19.In the course of calculating its IPO price, the company compared average stock prices of local security service providers like S-1 Corp., Taiwan Secom Co., AhnLab and Cyberone.However, AhnLab, the IT security firm founded by Ahn Cheol-soo -- the leader of the transition committee for President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol -- had seen an unusual spike in its stock price during March. Before logging a record high of 218,500 won, the stock price has averaged around only 70,000 won. If AhnLab had been eliminated from the calculation, the IPO price of SK Shieldus couldn’t have been that high, sources said.“Although SK Shieldus lags behind S-1, a bellwether security firm, in both sales revenue and profit, the company had sought to raise even higher market cap than the rival,” said Choi Nam-gon, researcher at Yuanta Securities, in a report.Choi added that of the 27.1 million shares the company aims to float, almost half of them will go to Blue Security Investment -- a special purpose company of Macquarie Finance Korea and the second largest shareholder -- since it is selling some of the existing shares to the public in order to cash them.Sources say SK Shieldus’ sudden withdrawal of IPO may have a negative impact on the market debut of SK Square’s other affiliate, One Store. The mobile app marketplace operator plans to go public later this year.Meanwhile, SK Shieldus became the first SK Group affiliate to have failed in making mega-sized deals like those made by SK Biopharmaceuticals, SK Bioscience, SK IE Technology Co. and SK REIT.SK Shieldus, formerly known as ADT Caps, changed its name in October last year, seeking to transform into a comprehensive life care platform. The company currently provides services on cybersecurity, convergence security, physical security, and safety and care in both real world and virtual communities. Last November, the company was spun off from Korea’s largest telecom carrier SK Telecom.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

SK Shieldus CEO Park Jin-hyo speaks at a virtual press conference in Seoul on Tuesday. (SK Shieldus)South Korean cybersecurity service provider SK shieldus Co. withdrew its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) Friday, citing lackluster investor confidence.SK shieldus, the cybersecurity arm of South Korean telecom giant SK Telecom Co., said it had submitted a delisting notice to the Financial Supervisory Service the same day, about a month after reporting an IPO plan in late March.The decision came as the company received lackluster response from domestic and foreign institutional investors during a two-day demand forecasting session Tuesday through Wednesday amid growing uncertainty over the global economy.""SK shieldus decided to shelve its listing, as demand forecasting for the final IPO price showed its corporate value may not be assessed in a proper way,"" the company said in a statement.After factoring in market conditions down the road, SK shieldus will again push for an IPO at an appropriate time when the company is capable of receiving proper assessment from investors, it added.SK shieldus had sought to raise up to 3.55 trillion won ($2.79 billion) through the IPO originally slated for May 19, in what could have been the biggest ever market debut by a local security service provider.SK shieldus, which changed its name from ADT Caps Co. last October, currently provides security services across four main categories -- cybersecurity, convergence security, physical security, and safety and care.Last year, the company chalked off 1.55 trillion won in sales, trailing its rival S-1 Corp. under South Korea's top conglomerate Samsung Group, whose top line came to 2.31 trillion won.SK shieldus is the fourth South Korean company that has backpedaled on IPO plans so far this year. In late January, Hyundai Engineering Co., the construction arm of Hyundai Motor Group, withdrew its plan to get its stocks listed on the country's main bourse due to adverse market conditions.In mid-March, Voronoi Inc., which manufactures kinase inhibitor and other new drugs, terminated its plan to list its shares on the country's tech-laden minor stock market amid sluggish investor interest, with renewable energy firm Daemyoung Energy Inc. recently following suit for the same reason.

"Great Republic Mining completes $786,000 IPO, to trade on Canadian Securities Exchange from June 9, 2022",https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/986089/great-republic-mining-completes-786-000-ipo-to-trade-on-canadian-securities-exchange-from-june-9-2022-986089.html,23:20 Thu 09 Jun 2022,2022-07-21 11:34:27.403898,"
Great Republic Mining (CSE:GRM) Corp said it has completed its initial public offering (IPO) of 7.86 million common shares, of which 360,000 shares were sold under an overallotment option, at a price of 10 cents per share for gross proceeds of $786,000.
The shares were listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange on June 7, 2022, and immediately halted pending closing of the IPO. The shares are expected to resume trading on June 9, 2022, under the symbol GRM.
The company said the net proceeds from the IPO will be used to carry out exploration of the company's project, the Porcher property, located in the northwest part of British Columbia on Porcher Island. The net proceeds will also be used to make payments under the option agreement in respect of the Porcher property, for general and administrative purposes, and for working capital.
Haywood Securities Inc acted as agent for the IPO. The agent received a cash commission equal to 10% of the gross proceeds raised under the IPO and a corporate finance fee, in addition to the reimbursement of certain expenses.
Additionally, the company granted the agent and members of its selling group non-transferable agent's compensation options entitling the holder to purchase an aggregate of 550,200 shares at a price of 10 cents per share, exercisable on or before June 8, 2024.
Great Republic Mining is engaged in the business of acquiring and exploring mineral resource properties. The company has an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Porcher property, which is composed of nine contiguous mineral titles covering an area of 3,560.4 hectares in the northwest part of British Columbia, Canada, approximately 40 kilometres southwest of the city of Prince Rupert on Porcher Island.

City job cuts loom as London IPOs dwindle,https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/986337/city-job-cuts-loom-as-london-ipos-dwindle-986337.html,22:40 Thu 30 Jun 2022,2022-07-21 11:34:30.791105,"
City of London firms are preparing to make job cuts as the boom in initial public offers (IPOs) seen last year almost entirely dries up in 2022.
This comes as massive amounts of cash have been pulled out of the stock market by investors, with the FTSE All-Share index down 8% so far this year and the AIM index down over 27%.
Bankers have already taken the lead, with RBC Capital Markets and Berenberg, Gossler & Co laying off workers in London and elsewhere, while Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) and Numis Corporation PLC (AIM:NUM) among several that reportedly are also cutting headcount.
New York search firm DMC Partners' David McCormack told CNBC that investment banks will be forced to rip out costs as their revenues in the second quarter fall.
The second quarter of 2022 registered the lowest number of IPOs on the UK's AIM junior market since 2009, with only one company raising £6mln.
BrewDog and Mishcon de Reya are among the companies that have confirmed they are holding off on going public. 
Such low IPO activity was last seen in the first quarter of 2009, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, when just one IPO raised £3mln. 
Last year the second quarter saw 16 IPOs raise a total of £218mln. 
""A sense of foreboding is again gripping financial markets, with anxiety rising that by attacking inflation, central banks risk severely weakening economies,"" said Susannah Streeter, markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
""The fragility of the UK economy has come under the spotlight with the final GDP data for first quarter, showing that although output grew 0.8%, real household disposable incomes fell by 0.2%, a bigger drop than previously estimated.""
The current market conditions are said to be keeping 87% of fast-growing UK businesses from going public, according to research from Coupa Software.
In addition to rising interest rates, supply chain shortages, recent stock market volatility, and rising inflation, the top reasons cited for delaying an IPO are all related to current market conditions.
Deals have also been put on hold due to market uncertainty.
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) has called off plans to sell its high street pharmacy business in the UK, blaming global financial conditions for the delay.
Uncertainty over how much central banks will tighten policy as they look to reverse rampant inflation is one of the reasons keeping companies away, as it has knocked stock market confidence and comes amid slowing consumer spending and recession worries.
UK businesses today called for urgent help from the government as they face a perfect storm of rising costs, supply chain issues and problems recruiting staff.

Home gym Tonal tones up for IPO or recessions by shedding 35% of workforce,https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/987461/home-gym-tonal-tones-up-for-ipo-or-recessions-by-shedding-35-of-workforce-987461.html,18:34 Thu 14 Jul 2022,2022-07-21 11:34:31.821102,"
Tonal, the rival of Peloton which is backed by athlete Serena Williams and Amazon’s Alexa fund, has slashed 35% of its workforce as it prepares for possible recession and an initial public offer.
The fitness equipment maker joins a list of companies, including Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON), reducing head count to reduce expenses.
Aly Orady, Tonal's chief executive, said the company is trying to become profitable so that it can go public, and that it currently employs 750 people, up from about 110 before the Covid-19 pandemic.
As the company considers an IPO, Orady stressed the need for profitability, adding the company hasn't been profitable in the past but the job cuts would put the company on track to make money within a few months.
All impacted employees will receive a minimum of eight weeks of continued pay, as well as health-care benefits through September, Tonal said.
During the pandemic with consumers stuck at home and searching for ways to exercise, Tonal registered rampant growth in 2020 and 2021.
By partnering with star athletes like LeBron James and Williams, Tonal was also able to increase its brand awareness. 
A total of US$450mln has been raised to date, with the company valued at US$1.6bn at one point in 2021.
For now, Tonal is putting the brakes on, with the CEO saying, ""As we head into a recession, and many of us believe we’re headed into a recession, it’s really important that we become a business that’s here for the long term. What we’re doing is effectively going from a hypergrowth business ... to more of a sustained-growth business.""

Ant Group's massive IPO may be allowed to resume ,https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/984511/ant-group-s-massive-ipo-may-be-allowed-to-resume-984511.html,21:59 Thu 09 Jun 2022,2022-07-21 11:34:33.742773,"
Ant Group Co, a financial-technology giant based in China, plans to raise at least US$34.4bn in what will be the world's biggest-ever initial public offering (IPO) in both Shanghai and Hong Kong.
Founded by Jack Ma of Alibaba fame, Ant is reportedly looking to raise US$17.2bn in each city, based on prices of 68.8 yuan and HK$80 per share, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission has formed a team to reassess the share sale plans.
The fintech giant could raise up to a maximum of about US$5.2bn more if underwriters exercise their option to buy up to 15% more shares in what is known as a 'green shoe' option, Bloomberg reported.
These figures would surpass the US$25bn raised in 2014 by Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) and the US$29.4bn raised by Saudi Aramco in the world's largest-ever IPO in 2014.
After including the new capital raised but before adding the green shoe, the tech giant would be valued at about US$313bn. In comparison, Mastercard had a market value of US$330bn as of Friday's close.
From finance to tech 
Ant, which has been under state guidance since its planned IPO was called off in 2020 amid regulatory uncertainty, published an ESG report last week which indicates a clear shift to technology away from finance as the Chinese government wants big tech to do more in order to boost the economy.
The company said its research spending has grown 39% a year for three years, with more than 18.8 billion yuan (US$2.82bn) invested in 2021.
China abruptly suspended Ant's plans for a US$37bn IPO in November 2020 in Shanghai and Hong Kong days before the stock was expected to begin trading and launched a regulatory crackdown across the technology sector.
Ant is controlled by billionaire Ma who, after making a speech in Shanghai in October 2020 accusing financial regulators of hindering innovation, has seen authorities crack down on his empire and other tech firms, which also hit London-listed investors.

Some had valued Porsche at more than 80 billion euros ($81.89 billion), according to bankers involved.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterBut the people involved said a bigger-than-usual markdown may now be necessary to secure what could be one of the world's largest stock-market debuts - in the face of war, threat of recession and energy shortages.Porsche may have to settle for as little as 60 billion euros, one of the people said, noting that the owners would not accept anything less.The people shared their assessment, amid a wider debate about the price tag for one of Germany's most prestigious brands unfolding weeks ahead of the expected IPO.One of the people said owners of the fastcar maker have different views on how highly it should be valued. A third person involved in the preparations said investors had yet to agree on a valuation formula.This week, Porsche's top management outlined their business plans to investors. Chief Finance Officer Lutz Meschke told journalists the carmaker was ""financially resilient"" and ""well-prepared for further steps"".Porsche estimated revenue of more than 38 billion in 2022, up from 33 billion in 2021, despite a 5% drop in deliveries in the first six months of this year.  read more Behind the scenes, however, some investors are wavering.Last month, Bernstein Research put a wide range of possible valuations on Porsche, from 55 billion euros to 100 billion euros.It set the 'fair value' at about 75 billion euros, based on a formula including Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT), calling Porsche ""a great company but not Ferrari"" because of the latter's higher margins.A top-20 Volkswagen shareholder told Reuters it was not keen on the IPO because only a small amount of stock will be sold, giving new shareholders little influence.The shareholder, asking not to be named, said Porsche would be better off staying within the Volkswagen Group, while the IPO would not ""create value"" in the long term.1/4Attendees look at the 2022 Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS during the 2021 LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S. November 17, 2021. REUTERS/Ringo ChiuRead MoreEarlier this week, Porsche Chief Executive Oliver Blume and Meschke were upbeat in their presentations.Business was robust during the pandemic, Blume said. ""There is big need in the capital markets and a lot of money to invest.""Bankers running the deal intend to survey market conditions at the end of August, with a Porsche board decision and an intention to float (ITF) document potentially set for publication soon after, and a view to trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange at the turn of the third to fourth quarter, the people said.A spokesperson for Porsche said there had been no ""new decisions"" on its IPO plans, while Volkswagen declined to comment.ELECTRIC SWITCHThe listing is happening as Germany's carmakers seek to loosen the bond with the diesel and petrol motors that won global acclaim and shift towards quieter, cleaner battery models.Porsche wants 80% of its car sales to be electric by 2030, roughly quadrupling the current level, while Volkswagen has also embarked on an ambitious shift towards electric vehicles, batteries and software. The listing is designed to fund that overhaul.If the listing does not go ahead or gets through only at a discount, there is less to invest.A listing would also shift the balance of power at Europe's top carmaker, Volkswagen, which controls Porsche since a botched takeover attempt of VW more than a decade ago. At the time, the Porsche and Piech families became Volkswagen's most influential investors.An IPO would win Porsche and its family owners greater control over the sportscar maker, the company has said.However, the economic hurdles are steep.Just $2.3 billion has been raised on German equity capital markets this year, down 90% on a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data. Only 12.5% of Porsche stock will be in 'free float', and European carmakers' valuations have plunged since the start of 2022.Luxury carmakers have been particularly hard hit. Aston Martin's market cap has lost 57% of its value since the beginning of 2022, while almost a third has been shaved off Ferrari's valuation.One banker involved said Porsche might be compared to highly rated luxury brands, such as French luxury goods house LVMH (LVMH.PA), but it still remains in the shadow of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).($1 = 0.9769 euros)Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterAdditional reporting by Christoph Steitz in Frankfurt, Victoria Waldersee in Berlin and Lucy Raitano in London; editing by John O'Donnell and Richard ChangOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

(""17EdTech"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: YQ) securities pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement and prospectus (collectively, the ""Registration Statement"") issued in connection with the Company's December 2020 initial public offering (""IPO"" or the ""Offering""). 17EdTech investors have until September 19, 2022 to file a lead plaintiff motion.

 On July 23, 2021, the Company stated that China's new regulations regarding after-school tutoring had ""not been published, and the Company has not received official notification of the regulations.""
 On this news, 17EdTech's ADS price fell $3.56, or 39%, to close at $5.64 per ADS on July 23, 2021, thereby injuring investors.

 CASE ALLEGATIONS: 17 Education & Technology offered tutoring services related to academic subjects to students from kindergarten through the last year of senior high school (""K-12 Academic AST Services"") in the People's Republic of China (""PRC""). On December 4, 2020, 17 Education & Technology held its IPO, issuing approximately 27,400,000 American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") to the investing public at $10.50 per ADS, pursuant to the Registration Statement.
 PRC authorities have been targeting private education companies and tutoring companies, especially including those that are Western-financed, for reform publicly since at least February 2019. In January 2021, the month after the IPO, Chinese authorities publicly made clear within the PRC, again, that they would reform the private tutoring industry in which 17 Education & Technology operated. In doing so, for example, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the highest internal enforcement division of the Chinese Communist Party, and the National Supervision Commission of the PRC released an article warning about reforms of abuses by private education companies. In light of the proposed, discussed, and enacted reforms from and connected to the 2018-2022 plan for modernizing Chinese education, several other Chinese education technology firms, including VIPKid, Huohua Siwei, Zuoyebang, and Yuanfudao, reportedly scrapped or postponed plans for initial public offerings.
 The 17 Education & Technology Group class action lawsuit alleges that the IPO's Registration Statement was false and/or misleading and/or failed to disclose that: (i) 17 Education & Technology's K-12 Academic AST Services would end less than a year after the IPO; and (ii) as part of its ongoing regulatory efforts, Chinese authorities would imminently curtail and/or end 17 Education & Technology's core business.
 On July 23, 2021, mere months after the IPO, Chinese authorities formally revealed to the public continued regulations which banned after-school tutoring companies that teach the school curriculum from making profits, raising capital, or going public. These measures formally ended any potential growth in the for-profit tutoring sector in the PRC.
 As of July 13, 2022, the price of 17 Education & Technology ADS has fallen by approximately 85% from the $10.50 IPO price.
 THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired 17 Education & Technology publicly traded securities pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement issued in connection with the IPO to seek appointment as lead plaintiff. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the 17 Education & Technology class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the 17 Education & Technology class action lawsuit. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the 17 Education & Technology class action lawsuit.

The Firm is ranked #1 on the 2021 ISS Securities Class Action Services Top 50 Report for recovering nearly $2 billion for investors last year alone - more than triple the amount recovered by any other plaintiffs' firm.

 ",2022-07-21," NEW YORK, July  20, Jul 20, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) --
 EQNX::TICKER_START (NASDAQ:MOLN), EQNX::TICKER_END WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Molecular Partners AG (NASDAQ: MOLN): (i) pursuant and/or traceable to the offering documents issued in connection with the Company's initial public offering conducted on or about June 16, 2021 (the ""IPO""); and/or (ii) between June 16, 2021 and April 26, 2022, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the important September 12, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline.
 SO WHAT: If you purchased Molecular Partners securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
 WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Molecular Partners class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=7548 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 12, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
 WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
 DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the IPO documents were negligently prepared and, as a result, contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and were not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their preparation. Additionally, the complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the IPO documents and defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) ensovibep was less effective at treating COVID-19 than defendants had led investors to believe; (2) accordingly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") was reasonably likely to require an additional Phase 3 study of ensovibep before granting the drug Emergency Use Authorization (""EUA""); (3) waning global rates of COVID-19 significantly reduced the Company's chances of securing EUA for ensovibep; (4) as a product candidate, MP0310 (AMG 506), in development for the treatment of certain types of cancer,  was less attractive to Amgen Inc. (""Amgen"") than defendants had led investors to believe; (5) accordingly, there was a significant likelihood that Amgen would return global rights of MP0310 to Molecular Partners; (6) as a result of all the foregoing, the clinical and commercial prospects of ensovibep and MP0310 were overstated; and (7) as a result, the IPO documents and defendants' public statements throughout the Class Period were materially false and/or misleading and failed to state information required to be stated therein. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

 No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Missfresh Limited Investor Alert: Kaplan Fox Investigates Potential Securities Law Violations at Missfresh,https://futures.tradingcharts.com/news/futures/Missfresh_Limited_Investor_Alert__Kaplan_Fox_Investigates_Potential_Securities_Law_Violations_at_Missfresh_410607499.html," NEW YORK, July  20, Jul 20, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) --
 ",2022-07-21," NEW YORK, July  20, Jul 20, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) --
 EQNX::TICKER_START (NasdaqGM:MF), EQNX::TICKER_END Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP (www.kaplanfox.com) is investigating claims on behalf of investors of Missfresh Limited (""Missfresh"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: MF). Missfresh purports to be an innovator and leader in China's neighborhood retail industry focusing on offering fresh produce and fast-moving consumer goods.
 In June 2021, Missfresh conducted its initial public offering (IPO) by selling 21 million American Depository Shares (""ADSs"") at $13.00 per ADS. A complaint has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Missfresh securities pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement for Missfresh's June 2021 IPO.
 On April 29, 2022, after trading hours, Missfresh filed a Notification of Late Filing on a Form 12b-25, which announced that Missfresh ""will not be able to file its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 ... by the prescribed filing deadline of April 30, 2022."" Missfresh explained that ""[t]he independent Audit Committee of the Company's board of directors, with the assistance of professional advisors, is in the process of conducting an internal review of certain matters, including those relating to transactions between the Company and certain third-party enterprises."" Following this news, Missfresh ADSs fell 13% to close at $0.448 per ADS on May 2, 2021, the first trading day following the news.
 Then, on May 24, 2022, after trading hours, Missfresh issued a press release entitled ""Missfresh Announces Receipt of Nasdaq Notification Regarding Late Filing of Form 20-F"" announcing ""that it received a notification letter dated May 19, 2022 . . . from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. (""Nasdaq""), indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the requirements for continued listing."" Following this news, the complaint alleges that Missfresh ADSs fell 9% over the next two trading days to close at $0.167 per ADS on May 26, 2021.
 Finally, on July 1, 2022, Missfresh issued a press release entitled ""Missfresh Announces the Substantial Completion of the Audit Committee-Led Independent Internal Review."" In the press release, Missfresh disclosed that ""certain revenue associated with these reporting periods in 2021 may have been inaccurately recorded in the Company's financial statements."" As of the date the complaint was filed, Missfresh ADSs closed at $0.389 per ADS, well below Missfresh's IPO price of $13.00 per ADS.
 If you are a member of the proposed Class, you may move the court no later than September 12, 2022 to serve as a lead plaintiff for the purported class. You need not seek to become a lead plaintiff in order to share in any possible recovery. If you would like to discuss the complaint or our investigation, please contact us by emailing pmayer@kaplanfox.com or by calling (646) 315-9003.

"ROSEN, THE FIRST FILING FIRM, Encourages Missfresh Limited Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action Commenced by the Firm - MF",https://futures.tradingcharts.com/news/futures/ROSEN__THE_FIRST_FILING_FIRM__Encourages_Missfresh_Limited_Investors_to_Secure_Counsel_Before_Important_Deadline_in_Securities_Class_Action_Commenced_by_the_Firm___MF_410604876.html," NEW YORK, July 20, 2022 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
 ",2022-07-21," NEW YORK, July 20, 2022 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
 WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces it has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of the securities of Missfresh Limited (NASDAQ: MF) pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement and prospectus (collectively, the ""Registration Statement"") issued in connection with the Company's June 2021 initial public offering (""IPO"" or the ""Offering""). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 12, 2022.
 SO WHAT: If you purchased Missfresh securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
 WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Missfresh class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=7370 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 12, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
 WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
 DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the IPO Registration Statement featured false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Missfresh provided false financial figures in its Registration Statement; (2) Missfresh would need to amend its financial figures; (3) Missfresh, among other things, had lesser net revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2021; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times and negligently prepared. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
 To join the Missfresh class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=7370 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
 No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

 ",2022-07-21," LOS ANGELES, July 20, 2022 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
 Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP (""GPM"") reminds investors of the upcoming September 12, 2022 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Missfresh Limited (""Missfresh"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: MF) securities pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement and prospectus (collectively, the ""Registration Statement"") issued in connection with the Company's June 2021 initial public offering (""IPO"" or the ""Offering"").

 In June 2021, Missfresh held its IPO, selling 21 million American Depository Shares (""ADSs"") at $13 per ADS.
 On April 29, 2022, Missfresh disclosed that it could not timely file its fiscal 2021 annual report because it was conducting ""an internal review of certain matters, including those relating to transactions between the Company and certain third-party enterprises.""
 On this news, Missfresh's stock fell 13%, to close at $0.448 per ADS on May 2, 2022, thereby injuring investors.
 Then, on July 1, 2022, after the market closed. Missfresh announced that, based on substantial completion of the internal review, certain revenue reported during fiscal 2021 ""may have been inaccurately recorded."" Specifically, the review identified ""questionable transactions"" carried out by the Next-Day Delivery Business Unit in 2021, including ""undisclosed relationships between suppliers and customers, different customers or suppliers sharing the same contact information, and/or lack of supporting logistics information.""
 Since the IPO, Missfresh's ADSs have traded as low as $0.3075, representing a 97% decline from the IPO price.
 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Missfresh provided false financial figures in its Registration Statement; (2) Missfresh would need to amend its financial figures; (3) Missfresh, among other things, had lesser net revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2021; and (4) as a result, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.
 Follow us for updates on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook.
 If you purchased or otherwise acquired Missfresh securities pursuant and/or traceable to the IPO, you may move the Court no later than September 12, 2022 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit. To be a member of the class action you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the class action. If you wish to learn more about this class action, or if you have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to the pending class action lawsuit, please contact Charles Linehan, Esquire, of GPM, 1925 Century Park East, Suite 2100, Los Angeles, California 90067 at 310-201-9150, Toll-Free at 888-773-9224, by email to shareholders@glancylaw.com, or visit our website at www.glancylaw.com. If you inquire by email please include your mailing address, telephone number and number of shares purchased.

"Through IPO, Mask Manufacturer Evo Plusmed Releases 20% Shares to the Public",https://investasi.kontan.co.id/news/lewat-ipo-produsen-masker-evo-plusmed-melepas-20-saham-ke-publik, 21 Juli 2022 / 06:31 WIB ,2022-07-21,"Reporter: Nur Qolbi | Editor: Wahyu T. Rahmawati KONTAN.CO.ID - JAKARTA. PT Hetzer Medical Indonesia Tbk, a mask manufacturer with the Evo Plusmed brand, plans to hold an initial public offering (IPO). Hetzer Medical will release a maximum of 312.5 million shares to the public or equivalent to 20% of the issued and fully paid capital. The offering price ranges from Rp 125-Rp 175 per share. Thus, the fresh funds targeted for this IPO are Rp 39.06 billion-Rp 54.69 billion. Hetzer Medical will use the IPO funds to renovate the warehouse into an operational factory. The company will also purchase machines to produce new mask variants, namely Duckbill masks, KN95, KF94, and N95 masks, as well as purchase production raw materials. Read also: IPO plans flood the stock market With the addition of this product, Hetzer Medical will produce a wider variety of masks. The products currently being sold by the company include EVO-5ply Mask, EVO-4D Mask, EVO-3ply Mask, Spark Series, PON Series, Red and White Masks, and others. Hetzer Medical sells its products in business to business (B2B), business to government (B2G), and direct to consumer (D2C) ways.

Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Aramco) announced on Sunday an 82
percent year-on-year increase in net income in the first quarter
(Q1) of 2022, Trend reports citing Xinhua.
The net income increased to 39.5 billion U.S. dollars, setting a
new quarterly earnings record for the company since its initial
public offering (IPO) in 2019, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
Aramco also declared a Q1 dividend of 18.8 billion dollars to be
paid in the second quarter.
The results were underpinned by higher crude oil prices and
volumes sold, along with improved downstream margins.
""During the first quarter, our strategic downstream expansion
progressed further in both Asia and Europe, and we continue to
develop opportunities that complement our growth objectives,""
Aramco President and CEO Amin H. Nasser said. 
 
In China, the company made a final investment decision in March
to participate in the development of a major integrated refinery
and petrochemical complex.
The joint venture, with North Huajin Chemical Industries Group
Corporation and Panjin Xincheng Industrial Group, includes
establishing a 300,000 barrels per day refinery and petrochemicals

Ola has delayed its initial public offering (IPO). The company
was very close to file for the IPO but decided to defer the plan,
according to a Business Today report, Trend reports citing India Today.
The IPO could hit the market later this year or early next year,
OLA CEO Bhavish Aggarwal said.
""We were actually very close to filing. We as a board took a
call to do it later. It could be later this year or early next year
because we’re actually ready. Our ride hailing business is very

Israel aims to sell 40% of its national postal service in a Tel
Aviv share offering by the end of 2022 and cut 1,600 jobs as part
of its plan to save the financially strapped Israel Post Co from
collapse, the communications regulator said on Thursday, Trend reports with reference
to Reuters.
The remaining 60% stake would be sold to a strategic investor by
mid-2023, Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel told reporters.
The service suffers from problems that have not been addressed
for years, including a manpower surplus, inefficiencies, and
over-regulation.
""After years of neglect, we are undertaking vital root canal
treatment,"" Hendel said.
Ministry officials could not provide a more detailed timetable
for the offering on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, noting the process
was under way and they were working with underwriters.
After years of poor performance, Israel Post -- which has 5,170
workers -- has been carrying out a major reorganisation, including
changing its array of delivery centres and reducing its
workforce.
Nonetheless, the company posted a cumulative operating loss of 1
billion shekels ($309 million) between 2016 and 2021 as the market
changed and customers use the post less. 


 
As long as the state remains in control, it will have to keep
injecting hundreds of millions of shekels every few years, Hendel
said.
Hendel said that under the plan, many postal services, such as
registered mail, would be shifted to digital platforms within 18
months.
A 2018 plan for partial privatisation, including a 20% sale to a
strategic investor and later an IPO of 20%, was not sufficient, the
ministry has said.
On Wednesday, the post service's board named David Laron, deputy
chief executive of retailer Shufersal, as its new CEO, contingent
on government approval.

Dubai utility DEWA to raise $6.1 billion in biggest Gulf IPO since 2019

Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) is set to raise
22.32 billion dirhams ($6.1 billion) after pricing its initial
public offering at the top of the range on Wednesday, in the Gulf's
biggest IPO since Saudi Aramco's record deal in 2019, Trend reports with reference
to Reuters.
DEWA will add to growing volume from issuers in the Gulf, where
$3.5 billion has been raised from IPOs this year, data from
Refinitiv shows, exceeding European listings even as global markets
remain volatile.
Dubai's deputy ruler and finance minister Sheikh Maktoum Bin
Mohammed said in a tweet that DEWA had attracted 315 billion
dirhams of demand for the IPO, with buyers including sovereign
wealth funds, private fund and 65,000 individual investors.
State utility DEWA had set an indicative price range of 2.25
dirhams to 2.48 dirhams, with the top level expected to raise 22.32
billion dirhams for the Dubai government.
As well as raising money for Dubai, the IPO aims to help the
Emirate's exchange compete more effectively with bigger rivals in
the region, such as those in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.
DEWA's public share sale is the biggest to date in the Emirate
and is also set to become the region's largest since Saudi Aramco's
$29.4 billion IPO, the world's biggest.
DEWA said in its prospectus the 18% share sale by the Dubai
government was aimed at boosting trading liquidity in the stock
market and raising its own profile with international
investors. 
 
The shares are set to begin trading on the Dubai Financial
Market on April 12, with DEWA the largest company on the bourse
with a market capitalisation of $33.8 billion.
Demand for DEWA's IPO has been strong, prompting it to first
raise the size of the institutional offer and then boosting the
retail portion by almost three times on Saturday.
Citigroup, Emirates NBD Capital and HSBC are joint global IPO
coordinators, while Credit Suisse, EFG Hermes, First Abu Dhabi Bank
PJSC and Goldman Sachs are joint bookrunners.
Emirates NBD and Moelis & Co acted as financial advisors.

Indian billionarie Gautam Adani’s food venture Adani Wilmar is best-performing IPO in Asia

India’s Adani Wilmar Ltd. is an outlier among Asia’s newly
listed stocks. The food company has almost tripled since its debut
while most newcomers are trading under water, Trend reports citing The
Print.
Shares in the firm, a joint venture between the group controlled
by Asia’s richest person Gautam Adani and Singapore’s Wilmar
International Ltd., have outperformed 121 Asian initial public
offerings worth over $100 million this year. Almost two-thirds of
the region’s new listings are in the red as rising interest rates
and the war in Ukraine take a toll.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore and Nippon Life India were
among investors in Adani Wilmar’s IPO, which makes Fortune brand
cooking oils, wheat flour, rice, pulses, sugar and other food
products. The firm said it would use part of the funds in the $486
million offering to expand facilities, repay loans and make
strategic acquisitions.
The company is expected to “continue to gain market share on
account of strong distribution network, diversified product
portfolio, market leadership in key categories, focus on rural
market, new product launches and strong parentage,” said Vikrant
Kashyap, an analyst at KR Choksey.
The strong performance bodes well for Adani, one of Asia’s
busiest dealmakers, who’s expanding his reach after years of
focusing on coal and infrastructure-related plays. The tycoon’s
move to diversify into new areas like data centers and digital
services has paid off, after he capped a run of some 32
acquisitions in the past year. 
 
The JV, which paid off debt with funds from the IPO, gets
“significant benefit” from its parents, Kashyap wrote in a note
this month, which recommended the stock as accumulate. Expected
acquisitions will lead to a gain in market share, he added. The
firm recently announced the purchase of several brands, including
the Kohinoor cooking brand for the India region.
Other stocks linked to Adani have also done well. Adani Power
Ltd., up more than 200% this year, is the top performer among
members of the S&P BSE 500 index. Adani Green Energy Ltd., up
65% year-to-date, is the fifth-best performer even as the firm has

Lyft shares tank 26% on higher cost of getting drivers back on street

Lyft Inc stock plunged 26% on Tuesday after the ride hail
company said it would have to spend more heavily to attract drivers
and forecast operating earnings less than a quarter of Wall Street
targets, reflecting the added costs, Trend reports with reference to Reuters.
A full recovery of driver supply from pandemic lows was taking
longer than Lyft had hoped, President John Zimmer said in an
interview with Reuters.
The quarterly report also spooked investors in rival Uber
Technologies Inc, which fell 11% in after hours trade following
Lyft's report. Uber recouped some losses to a drop of 4% after it
moved up its own quarterly results publication plan to Wednesday
morning from Wednesday afternoon.
""It will be very interesting to see if Uber feels the need to
similarly ramp investments ... or if Lyft is unique in struggling
to bring back and retain drivers for some reason,"" said D.A.
Davidson analyst Tom White, ascribing Lyft's stock losses to the
driver costs and outlook.
Executives said the driver incentives were necessary to meet the
increase in demand it anticipates this year, particularly on the
U.S. West Coast which has so far lagged other U.S. regions in a
recovery.
Lyft said it expected adjusted EBITDA, a metric that excludes
stock-based compensation and some other costs, of between $10
million and $20 million in the second quarter. That is
significantly below the $54.8 million it reported on Tuesday for
the first three months of the year. Analysts on average expected
$82.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The share slump in after-hours trade wiped about $2.8 billion
off Lyft's market value. The stock was already trading down about
60% from its IPO in 2019.
Lyft's spending on drivers was significant and ""crushed"" the
profit foreacast, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note.
Lyft executives declined to provide cost details for driver
incentives in response to questions from analysts on a call
following its results. One executive said Lyft would use higher
prices to help finance some spending on drivers.
The number of drivers, many of whom left as demand dwindled
during the pandemic, remained below pre-pandemic levels, Zimmer
said.
Lyft and Uber have tried to lure back drivers with added
incentives in recent quarters.
Lyft also forecast second-quarter revenue of $950 million to $1
billion, shy of the average analyst estimate of $1.02 billion,
according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
First-quarter active ridership fell 4.8% from the previous
quarter in the first three months of the year. 


 
Active riders were 17.8 million, down from 18.7 million in the
previous quarter and up from 13.5 million a year earlier. Ridership
is typically lower in the first quarter with demand for ride-hail,
bike and scooter trips declining during the colder months.
But consumers eager for post-pandemic normalcy shrugged off
higher prices, Zimmer told Reuters.
""That tailwind coming out of the pandemic is much more impactful
to our business ... than is the impact of inflation,"" Zimmer
said.
Lyft and Uber have instituted a temporary fuel surcharge in an
effort to help drivers.
Lyft reported first-quarter revenue of $875.6 million, beating
average analysts' expectations for $846 million, according to
Refinitiv data.
At $54.8 million, adjusted EBITDA significantly surpassed its
own guidance and analyst expectations. Analysts had expected $17.8
million in adjusted EBITDA after Lyft guided for a top range of $15
million.
Lyft executives have repeatedly talked about the company's
pricing power, a trend Zimmer expects to continue even as consumers
face wider price increases for goods and services across the
economy. read more
Lyft's chief financial officer, Elaine Paul, said on Tuesday
that concerns over inflation were not impacting the company's
revenue outlook.
Average U.S. per-ride prices for Lyft and Uber were 37% higher
in March than during the same month in 2019, according to research
company YipitData.
Zimmer said demand overall still remained 30% below pre-pandemic
levels in the fourth quarter of 2019, giving the company ""quite a
bit of headroom.""

Dubai's biggest lender, Emirates NBD, posted a rise of 18% in
quarterly net profit as impairment allowances fell sharply on
economic recovery from the pandemic, while higher interest rates
boosted its net interest rate margin, Trend reports with reference to Reuters.
The bank said it raised its net interest margin guidance by 15
basis points and is well-positioned for an expected rise in
interest rates.
Net profit of 2.7 billion dirhams ($735.17 million) in the
period ended March 31 was up from 2.3 billion dirhams in the
corresponding period a year earlier, the bank said in a
statement.
EFG Hermes Research had projected net profit of 2.47 billion
dirhams.
Impairments fell by a fifth to 1.4 billion dirhams, reflecting
last year's improving operating environment after the pandemic.
Net interest income, the core figure for the banking sector,
rose 4% from a year earlier, helped by a higher net interest rate
margin. It is also benefiting from low cost of funds, while loans
grew 1%, fuelled by strong retail lending. 


 
The UAE central bank, like most in the Gulf, raised its main
interest rates by a quarter percentage point last month, in
lockstep with the U.S. Federal Reserve as it began a monetary
tightening cycle.
Emirates NBD is also expected to improve non-interest income
from a spate of initial public offerings in Dubai, which kicked off
with a key role in the $6.1 billion IPO of utility DEWA, the
region's biggest IPO since Saudi Aramco in 2019.
""These strong results, along with the positive outlook for
margins, enable us to invest in our international network and

Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL).

50,000 crore to Rs 75,000 crore each through IPOs, according to the
Hindu Business Line report.
The target amounts will make both the IPOs India's biggest-ever

Life Insurance Corporation of India's (LIC) IPO is all set to
eclipse Paytm and become India's largest-ever initial share

The problem is, not all investors are buying it. In early meetings with portfolio managers, the Volkswagen unit compared itself to the French handbag maker and Cartier owner Richemont as businesses that generate healthy profits and significant sales volumes, according to people familiar with the matter. It also cited Ferrari, which boasts industry-leading margins but ships only a fraction of the more than 300,000 cars Porsche makes every year. The high valuation of the Porsche IPO is meeting resistance from investors.   Among concerns flagged by investors is a listing structure that fails to make Porsche more independent from its parent, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. They also cited headwinds in the IPO market, which has slowed dramatically due to jitters over runaway inflation, rising interest rates and the war in Ukraine that’s sparked Europe’s worst energy crunch in decades. “Porsche isn’t a safe bet in a recession because it’s not as exclusive as Ferrari,” said Daniel Roeska, an auto analyst at Bernstein. “And if you don’t change the governance and allow Porsche to decide what’s best for itself rather than making decisions at the group level, then you’re not maximising shareholder value.” The offering, which may launch as soon as September, is poised to be one of Europe’s biggest ever. VW has hired more than a dozen banks to push the IPO, which could value Porsche at as much as €80 billion ($120 billion) to €90 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. If achieved, that could even exceed the parent company’s current market value.

Owing to its bumper cash flows and big strides in electrification – the battery-powered Taycan already outsells the 911, and Porsche is targeting more than 80 per cent of its car sales to be electric vehicles by 2030 – a valuation of around €80 billion ($120 billion) looks attainable, according to analysts and back-of-the-envelope calculations. Key car models such as the electric Porsche Macan have been delayed by software issues.   But here’s another eye-catching statistic: the market capitalisation of Volkswagen, which owns 100 per cent of Porsche, has shrunk this year to less than €80 billion, which means the remainder of a group that includes Audi, Lamborghini and Bentley essentially comes for free. VW aims to leapfrog Tesla in electric-vehicle sales within three years, but even with Elon Musk distracted by his Twitter bid, Tesla is worth more than nine times its German rival. Although VW can’t do much about investors’ recession worries, it must do more to ensure its mastery of software is as great as its mechanical engineering. To be sure, VW has often sold for less than the sum of its parts, in part due to its wretched corporate governance. Yet selling a 25 per cent stake in Porsche was supposed to help VW unlock value. There’s no sign of that happening yet. Even though the tech bust has taken the air out of near revenue-less automotive start-ups, this hasn’t translated into greater investor appreciation for more established and profitable car makers. "
Ackman’s record SPAC to return funds after deal hunt fizzled,https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/ackman-s-record-spac-to-return-funds-after-deal-hunt-fizzled-20220712-p5b103,"Jul 12, 2022 – 12.03pm",2022-07-21,"Billionaire investor Bill Ackman told investors in the largest-ever blank-cheque company that it’s returning their $US4 billion ($5.9 billion) after failing to consummate a merger deal. Pershing Square Tontine Holdings’ efforts to find a target company were thwarted in part by what Mr Ackman said was the unexpected recovery of capital markets during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a statement Monday. “The rapid recovery of the capital markets and our economy were good for America but unfortunate for PSTH, as it made the conventional IPO market a strong competitor and a preferred alternative for high-quality businesses seeking to go public,” Mr Ackman said, referring to the blank-cheque firm by its trading symbol. Pershing Square Tontine Holdings in July 2020 helped catapult special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, to record levels as the pandemic took hold. Since the start of that year, more than 1200 SPACs have raised in excess of $US271 billion in initial public offerings, almost three times the volume of all previous years combined, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last year, Mr Ackman’s effort to buy a 10 per cent stake in Universal Music Group from Vivendi SA with a portion of the SPAC’s funds was shot down by regulators. Early discussion with companies including Airbnb and Stripe also failed to yield a deal. Mr Ackman said in Monday’s statement that he’s still “working diligently to launch” a new type of privately funded acquisition vehicle, Pershing Square SPARC Holdings, that will issue publicly traded warrants allowing holders to acquire stock in a newly merged company.

Sebi proposes confidential 'pre-filing' of IPO documents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-proposes-confidential-pre-filing-of-ipo-documents/articleshow/91497942.cms,"  May 11, 2022, 20:26 IST",2022-07-21 11:40:30.912925,"MUMBAI: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Wednesday proposed allowing companies targeting stock market initial public offerings (IPOs) to submit a confidential ""pre-filing"" document, in an effort aimed at safeguarding their sensitive business information. The initial offer document will only need to be filed with Sebi and the stock exchanges, and the company can decide whether to go public or not after the regulator issues its observations, Sebi said in its proposal. Currently in India, companies first file a draft prospectus with SEBI that contains regulatory disclosures, which is also released publicly for comments for at least 21 days. Later, after incorporating any regulatory and other feedback, a final prospectus is filed for approval again. Sebi said one of the concerns for companies is the disclosure of such sensitive information in their draft offer documents, ""which may be beneficial to its competitors, without the certainty that the initial public issuance would be executed."" Globally, countries including the United States and Canada allow a confidential ""pre-filing"" with regulators before a company decides to proceed with an IPO, Sebi said. Sebi is seeking comments from the public on its new proposal by June 6. Such proposals are commonly floated by the market regulator, and there is no certainty that it would be enforced as a policy. "

Considering the above observations, we assign a “SUBSCRIBE” rating for the issue,” Choice Broking said in its note. Brokerage firm Angel One has a neutral rating on the issue. “In terms of valuations, the stock will trade at post issue P/E multiples of 15.3xFY2021 EPS (at the upper end of the issue price band), which is in line with other players like Chambal fertilizer and Deepak fertilizer though they may not be strictly comparable. Given the fact that the company is valued in line with peers and likely to face headwinds in terms of cost pressures due to recent increase in raw material prices, we recommend a neutal rating on the issue.""

What’s in it for investors, markets, policyholders and the government?Earlier in the day, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary at the department of investment and public asset management, said the LIC IPO was being brought to market in May due to strong demand and a ""solid"" anchor investor base. Pandey had also said the size of the LIC IPO is ""optimal"" in current market conditions, defending its move to cut the stake sale plan from 5 per cent. About LICLIC was formed by merging and nationalising 245 private life insurance companies in India on September 1, 1956. It had an initial capital of Rs 5 crore.   LIC is the fifth largest life insurer globally (comparing LIC’s life insurance premium for fiscal 2021 to its global peers’ life insurance premium for 2020) and the largest asset manager in the country as at December 31, 2021. It covers almost 91 per cent of all districts in India and had the largest individual agency network among life insurance entities in India, comprising approximately 1.33 million individual agents.

The company’s promoters are Ajay Adiseshann and Vishvanathan Subramanian, who together hold 59% of the pre-offer capital. PayMate’s digital platform is used by companies that sign up — and their vendors, suppliers, buyers, dealers and distributors — to make statutory payments of direct taxes & GST and utility payments using commercial credit cards. Visa has a partnership with PayMate. Visa cards accounted for more than 90% of commercial credit cards handled through the system as on December 31, 2021. Visa is also a shareholder in PayMate, owning 2.9% of the fully diluted paid-up equity share capital. The issue comprises a combination of an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 375 crore and a fresh issue of Rs 1,125 crore. The OFS segment includes shares of up to Rs 135 crore by Adiseshann and up to Rs 3.3 crore by Subramanian. Other early investors will also be selling. Additionally, the company, in consultation with the lead bankers to the issue, may consider a private placement of equity shares aggregating up to Rs 225 crore. If such a placement is completed, the fresh issue size will be reduced. Of the proceeds from its fresh issuance, Rs 77 crore will be utilised for investment for expanding the business into new geographies and Rs 228 crore for pursuing inorganic initiatives. Of the remaining, Rs 689 crore is for placing cash as collateral with its financial institution partners to improve margins and for general corporate purposes. PayMate started as a consumer-facing company in 2006 but evolved into a B2B payments platform. Its customer base includes companies in IT distribution, FMCG, paints, financial services, cement, auto auxiliary, travel & airline, media, manufacturing, and logistics. The brand launched its platform in the UAE in 2018 through PayMate LLC, a subsidiary, as a Visa-certified business payment solution provider. It is also aiming to expand into other parts of central Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA) regions as well. "
Govt to review LIC IPO timeline due to volatility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-to-review-lic-ipo-timeline-due-to-volatility/articleshow/89932192.cms,"Mar 2, 2022, 08:22 IST",2022-07-21 11:40:32.255532,"MUMBAI: The government will review the timeline for LIC’s initial public offering (IPO) in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent volatility in financial markets across the world. “If global considerations warrant that I need to look at it, I wouldn’t mind looking at it again,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, told a business newspaper in an interview, responding to a query on the timing of the LIC listing. She said that the need for the review arose in the wake of the “full-scale war”. Until now all indications were that the insurance giant’s IPO would proceed on schedule. LIC and the department of investment and public asset management (Dipam) continued to hold roadshows even after the Russian invasion last week. On Saturday, the Cabinet approved the proposal to allow 20% foreign direct investment (FDI) in LIC — which was a pre-requisite for the IPO considering that a large chunk of the money is set to come from foreign investors. It was widely expected that the IPO would open between March 7 and 10 as the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) was filed with the markets regulator on February 13. Adding to the speculation was a currency swap announced by the RBI, which would be conducted on March 8. The currency swap was designed to absorb surplus liquidity in the banking system, which was likely on account of the IPO. Although the government had not disclosed the intended mop-up, given the valuation, the IPO size was estimated to be Rs 65,000-75,000 crore — more than 3.5 times Paytm’s Rs 18,300-crore IPO, which is hitherto the largest. According to investment bankers, an IPO is typically launched when there is an upswing in the market. While the Indian equity markets were not in a bear phase there was risk aversion among international investors, which had resulted in a net outflow from foreign portfolio investors. While the government was targeting long-term investors, including sovereign funds to anchor the issue, a correction in the markets would hurt sentiment among retail investors. According to the DRHP, 31.6 crore shares would be offered, representing 5% of the equity stake. The offer document also disclosed the embedded value of LIC at Rs 5.4 lakh crore. Even if a conservative 2.5x multiple were applied to the EV, the corporation would be valued at around Rs 13.5 lakh crore, which would result in a 5% mop-up through the IPO. "

Sebi moots new disclosure framework for IPOs of loss-making companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-moots-new-disclosure-framework-for-ipos-of-loss-making-companies/articleshow/89671232.cms,"  Feb 18, 2022, 22:17 IST",2022-07-21 11:40:33.199043,"NEW DELHI: Markets watchdog Sebi on Friday proposed that loss-making new age technology companies planning to list their shares should make disclosures about their key performance indicators considered for arriving at the basis of issue price in offer documents. Besides, such companies should make disclosures about their valuations based on issuance of new shares and acquisition of shares in the past 18 months before filing draft offer documents, according to a consultation paper. The move comes against the backdrop of many new age companies, that do not have a track record of having an operating profit at least in the preceding three years, tapping the Initial Public Offering (IPO) route to raise funds. Such firms generally remain loss-making for a longer period before achieving break-even as they opt for ways to gain scale of operations rather than profits in the initial years. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has sought comments from the public on the consultation paper till March 5. At present, the 'Basis of Issue Price' section in an offer document covers disclosures of traditional parameters such as key accounting ratios. These include Earnings Per Share (EPS), price to earnings, return on net worth and net asset value of the company as well as comparison of such accounting ratios with its peers. According to Sebi, these parameters are typically descriptive of companies which are profit making and do not relate to a loss-making firm. These parameters may not aid investors in taking investment decisions with respect to an loss-making issuer. ""It is obvious that disclosures in 'Basis of Issue Price' section, particularly for a loss making company, are required to be supplemented with non-traditional parameters like key performance indicators and disclosure of certain additional parameters such as valuation based on past transactions/ fund raising by issuer company,"" Sebi said in the consultation paper. Apart from disclosing the financial ratios as per the current requirements, Sebi has proposed that the issuer company should also make the disclosures about the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that have been considered/have a bearing for arriving at the 'Basis of Issue Price'. An issuer company should disclose about relevant KPIs during the three years prior to the IPO and an explanation of how these KPIs contribute to form the 'Basis of Issue Price'. Also, an issuer company should disclose all material KPIs that have been shared with any pre-IPO investor at any point of time during the three years prior to the IPO. However, for those KPIs which the issuer company deems are not relevant for the proposed IPO, the issuer should provide adequate explanation with proper cross reference to a table disclosing the said KPIs. KPIs stated by an issuer company should be described and defined clearly, consistently and precisely and should not be misleading. Besides, all KPIs should be certified or audited by statutory auditors. In addition, Sebi has suggested that comparison of KPIs with Indian listed peer companies and/or global listed peer companies (wherever available) should be disclosed in the offer document and comparison of KPIs over time should be explained. Apart from KPIs, an issuer firm has been proposed to make disclosure of valuation of issuer company based on secondary and primary sale, in the 18 months prior to the date of filing of the DRHP/RHP. This is subject to conditions where either acquisition or sale is equal to or more than 5 per cent of the fully diluted paid-up share capital of the issue firm in a single transaction or a group of transactions in a short period of time. With reference to valuation of an issuer company based on secondary sale or acquisition of shares and primary or new issue of shares, Sebi has suggested disclosure of floor price and cap price being times the Weighted Average Cost of Acquisition (WACA) based on primary/ secondary transaction(s) should be disclosed in a tabular form. Sebi also said that an issuer firm should offer a detailed explanation for offer price along with comparison of the issuer 's KPIs and financials ratios such as EPS, return on net worth and net asset value for the last two full financial years and the interim period, if any, included in the offer document. This will enable the investors to have a comparative view of the KPIs and other financial ratios for the same period, the regulator said in the consultation paper. "

Suresh are the promoters of the company each owning 29.22% stake, the RHP showed. “Operationally, we are very well positioned to raise capital and generate significant value from it, and hence from the operations point of view this is the most optimal time for us to go public despite the nature of the markets,” Suresh Kalpathi, executive director and chairman, told TOI. Commenting on the firm's edtech model, he said Veranda has been focused on a hybrid model right from the start to offer customers the choice of content across all channels. “There are plans to set up more hybrid centres for our software learning arm post going public as part of business plans,” he added. Veranda Learning is in the business of offering integrated learning solutions in online, offline hybrid and offline blended formats to students, aspirants, and graduates, and professionals. They provide courses and learning support through their four subsidiaries — Veranda Race (government exams), Veranda CA, Veranda IAS, and Edureka (for software skilling).

In an interview with PTI, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary to the department of investment and public asset management (Dipam), said approval of the insurance regulator is awaited, post which the draft prospectus, detailing the size of the share sale, will be filed. The issue, after approval of Sebi, is likely to hit the market in March, he said. LIC's listing is crucial for the government to meet the lowered revenue estimates of Rs 78,000 crore for the current fiscal. The government has so far raised about Rs 12,000 crore from privatisation of Air India and stake sale in other PSUs. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her 2022-23 Budget speech had said: ""The public issue of the LIC is expected shortly."" Pandey said the embedded value of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) has been arrived at and it has to now get clearance from insurance regulator IRDAI. ""Within 7-10 days, the DRHP (Draft Red Herring Prospectus) for LIC IPO will be filed. Informally, we have been consulting Sebi on various issues. The size of the issue would be mentioned in the DRHP,"" he said. The government aims to come out with the initial public offer (IPO) and subsequently list LIC on the bourses by March, he said. ""A portion of the IPO would be reserved for anchor investors like we have done in case of IPOs of IRFC and RailTel,"" Pandey added. Up to 10 per cent of the LIC IPO issue size would be reserved for policyholders. Actuarial firm Milliman Advisors LLP India has worked out the embedded value of LIC, while Deloitte and SBI Caps have been appointed as pre-IPO transaction advisors. Under the embedded value method, insurance companies' present value of future profit is also included in their present net asset value (NAV). The government has appointed 10 merchant bankers, including Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt Ltd, Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt Ltd and Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt Ltd, to manage the mega IPO of the country's largest insurer. The government is also mulling allowing foreign investors to pick up stake in LIC. As per Sebi rules, foreign portfolio investors (FPI) are permitted to buy shares in a public offer. FDI policy would have to be tweaked for FII/FPI investment in this IPO, as LIC is a corporation and not an insurance company. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had in July last year cleared the proposal for LIC's IPO. "

It also wants these companies to disclose at what price they had issued shares to investors in pre-IPO rounds stretching up to 18 months before filing offer documents with the regulator. The Sebi move came against the backdrop of closing of IPOs and subsequent listing of several new age, tech-enabled companies which are yet to report operating profit. Stock prices of several of these companies are now deep in the red compared to their IPO price. Some are still trading higher than their IPO price but substantially below their listing price. Such loss-making companies have been listing globally for several years. However, in India this is a new trend. In recent months several market commentators, including billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, have openly voiced their doubts about the price at which they sold their shares during the IPO. The investors in these IPOs included a large number of retail ones with hardly any experience of valuing stocks of such companies. On Friday, Sebi put on its website a consultation paper on disclosures for ‘Basis of Issue Price’ and is inviting public comments on the same by March 5. The current disclosure requirement in the draft offer documents were put in with traditional companies in mind. With more and more new age, tech-driven companies which are loss-making eyeing to list, according to Sebi, the existing parameters to judge a company’s IPO offer price “may not help investors much in taking investment decisions with respect to a loss-making issuer”. At present, companies going for an IPO are required to disclose in their offer documents key accounting ratios like earnings per share (EPS), price to earnings, return on net worth and net asset value of the company. Relevant accounting ratios of the IPO-bound company’s peers are also required to be disclosed in the offer document. It may not be possible for a loss-making company to calculate these ratios. Hence Sebi said that for a loss-making company, existing valuation parameters needed to be supplemented with non-traditional parameters like key performance indicators (KPIs). Sebi is also proposing that these companies may also disclose KPIs of their domestic as well as global peers. "

The regulator has prescribed certain conditions for selling shares in an Offer-for-Sale (OFS) under IPO by significant shareholders and has extended anchor investors' lock-in period to 90 days, according to a statement issued by Sebi after its board meeting.  In addition, Sebi has decided to revise allocation methodology for Non-institutional Investors (NIIs).  This comes amid a slew of new-age technology companies filing draft papers with Sebi to raise funds through initial public offerings (IPOs).  Sebi Chairperson Ajay Tyagi asserted that the regulator has no intention to control the prices of IPOs in any manner.  ""Price discovery is a function of the market and that is how it works globally as well,"" he said at a media briefing after the board meeting.  The board of Sebi cleared a proposal to prescribe a combined limit of up to 35 per cent of the fresh issue size for deployment on such objects of inorganic growth initiatives and general corporate purpose (GCP), where the intended acquisition/strategic investment is unidentified in the objects of the offer.  However, such limits will not apply, if the proposed acquisition or strategic investment object has been identified and suitable specific disclosures are made at the time of filing of the offer document.  It is seen that lately in some of the draft offer documents, new-age technology companies are proposing to raise fresh funds for objects where the object is termed as 'funding of inorganic growth Initiatives'.  Also, the regulator said that the amount raised for GCP will be brought under monitoring and utilization of the same will be disclosed in the monitoring agency report.  The report will be placed before the audit committee for consideration ""on a quarterly basis"" instead of ""on an annual basis"".  Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) registered with the Sebi, will be permitted to act as Monitoring Agency instead of Scheduled Commercial Banks and Public Financial Institutions.  ""Such monitoring shall continue till 100 per cent instead of 95 per cent utilization of issue proceeds as at present,"" Sebi said.  The regulator has prescribed certain conditions for Offer-for-Sale (OFS) to the public in an IPO, where draft papers are filed by an issuer without track record.

Tougher IPO norms for loss-making tech companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tougher-ipo-norms-for-loss-making-tech-companies/articleshow/89676557.cms,"  Feb 19, 2022, 07:30 IST",2022-07-21 11:40:35.439760,"MUMBAI:Markets regulator Sebi wants loss-making, new age technology companies planning to go public to disclose how they arrived at the IPO price. It also wants these companies to disclose at what price they had issued shares to investors in pre-IPO rounds stretching up to 18 months before filing offer documents with the regulator. The Sebi move came against the backdrop of closing of IPOs and subsequent listing of several new age, techenabled companies which are yet to report operating profit. Stock prices of several of these companies are now deep in the red compared to their IPO price. Some are still trading higher than their IPO price but substantially below their listing price. Such loss-making companies have been listing globally for several years. However, in India this is a new trend. In recent months several market commentators, including billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, have openly voiced their doubts about the price at which they sold their shares during the IPO. The investors in these IPOs included a large number of retail ones with hardly any experience of valuing stocks of such companies. On Friday, Sebi put on its website a consultation paper on disclosures for ‘Basis of Issue Price’ and is inviting public comments on the same by March 5. The current disclosure requirement in the draft offer documents were put in with traditional companies in mind. With more and more new age, tech-driven companies which are loss-makingeyeing to list, according to Sebi, the existing parameters to judge a company’s IPO offer price “may not help investors much in taking investment decisions with respect to a loss-making issuer”. At present, companies going for an IPO are required to disclose in their offer documents key accounting ratios like earnings per share (EPS), price to earnings, return on net worth and net asset value of the company. Relevant accounting ratios of the IPO-bound company’s peers are also required to be disclosed in the offer document. "

Udaan raised $200 million via a convertible note along with $50 million as debt, showed an internal email by Aditya Pande, CFO at the Bengaluru-headquartered startup. TOI was the first to report about Udaan's efforts to raise capital in new ways, including debt financing from global institutional investors. ""This round was oversubscribed 2x and also saw participation from our existing investors, including those who bought into the company through the secondary (ESoP) round in H1 2021,"" Pande wrote in the email which TOI has reviewed. ""A convertible note is an instrument typically used by companies at pre-IPO stage, and the instrument converts into equity at the IPO,"" he said. The fund raise reflects Udaan's ""broadening the capitalisation strategy"" as it explores a public listing. Udaan's parent company is based out of Singapore and IPO may take place outside India. ""With this convertible offering, we, as a company, have started building a complete new muscle in our finance function - which we will continue to strengthen as we go forward,"" said Pande. "

The security review will put a focus on risks of data being affected, controlled or manipulated by foreign governments after overseas listings, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said, posting the proposed rules on its website. China's cyberspace regulators are imposing tighter restrictions on data collection and data storage. Authorities are also more broadly pushing for companies to list domestically. Two new sets of rules, the Data Security Law and the Personal Information Protection Law, which cover data storage and data privacy respectively, are set to go into effect this year. Saturday's announcement will also require firms to submit the IPO materials they plan to file for review. The security review, according to the CAC, will consider national security risks as ""risk of supply chain interruption due to political, diplomatic, trade and other factors,"" and risk of key data ""maliciously used by foreign governments after listing in foreign countries."" The CAC is seeking public opinion on the proposed rules. The notice comes after Chinese authorities launched a probe of ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc for allegedly violating user privacy, just days after its listing in New York. Didi's shares plunged 20% on news of the probe, and the company said its revenue would be affected. "

Shares peaked at $ 165 per unit and closed at $ 144.71 per unit.



The initial public offering is the culmination of a phenomenal recovery of Airbnb, after its business was severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic earlier this year.



But with quarantine easing, more travelers have opted to stay in homes rather than hotels, helping Airbnb make a profit in the third quarter. The San Francisco-based company also benefited from increased demand for rental housing outside major cities.



""I don't think too many people were expecting to see an Airbnb IPO this summer,"" said Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky.



""We were planning to go public, we prepared the IPO and this was the most incredible trip. It was a pretty big comeback for our hosts and what I hope the trips will be like, ”added Chesky, whose $ 11 billion stake in Airbnb is now worth it.



Founded in 2008 as a conference room booking website, Airbnb listing was one of the most anticipated US IPOs of 2020, which was already a record year for stock market listings.

Uber will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. What income do US drivers have,https://adevarul.ro/economie/afaceri/uber-s-a-listat-bursa-new-york-venituri-soferii-sua-1_5cd5149d445219c57e7522ce/index.html,2019-10-05,2022-07-21,"The XTB analysis team has prepared a report on Uber, from which you can find out, among other things, what are the differences between the business models of Uber and Lyft, what are the risks facing Uber and what does this IPO involve, writes startupcafe. ro.



The largest ridesharing company in the world was born out of the need to order a classic taxi in Paris. Thus, in the minds of two people, a business idea was born. The creators of Uber are Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp. The company was founded in 2009 in San Francisco, California.



At first it was called UberCab, being an application for smartphones that allowed the order of taxis. Later, the word ""cab"" was removed from the name, becoming Uber. Five years after the launch of the service, the one billionth trip was recorded, and Uber has become a symbol of the transportation service revolution.



Currently, Uber is a global company: ""The demand for the company's services is constantly growing, a trend perfectly illustrated by the data on the gross value of revenues, ie the total amount that users spent using the Uber application. In 2018, the value was raised to $ 49.8 billion, an increase of 44% YoY. ""



Uber is the second company in the ridesharing segment to be listed on the stock exchange. Lyft's IPO took place on March 29, 2019. Uber offers a relatively wide range of services, especially in the United States and Europe, making it a more diversified company, while Lyft operates only in the US market.



""UBER is one of the largest and most important debuts on the US stock market in recent years. It's not just about the company's estimated value of over $ 80 billion, it's also about the revolutionary business model that can make a significant difference. On the one hand, UBER is a vision of technological progress, but on the other hand, it is a company that is currently experiencing huge losses. failure ""- says Przemysław Kwiecień - chief economist of XTB Group.



""Uber is not the only company in the industry that generates losses. In fact, this applies to most companies in this segment, including Didi and Grab, which are companies in which Uber owns shares. Therefore, there is a possibility that these companies will not reaches profitability and goes bankrupt, a scenario that would cause major depreciation of the Uber balance sheet ""adds Kwiecień.



When will Uber start to be profitable



The US car-sharing giant had a rapid growth rate in previous years - 209% in 2017 and 142% in 2018. Although the pace has slowed, the rate still exceeds the increase in operating costs, which leads to improved margins.



Gross margin managed to increase from 21.6% in 2014 to 50.1% in 2018. The situation is also improving in terms of net results - Uber continues to record losses, but the net loss decreased from 131.9% in 2014 to 25.8% in 2018. For Lyft, both gross and net margin were 42.3% in 2018.



In addition, Uber had a revenue per driver of $ 2,354 in 2018, while Lyft drivers generated, on average, revenues of $ 1135. Comparing the number of reservations per driver for 2018, we get a similar picture - 10641 dollars for Uber, compared to 4263 dollars for Lyft.



Uber shares will be available to Romanian investors on XTB's xStation platform on the first day of trading, under the Uber.US symbol. Placing orders will be possible before the first trading session."

IPO transactions involving unicorn companies (companies with a value of
over $ 1 billion market) and IPO mega-transactions have propelled the value of capital
attracted in 2018 above the level of 2017. This trend is expected to
is maintained in 2019, due to the increase in the number of IPO candidates and
greater availability of capital.
From the perspective
the volume of transactions, the Asia-Pacific region declined, but
maintained its dominant position, while the North and South American regions
and EMEIA recorded a higher share in the volume of transactions. Sectors
technological, industrial and health were the most prolific in point
in terms of the number of transactions in 2018, accumulating together 652 IPOs

quarter 2018 (326 IPOs and capital attracted of 53.7 billion USD), was
recorded a decrease of 34% in the volume of transactions and 10% in the value of capital
attracted compared to the same period in 2017. Market volatility and
the persistence of geopolitical uncertainties contributed to a sharp decline in
IPO activity in all regions in Q4 2018 compared to the previous quarter, which
which indicates a cautious start to 2019. These findings, as well as others
conclusions, were published in the quarterly report of EY, Global IPO trends: Q4 2018.
The rise of IPO activity in North America and
The South remained in 2018
Thanks to those
261 IPOs with a capital value of $ 60 billion, volume
and transaction revenues in the IPO markets of North and South America have
exceeded in 2018 the values ​​from 2017 by 14% and 16%, respectively. The US maintains that

Asia-Pacific is reaping the rewards
mega-transactions throughout the region
Asia-Pacific a
continued to dominate the overall IPO activity, with six coming from this region
of the top ten stock exchanges in terms of number of transactions and five of
the first ten stock exchanges as income. However, the number of
transactions in 2018 (666 transactions) decreased by 31% compared to 2017,
while the value of attracted capital (USD 97.1 billion) increased by 28%
due to the numerous IPO mega-transactions in the region.





In Japan they were
launched 97 initial public offerings in 2018, a modest increase of 2% a
volume compared to 2017, but representing a significant increase of
333% as the value of the capital attracted compared to 2017. This evolution
can be attributed to the $ 21.1 billion listing of the giant in
SoftBank Telecommunications Corp. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in the middle of the month
December, representing one of the largest initial public offerings
ever registered in Japan, as well as listing the first two companies
""Unicorn"" from Japan.
EMEIA recorded an increase in market share
Global IPO despite the wave of global geopolitical tensions
In the region
EMEIA, number of transactions (432) and value of attracted capital (47.7 billion
of USD) decreased in 2018. The IPO activity in EMEIA decreased by 16%, respectively
26% in 2018 compared to 2017 in terms of number of transactions and value
attracted capital, geopolitical tensions having a clear impact on
IPO activity.
However,
it maintained its position as the second largest IPO market in the world, hosting two
among the top five mega-transactions globally in 2018 and with four
IPO transactions involving ""unicorn"" companies (which have attracted capital in
worth $ 2.7 billion). In 2018, EMEIA recorded an increase of
share of the global IPO market, reaching 32% of the global trading volume
and 23% of the value of the capital attracted. Also, three come from EMEIA
of the top ten stock exchanges, depending on the capital attracted, (Germany,
United Kingdom and India) and two of the top ten scholarships in volume (India
and NASDAQ OMX).
Prospects for 2019: a prudent start, but
an acceleration in the second half of the year
Looking at
In the future, more uncertainties will prevail in 2019. Trade tensions
between the US, China and the EU, the outcome of Brexit and the uncertainties surrounding
the stability of several European economies will continue to exist and in the
the latter, to set the overall tone of the IPO market. At the same time, given
that interest rates are expected to rise in the US, it is possible that the Bank
European Central to feel forced to do the same, which will
influence and IPO activity in the coming quarters.
Although the values
2019 IPO transactions could be lower than those recorded in
2018, global revenues could probably equal or exceed levels
high from 2018, especially if a larger number of ""unicorn"" companies and
several companies in the technological, industrial, consumer products sectors
and health enter the public capital markets in 2019, according
expectations. Cross-border activity is expected to continue
the boom well beyond the beginning of the year, the US, Hong Kong and London
continuing to be the main destinations for IPO activity.

The group is by far the largest oil conglomerate in the world, with oil reserves of 265 billion barrels, or more than 15% of global deposits. The giant extracts more than 10 million barrels a day.



For comparison, Exxon - the world's largest and most profitable listed oil company - extracts three times less daily than Saudi Aramco, while its oil reserves are ten times smaller. By comparison, Aramco's production is higher than the combined production of all US companies, which together extract 9 million barrels a day in this state.



Aramco will be transformed into a holding company



Mohammed bin Salman also stated that he wants to turn Aramco into a holding company and have an elected board of directors.



""Even if we list 1% of Aramco on the market, only 1%, it will still be the largest initial public offering in the world,"" said Prince Mohammed bin Salman.



""We will offer less than 5% of the parent company - we are trying to separate it and make Aramco a holding company"", he added. He also said that the company will be listed on the capital market in Saudi Arabia and one of the ideas studied is the establishment of a fund in the USA to buy shares in Aramco, in order to increase the liquidity on the stock exchange.



The petrochemical and refining empire, partially privatized



A number of the company's subsidiaries could also be listed or privatized as part of Saudi Arabia's efforts to increase revenue from non-oil activities. Earlier, the press wrote that only the subsidiaries of the petrochemical and refining industry could reach the stock exchange. They have a total refining capacity of 5 million barrels per day.



Recently, Saudi Aramco became the owner of the largest refinery in the United States, following a circus-monster with Shell. Thus, following the tensions between the two groups, they decided to split a joint venture, following which Saudi Arabia takes over the refinery in Port Arthur, the largest in the US, with a capacity of 603,000 barrels per day, 26 distribution terminals plus Motiva brand.



In turn, Shell remains two other refineries, with a combined processing capacity of 500,000 barrels per day."
"Crude oil war: Aramco, Saudi Arabia's oil monster, could be listed on the stock exchange worth up to $ 10,000 billion",https://adevarul.ro/economie/business-international/razboiul-titeiului-aramco-monstrul-petrolier-arabiei-saudite-putea-listat-bursa-valoare-10000-miliarde-dolari-1_568fd53737115986c64610d8/index.html,2016-08-01,2022-07-21,"Aramco is considering listing an ""appropriate percentage"" of shares in the parent company or a group of divisions in the downstream segment (refining and distribution), the company was quoted as saying by Bloomberg on Friday.

The results of the analysis of these variants will be presented to the board of directors, which will make recommendations to the Supreme Council of Aramco.



Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman, second in line to the throne of Saudi Arabia, announced Aramco's intention on Thursday in an interview with Britain's The Economist. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is considering listing Aramco as part of a broader set of economic reforms.



The listing comes as oil prices fell from $ 115 a barrel in 2014 to $ 32 a barrel. Saudi Arabia earned $ 285 billion in oil exports in 2014, but in the meantime the price of a barrel of oil has fallen sharply.



The sovereign wealth fund will be exhausted in five years




Saudi Arabia has a sovereign wealth fund of more than $ 670 billion, but revenues have fallen sharply over the past two years, with the budget deficit rising to 20% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Saudi Arabia has launched a ""price war"" with other OPEC member states against US producers of oil from shale oil.

Subsequently, as a result of falling prices, Russia and a number of other states increased their production to offset budget revenues. Russia recently accused Saudi Arabia of destabilizing the oil market.



In October, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that Saudi Arabia could run out of revenue in its sovereign wealth fund over the next five years if the government continues its current policies and the government does not take steps to support public finances,




Huge reserves, production as much as Russia and the USA



The value of the company is very difficult to determine, being able to be anywhere between 1,000 and 10,000 billion dollars, which would make it the most valuable company in the world, according to analyst Jason Tuvey, from the research firm Capital Economics.



Danilo Onorino, portfolio manager at Dogma Capital's investment office in Lugano, Switzerland, valued Aramco at $ 2.5 trillion, a price calculated solely from the company's oil reserves and at a very conservative price of $ 10 a barrel.



The last major listing in the oil sector came a decade ago, when Russia's state-owned oil company Rosneft drew $ 10 billion from the stock market.



Oil reserves alone, about 260 billion barrels, are almost ten times higher than those of the American group Exxon Mobil. Also, the company's daily production of 10 million barrels exceeds the cumulative local production of all US companies. Rosneft, Russia's largest oil company, has, for example, a daily production of 4 million barrels of oil.








The money crisis and the oil war



Even if Saudi Arabia sells only a small part of the company on the stock exchange, the listing could exceed the $ 25 billion IPO of Alibaba Group, the largest in history.



A listing of the company on a large stock exchange is, however, unlikely, given that it should reveal more detailed information about reserves and production, considered state secrets, writes Bloomberg. In addition, the Saudi government has in the past used the procedure to sell shares in state-owned companies to below-market prices as part of wealth redistribution programs.



Apple is currently the most valuable listed company, with a market capitalization of about $ 530 billion.

Competition with Iran



More recently, Saudi Arabia has sharply lowered prices to compete with Iran, with which it has had a smoldering conflict since December, following the execution of a Shiite cleric on terrorism charges. This sparked massive protests in the Shiite world, and protesters devastated the Saudi embassy in Iran. Subsequently, Saudi Arabia, with a Sunni Muslim majority, severed diplomatic relations with Tehran, as did other Arab states.



Investors fear Iran will invade the oil market after lifting sanctions on its nuclear program. At the moment, Iran has an oil production of one million barrels a day, but it wants to increase production by another million very quickly. In 2011, before the imposition of restrictions, Iran's production was over 3 million barrels per day.



In this context, in order to counter Iran's move - which is preparing to return to the European market - Saudi Arabia has reduced the price of its exported oil in order to gain market share.



For example, Italy and Spain relied on Iran for 13% and 16% of oil imports, respectively, before the European Union banned purchases in 2012. Iran was replaced in the market by Saudi Arabia and other countries, such as Russia. , and Tehran relies on the resumption of these links when it comes to exports.



Expenditures for the Saudis, reduction of subsidies and imposition of VAT



To make up for foreign losses, Saudi Arabia has increased fuel prices at the pump by 50 percent for the population, according to CNN Money. Until recently, a liter of gasoline cost the equivalent of 16 cents, the price being among the lowest in the world. Rising fuel prices is just the beginning. The price of utilities such as drinking water and electricity is already on an upward slope.



Authorities have also announced that they will reduce subsidies, which means that every Saudi will be affected by this decision.



Finally, Saudi Arabia and several Arab states in the Persian Gulf area have announced that they are introducing VAT for the first time."

An IPO (""initial public offering"") or an initial public offering is the process by which a company sells some of its shares to the general public, but also to specialized investors. An IPO is often considered synonymous with ""listing on the stock exchange"", because after closing the offer the company's shares will be able to be freely traded on the stock exchange where it took place.




There are many reasons why a company decides to make an IPO, but most of the time the need for financing or the desire of an existing shareholder to liquidate its securities in that company are the main factors that determine a listing. A company can attract financing by borrowing from banks, issuing bonds (practically a kind of loan) or choosing to sell shares on the stock exchange.

The Final Offer Price for the Institutional Investor Tranche is 11 RON/share. The Offer Price for the Small Investor Tranche is: 11 RON/share for a maximum of 1,000 shares subscribed cumulatively by each investor for whom they receive a guaranteed allocation; 10.45 RON/share for the shares subscribed by each investor in the first 5 working days of the Offer Period and for which they do not receive a guaranteed allocation; 11 RON/share for the shares subscribed by each investor in the last three working days of the Offer Period and for which they do not receive a guaranteed allocation. The Offer Price for the Tranche of Large Investors is 11 RON/share,"" states an announcement published on Friday on the Stock Exchange by Raiffeisen Bank, the manager of the syndicate of intermediaries of Electrica's initial public offer .



The final number of shares offered for the tranches of retail investors - both small and large - is 37.209 million titles, the announcement also states.



Thus, retail investors obtained 20.99% of the total volume of shares put up for sale in the offer, of 177.188 million, compared to the percentage of 15% initially allocated in the prospectus.



The price range established in the Electrica offer prospectus was 11 - 13.5 lei/share. At the maximum price of 13.5 lei/share, the amount raised from private investors would have been approximately 2.384 billion lei (543.3 million euros).

Electrica exercised the right to reallocate a package of almost 6% of the shares intended for institutional investors to the tranches of retail investors and announced allocation indices for the shares within the initial public offering.



Large retail investors will receive 147 shares for every 1,000 shares subscribed, while small retail investors who subscribed shares at the 5% discount will get 330/1,000, according to an announcement posted by the offer's intermediaries on the Stock Exchange.



""Electrica has exercised the right to reallocate between tranches (...) The allocation of shares to investors who have validly subscribed in the Tranche of Large Investors and the Tranche of Small Investors will be made based on the allocation indices below (...) the allocation index for the tranche for large investors is 0.1475952193 (...) (respectively) 0.3303339908 for small retail investors who do not receive a guaranteed allocation"", according to an announcement published on Bursa by Raiffeisen Bank, manager of the initial public offering brokerage syndicate of Electrica.



According to the prospectus for the listing, Electrica reserved the right to reallocate a package of up to 5% of the total number of shares offered within the tranche of institutional investors to the tranche of small investors and/or the tranche of large retail investors, if the level of oversubscription is much higher than that registered in the segment of institutional investors. Also, the company may decide on an additional reallocation of the shares offered on the tranche of large investors to the tranches of retail investors, the prospectus says.



""Today we asked the intermediation union to analyze the possibility, taking into account the retail offer, to increase the percentage granted to retail, which was 15%. The intention is to grant Romanian retail over 20%. The brokerage union is analyzing this proposal. We are talking about the biggest listing intention on the capital market in Romania that has ever happened. It is the first privatization that we want to achieve using exclusively the capital market. I am satisfied with the subscription level, a comfortable one. The majority of institutional investors come from Romania, Poland, England and the USA"", said the Delegate Minister for Energy, Răzvan Nicolescu, on Thursday morning.



For his part, Gabriel Dumitraşcu, the general director of the General Directorate for Privatization and Administration of State Participations in Energy, said that Romanian retail will be supplemented.



Initially, 85% of the shares put up for sale were available for the tranche of institutional investors, representing 150.61 million securities and/or certificates of deposit (GDRs) denominated in dollars; 8% of the offer, respectively 14.175 million shares and/or GDRs, were allocated to large retail investors; for small retail investors, 7% of the securities offered were initially allocated, i.e. 12.403 million shares.



Large retail investors subscribed over 120 million shares in the Electrica offer through 953 orders, a request that exceeds 8.4 times the volume put up for sale according to the prospectus for this segment, of 14.175 million titles. The largest order exceeds 3.5 million shares and multiple subscriptions have been entered for more than 3 million shares, according to brokers.



Small retail investors subscribed only 8.271 million shares by order for the guaranteed minimum package of up to 1,000 securities, mechanism limited to 10 million securities.



During the first five days of the offer, small retail investors who subscribed over the minimum guaranteed package of 1,000 shares benefit from a 5% discount compared to the final price that will result from the operation. On the discount tranche for small retail investors, 33.995 million shares were subscribed through 4,473 orders, while the available volume after deducting the securities allocated to guaranteed orders of up to 1,000 shares is 4.132 million shares.



The offer with the 5% discount granted to small investors who subscribed in the first five days of the offer more than 1,000 shares is thus oversubscribed 8.2 times.



Taking into account the previously mentioned allocation indices and the volumes subscribed within the offer, it follows that 17.64 million shares will be distributed on the tranche for large retail investors, while 11.22 were allocated on the discount tranche for small retail investors million shares.



Also taking into account the 8.271 million securities subscribed by small investors by order for the minimum guaranteed package of up to 1,000 shares, it follows that the allocation for retail investors within the Electrica offer is 36.951 million shares, representing 20.85% of the volume total securities put up for sale, of 177.188 million titles.



Thus, about 79.15% of the shares put up for sale will be distributed to the tranche of institutional investors, i.e. 140.237 million titles.



Institutional investors have already subscribed to the shares intended for them since Monday, according to the president of Raiffeisen Capital & Investment, Dana Mirela Ionescu, manager of the Electrica offer.



For retail investors, the subscription price was fixed at 13.5 lei/share, or 16.63 dollars/GDR in the case of large retail investors who opt for this type of subscription, and the final price will be announced depending on the results of the offer. The offer for institutional investors took place in the price range of 11 - 13.5 lei/share, respectively 13.55 - 16.63 dollars/GDR.



The offer through which the state will sell 51% of Electrica shares to private investors began on Monday, June 16, and ended on Wednesday. The company wants to attract at least 435 million euros.



This would be the largest public offer ever carried out at the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BVB), even at the minimum price exceeding the operation through which the state sold 15% of Romgaz (SNG) shares last year for 1.734 billion lei (almost 391 million euros).



Electrica's initial public offering was brokered by Raiffeisen Bank SA, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Societe Generale, BRD and Swiss Capital.

Privatizations in Romania - white balls from international analysts,https://adevarul.ro/economie/stiri-economice/privatizarile-romania-bile-albe-analistii-internationali-1_5278eabfc7b855ff56bcef90/index.html,2013-05-11,2022-07-21,"Privatizations in Romania have always been viewed with reluctance by the public. We moved lightly from not selling our country, in the early 1990s, to privatizations for a leu or a euro, after 1997. Recently we are haunted by a new current similar to the one after the Revolution - United we save. In order to have a strong Romania, to reduce the gap with European partners, the only option is to ensure energy independence, but also to capitalize on natural resources. Along with a few branches of industry (those that remained standing and did not reach the scrap metal) agriculture and the construction of highways, the exploitation of gas and oil in the Black Sea as well as shale gas must be a priority for the whole class. politics, a long-term project with fixed terms, beyond the barrier of the four years spent in government by one or the other.

Romania cannot afford to be passive to economic developments at European and global level. Greece did it and today it pulls the strings - it is not the only one and it has passed the bullet in the ears of others (Spain, Portugal, Italy or Ireland). The government seems to have understood the context and is acting accordingly, relying on the transformation of Romania into a regional pawn on the energy market.

One day, the Executive sold Romgaz shares, worth 30 lei each, through the Bucharest Stock Exchange, as well as global deposit notes on the London Stock Exchange. Both will begin trading on November 12. About 60% of the shares were purchased by foreign investors. The sale of 15% of the shares brought 1.7 billion lei, over the minimum of 1.38 billion lei, the amount attracted is close to the maximum target value.

The Financial Times appreciates the sale of Romgaz shares as the first successful privatization in recent times. The prestigious publication emphasizes that Romania has made the largest initial public offer in history and one of the most important in Eastern Europe. International analysts believe that the initial public offering demonstrates that the domestic energy sector is very attractive to investors, with good development potential. It is also proven that there is money circulating in the local market, but business people take less risk by preferring to place their capital exclusively in places considered safe. British journalists claim that Romgaz is gaining strength through this movement, its subsequent activities will be more transparent, which is also auspicious for state-owned companies to be privatized.

Romgaz's success paves the way for the sale of a minority stake in Hidroelectrica. The most important electricity producer will sell 15% of the shares, also through the stock exchange, the offer being scheduled for July 2014. The news is extraordinary for a company that went through the purgatory of insolvency for a year; today it is making a profit, after in the period 2006-2012 it had a hole of three billion.

Who can buy shares, what amount the state company wants to attract and what the money will be used for",https://adevarul.ro/economie/investitii/nuclearelectrica-actiuni-1_522c9ccbc7b855ff565d9b16/index.html,2013-08-09,2022-07-21,"The listing procedure of the state company Nuclearelectrica begins on Monday, which will last until September 20, this being the first initial public offering in the last five years carried out on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BVB).



Within the offer, Nuclearelectrica wants to sell 25.3 million new shares, representing 10% of the share capital, at prices between 11.2 lei / title and 15 lei / title. The shares are put up for sale at a price almost half of what is registered in the net assets of Fondul Proprietatea, which holds 9.73% of Nuclearelectrica shares.



Following the listing, the company can obtain up to 370 million lei. Specifically, according to the listing prospectus approved last week by the Financial Supervisory Authority, the net funds that will be obtained are between 272.8 million lei and 369.2 million lei, if all the shares offered are sold.



Who can buy shares and how much



During the offer, Nuclearelectrica will make a capital increase with 11.077% of the shares, of which 10% will be listed on the stock exchange, and Fondul Proprietatea will be able to buy 1.077% based on the preference right. Institutional investors have at their disposal 85% of the newly issued shares, small investors can buy 10% of the offer, and individuals who want more than 15,000 shares will be able to purchase 5% of the new securities. Small investors who buy shares in the first three days of the offer have an 8% or 3% discount if they buy securities from the fourth day.



A novelty in Nuclearelectrica's offer is that institutional investors will be able to withdraw their subscriptions during the offer period, while orders placed by retail investors cannot be revoked. The total expenses incurred for the development of the offer are between 9 million lei and 10 million lei and will be fully borne by Nuclearelectrica.



Investment financing



The money obtained by the company from the listing is to be used in investments. The most important is, according to the listing prospectus, a heavy water detritification plant. It will cost 125 million euros.



Other investments worth 64 million euros will be made to increase safety as a result of the Fukushima accident. The burnt fuel depot will also be allocated 52 million euros. In total, investments of 284 million euros are estimated by 2023. In the first half of this year, Nuclearelectrica sold 5.27 TWh, of which 47% went to the regulated market.



A surprise is the fact that Nuclearelectrica is considering to participate as a minority shareholder in the construction of the pumped storage hydropower plant in Tarnita, a project with a value of one billion euros and a capacity of 1,000 MW.



The project from Tarniţa is as old as the one for the construction of reactors 3 and 4 from Cernavoda and is 30 years old. Regarding reactors 3 and 4, a 6.5 billion euro project, Gabriel Dumitraşcu, director of the Privatization Department within the Department of Energy, said on Friday that the state recommended Nuclearelectrica to participate only with the investments already made, without any financial contribution . The project is developed by the company EnergoNuclear, in which Nuclearelectrica owns 84.65%, Enel has 9.15%, and ArcelorMittal Galati another 6.2%.



If until now investors were to receive a share of energy proportional to their ownership in reactors 3 and 4, since the adoption of the new energy law last year, this is no longer possible, and EnergoNuclear will be forced to sell all its electricity on OPCOM, investors will share their profits. According to the prospectus, ArcelorMittal can increase its stake to 11% and Enel to 19%. The state wants to reduce its stake to 40%, thus making room for an investor to take over between 30% and 44%. State officials are negotiating with China Guangdong Nuclear Power, owned by the Asian country.

Nuclearelectrica in figures

The state company Nuclearelectrica registered in the first six months of this year a turnover of 930.5 million lei, increasing by 20% compared to the same period last year, and a net profit of 213.2 million lei, from losses of 33.7 million lei in the first half of last year.




The forecast of a 4% decrease in electricity consumption each year until 2017, made public by Transelectrica last week, warmed the spirits before the listing of Nuclearelectrica. Such an announcement could ""scare"" investors who may be less interested in the securities introduced in the ring of the Bucharest Stock Exchange.



""7-8 years ago they had an estimate according to which consumption will increase by 20-30%. Transelectrica not only has the role of transporting an electron from one point to another in the country, it also has the role of making interconnections "", Gabriel Dumitraşcu accused in a press conference on Friday.



He also said that the price of electricity on OPCOM, the profile stock exchange in Bucharest, is 42 euros per MWh, while in Germany it is 37 euros. But in the southeast, in Turkey, it is 65 euros / MWh, and high prices can also be found in Greece or Italy, countries where Romanian producers like Nuclearelectrica could export their production surplus that cannot be capitalized in the country. due to low consumption.



Daniela Lulache, the private manager of Nuclearelectrica, was not so harsh in her expression: “The decrease in consumption is not such a serious risk for the company. Our production costs are stable and low. The last producers that would be affected are Nuclearelectrica and Hidroelectrica "", said Lulache.



Consumption, from the economy indicator to ""divorce""



Energy-intensive industries are being replaced by low-consumption industries, such as IT or automotive, and energy efficiency projects run by companies and building envelopes are leading to a ""divorce"" between rising Gross Domestic Product and declining electricity consumption, according to Transelectrica .



Energy consumption will decrease by 4% per year until 2017, announced the other day Ştefan Bucătaru, general manager of Transelectrica. For this year, the economy is expected to grow between 2% and 2.5%.



The two entities are controlled by different institutions: Nuclearelectrica is subordinated to Constantin Niţă, the Minister Delegate for Energy, while Transelectrica is in the ""parish"" of the liberal Daniel Chiţoiu, who heads the Ministry of Public Finance.



Energy consumption in the country was used in 2009 by President Traian Basescu to assess the impact of the crisis on the economy. In fact, the former Minister of Economy Adriean Videanu also took the pulse of the economy, during his term, through the country's energy consumption. The consumption forecast for the coming years is vital for any shareholder or future shareholder trying to assess the correct share price.



What happens in case of failure



The listing of Nuclearelectrica is mediated by the consortium formed by the brokerage firms Swiss Capital and BT Securities. The offer will be considered successfully closed if all shares are sold and the company is listed. ""If the offer is not 100% subscribed, the investors will be reimbursed the amounts paid, within 5 working days from the closing of the primary offer, by bank transfer to the account specified by each investor in the subscription form"", it is shown in the prospectus .

Groupon: when chasing success can turn a successful business into a failure,https://adevarul.ro/economie/afaceri/groupon-goana-succes-transforma-afacere-succes-intr-un-esec-1_51470b5700f5182b8522a09a/index.html,2013-18-03,2022-07-21,"In the spring of 2011, some of the brightest minds in technology and business gathered at Groupon's headquarters, which has seen an astonishingly rapid development, to discuss whether or not the organization should prepare an offer. initial public.

The debates took place between Marc Andreessen, the man who created the modern navigator, Mary Meeker, the oracle of the Wall Street Internet, and Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, who was joined by representatives of the Groupon team: CEO Andrew Mason, co-founder Eric Lefkofsky and the organization's European Tsar Oliver Samwer.

Andressen, Meeker and Schultz spoke out against the idea, saying the company still needs to mature and refine its core offerings. Manson was undecided: he wanted Groupon to be very successful, but at the same time he wanted to protect the bizarre culture he built within the company and maintain independence. But Lefkofsky and Samwer were determined. ""They wanted this rocket to be launched and nothing could stop them,"" a source who attended the meeting told The Verge. So, despite warnings from the ""three bright brains"" they hired to receive advice, Groupon has implemented its plan.

Successful IPO beyond expectations

That's how the American company got $ 700 million in November 2011 through the largest initial public offering of a company active on the Internet, according to Google. The stock sold on the stock exchange represents 5% of the company's shares, and the company's value increased to 12.5 billion dollars. Judging by revenue and valuation at the time, it was the fastest growing company in history. But as council members were warned, the organization was not yet ready to appear in the spotlight, writes The Verge in a comprehensive analysis.



The company did not live up to the expectations of Wall Street analysts and began to record higher and higher losses. Moreover, in early March, CEO Andrew Mason was forced to resign, following issues that led to an 80% drop in share prices from the initial public offering.

Whoever replaces him will face a huge crisis, but also an extraordinary opportunity: Groupon is still a leader in sales and customers. But he is struggling to make a profit, and his reputation has been severely damaged and needs improvement.



The biggest obstacle to transformation is Eric Lefkofsky, according to former and current employees. ""Eric is a brilliant guy, but greed overwhelms his intelligence. It makes him make short-term decisions to get as much and as fast as possible. Nor does it bother him if others may suffer, ""said a former employee close to Lefkofsky.



The beginning of the decline



Groupon's first major European acquisition was in May 2010, when it bought CityDeal in Berlin from the Samwer brothers in exchange for a 10% stake in Groupon. After this agreement, Mark Samwer began to deal with the company's operations and expansion abroad, and Oliver Samwer became a close friend of Mason and Lefkofsky, helping to grow the company.



Groupon came to everyone's attention in December 2010, when Google was willing to offer six billion dollars to take it over, which would have turned it into the largest acquisition in Google's history. This was a scandalous offer for a company that had revenues of only $ 30 million in 2009, and any regular start-up would have accepted.



But Groupon refused to sell. Instead, it has spread across the European continent and beyond. If in March 2010 Groupon was not present internationally, there were already 18 countries in it, and by the end of the year it had expanded to 35 nations. But this rapid expansion came at a price: ""Nowhere have I seen worse working conditions at another technology company in my entire career,"" said a source who visited several parts of the Groupon empire.

The downward path that the company has taken with the IPO can be attributed, in large part, to Samwers' influence, writes ""The Verge"". The brothers left the company shortly after the IPO, handing over control of Chicago's operations. But their legacy remained.



The enormous expansion they led has left behind a mess that has had a severe impact on the well-being of the Groupon business. European sales have been the biggest obstacle to development and profit.



In the short period of six months between the offer received from Google and the IPO, the incredible development of the company continued. But everything changed after the IPO, when he had to change his accounting methods.



Groupon is trying to transform from a company that focuses on day-to-day business into a mature company with more assets.



Uncertain future



The new CEO will say a lot about the real health of the business. ""If they manage to attract a big name, this will be a signal to Wall Street that there is still potential,"" columnist Frank Sennett told The Verge.



Lefkofsky is currently trying to get the business back on track. But why doesn't he take over as CEO? ""For Eric, this is a job, and he considers himself a visionary who manages this function,"" added a person who worked closely with Lefkofsky.



How big and how profitable can Groupon become? Prior to the IPO, Lefkofsky said the business was highly profitable, a statement he withdrew, being forced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Although the company provided billions to its first investors, it did more damage to its shareholders, who lost more than eight billion dollars.



""This is a business that helps traders optimize their profits. Fill in the blanks in a theater or meals in a new restaurant. It's not a new Google or a new Facebook yet. It involves a lot of sales, so the margins are lower. Groupon can be a profitable business if managed properly, but it can only be a company of five, six or seven billion dollars "", concludes"" The Verge ""quoting a former executive director."

The company expects to return to a pre-COVID level of performance in the first half of 2022.

Romanian FMCG distributor Aquila raises EUR 74 mln in biggest local IPO in four years,https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-aquila-ipo-price,2021-11-17,2022-07-21 11:47:12.644403,"Aquila (ticker: AQ), one of the biggest distributors of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) in Romania has raised RON 367 mln (EUR 74 mln) in its initial public offering (IPO) on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. This is the largest IPO competed by a private company in Romania in the last four years.
The final IPO price was set at RON 5.5 per share, at the bottom end of the interval targeted by the company. The demand from retail investors was lower than in the previous IPOs carried out on the Bucharest Stock Exchange this year. Still, the tranche allotted to individual investors, which represented 15% of the total number of shares on sale, was 100% underwritten.
“Aquila completed a capital increase of RON 367 million (equivalent to EUR 74 million) through an initial public offering, this being the largest primary public offer made by a company with private shareholding through the Bucharest Stock Exchange. The successful completion of the Public Offer and the trust received from investors give us the opportunity to continue the path of expanding and consolidating the Aquila business to another level,” said Jean Dumitrescu, Investor Relations Director, Aquila.
The new shares sold in the IPO represent a third of the company’s total number of shares after the transaction. Aquila was thus valued at EUR 222 mln, which is 18.3 times more than the net profit reported for 2020 - EUR 12.1 mln.
Local brokerage firm Swiss Capital managed the IPO and BRK Financial Group and Tradeville were distribution agents. Local law firm Schoenherr si Asociatii provided the legal assistance for the IPO.

The company has set a price range of RON 19-21 for its shares in the IPO. The offer will take place between May 24 and June 4 and will have two tranches: one for institutional investors and one for retail investors.
Local brokerage firm Swiss Capital will manage the IPO, with Tradeville and BRK Financial Group part of the distribution group.

On July 12, the company’s shares started trading on BVB at RON 2.14, up 7% compared to the IPO price of RON 2 but closed the first trading day just under RON 2. After that, the share price gradually went down, culminating with a 5.4% drop on Monday, July 19, amid turbulence in international equity markets.
One United closed the trading session on Wednesday, July 21, at RON 1.815, down 9% compared to the IPO price.
The negative price evolution prompted brokerage firm BRK Financial Group to step in and try to stabilize the price through purchases. The IPO’s intermediary can buy up to 7.5 million shares in the first 30 days after listing to counter negative price evolutions. So far, it has bought some 450,000 shares representing about 15% of the trading volume in the respective days.

Electrica IPO: Romanian energy minister talks to EBRD about long term investment,https://www.romania-insider.com/electrica-ipo-romanian-energy-minister-talks-to-ebrd-about-long-term-investment,2014-06-18,2022-07-21 11:47:15.766648,"Romania’s energy minister Razvan Nicolescu had a meeting with representatives of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in London, on Tuesday, June 18, to talk about EBRD’s participation to Electrica’s IPO and the possibility to become a long term investor in the company.
“We expressed our wish and trust that EBRD will be a long term partner for the Romania state in Electrica and that it will use its vast experience to support implementing international corporate governance standards in the company. We hope this IPO will promote Electrica and, implicitly, Romania as a good business destination, as well as stable and predictable for investments,” Nicolescu said.
Romanian state owned electricity distributor Electrica launched, on June 16, an initial public offering (IPO) to sell 177.19 million shares, which make some 51 percent of the company’s capital. The company aims to get between EUR 440 million and EUR 540 million from the IPO.
EBRD might be one of the largest investors in the Electrica IPO. The representatives of the financial institution have already been involved in the making of the new incorporation document for Electrica, and insisted that some clauses be introduced which will not allow the Romanian state to take important decisions for the company by itself, sources from the capital market told Romania-Insider.com.
After the IPO, the Romanian state will remain the company’s main shareholder, with 49 percent of the voting rights, this is why institutional investors wanted guarantees that the state will not be able to take decisions incongruous with the interests of the other shareholders.
EBRD might hold between 5 percent and 10 percent of the company and will have a representative in the company’s administrative board, the same sources said.
The Romanian energy minister and the company’s management, together with members of the intermediation consortium for the IPO, met with EBRD at the start of their international road-show which is part of the IPO marketing to international institutional investors. The road-show will cover all the major financial centers in Europe as well as New York and Boston in the U.S.
The IPO will end on June 25. Citigroup, Societe General, Raiffeisen Bank Romania, BRD and Swiss Capital make the consortium which intermediates the offering.
The small tranche for individual investors in Electrica’s IPO was subscribed in just two days.

This is the third major IPO of a private company on the Bucharest Stock Exchange’s main market this year, after those carried out by local transport group TTS and real estate develop One United.

However, the average price of the distributed goods increased by 27% due to the lower share of cheaper products distributed to HORECA, the company said in its IPO prospectus.

The company will sell 9.41 mln new shares in the IPO, for which it will get USD 527 mln.

Daniel Dines will sell about 1.38 million UiPath shares in the IPO, for which he will get USD 77 mln. After the IPO, he will still hold 109.5 mln UiPath class A and Class B shares, worth USD 6.1 bln (at the IPO price).

Romania's Electrica IPO guide: main benefits for small individual investors,https://www.romania-insider.com/romanias-electrica-ipo-guide-main-benefits-for-small-individual-investors,2014-06-13,2022-07-21 11:47:20.691778,"Small individual investors who will subscribe on the small tranche of Romanian electricity distributor Electrica initial public offering (IPO) will have the option to choose between having their orders guaranteed up to 1,000 shares or getting a 5 percent discount to the final IPO price, according to the prospectus. The procedure, however, is not the easiest.
The tranche for small investors in the Electrica IPO is 7 percent of the total number of shares sold by the company. That is 12.4 million shares out of a total of 177.19 million shares. The price interval for the IPO is RON 11 to 13.5 per share.
Subscriptions for the small retail tranche start at a minimum of 250 shares and go up to 20,000 shares. When making the subscription, investors must pay the maximum price per share of RON 13.5. At the end of the IPO period, which is June 16-25, the price of the IPO will be set based on subscriptions made by institutional investors, who get 85 percent of the total shares.
Retail investors will pay the same price as institutional investors. For example, if this price is RON 12 per share, small investors will get back the difference of RON 1.5 per share.
Small investors who make their subscriptions in the first five days of the offering period (up until and including June 20) will get a 5 percent discount to the final price. Again, as an example, if the price is RON 12, then the discounted price would be RON 11.4. However, investors who choose to have their subscriptions guaranteed do not get the discount.
Investors can choose to have their subscriptions guaranteed up to 1,000 shares. In this case, the advantage is that they know from the start how many shares they will get in the IPO, so the allocation ratio is one on one. A maximum of 10 million shares will be set aside for guaranteed subscriptions, with a first come, first served policy.
It’s uncertain if an investor who wants to subscribe between 250 and 1,000 shares can also choose not to have his subscriptions guaranteed, in order to get the discount. However, in this case he could get significantly less shares than the number he applies for, because the allocation will be pro-rata. So if the non-guaranteed portion of the tranche is five time oversubscribed for example, he will get only 20 percent of the shares he subscribed.
Small investors who want to subscribe more than 1,000 shares also have more options. For example, someone who wants to subscribe 10,000 shares can make two orders, one for 1,000 shares with guaranteed subscription, and one for 9,000 shares non-guaranteed, for which he gets the 5 percent discount. He can also go with a single order for 10,000 shares non-guaranteed.
It’s not the easiest subscription procedure and investors will have to be very careful how they structure their orders in order to get the expected results. Assistance from a broker would prove useful, but even among brokers there are different interpretations given to the prospect. Hopefully all these will be clarified by Monday, June 16, when the offer starts.
Investors in Romania can subscribe in the Electrica IPO through BRD, Raiffeisen Bank and brokerage firm Swiss Capital, which are members of the intermediary consortium. But most local brokerage firms can also receive subscriptions from investors which they pass forward to the syndicate.

"Electrica IPO price to be announced tomorrow, offering starts next week",https://www.romania-insider.com/electrica-ipo-price-to-be-announced-tomorrow-offering-starts-next-week,2014-06-10,2022-07-21 11:47:21.981143,"The price for which Romanian electricity distributor Electrica will sell 51 percent of its own shares both on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BVB) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE) will be announced tomorrow (Wednesday, June 11), following approval from the Government, sources from the Romanian capital market told Romania-Insider.com.
Electrica’s initial public offering (IPO), which shuld be the largest transaction of this kind ever made on the local capital market, is set to start on Monday, June 16, and will close on June 25, according to statements from Romanian state officials.
The company announced its intention to launch an IPO at the end of May. The offer consists of 177 million new shares, representing 105 percent of the company’s total number of existing shares. They include shares and GDRs (global depository receipts), with one GDR standing for four shares, the company announced.
During the last two weeks, the managers of the offering were engaged in the pre-marketing activities for the IPO, which means they contacted potential investors and presented them the company while at the same time asking them how many shares  they would be interested to buy and at what price. Based on that feedback from investors, they established the price range for the offering.
This price range remains to be harmonized with the Government’s expectations, which still requires some negotiations. Following these negotiations, which should end today (June 10), the official price range will be presented on Wednesday’s weekly Government meeting for approval.
The offering price cannot, by law, be lower than the shares’ face value, which is RON 10, which means that the offering will for sure be larger than RON 1.77 billion (EUR 400 million). This will make it larger than the Romgaz IPO last year, in which the Romania state sold 15 percent of the company for EUR 390 million.
After it gets the Government’s approval, the price will be filled up in the IPO prospectus, which should then be approved by the Romanian Financial Supervision Authority ASF. After this step, the prospectus should be made public, either on Wednesday evening or on Thursday this week. The prospectus will be available on the Electrica website, on the Bucharest Stock Exchange website, but on sites of the intermediaries as well.
The consortium which manages the Electrica IPO consists of Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Raiffeisen Bank Romania and Société Générale Corporate & Investment Banking, who are joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the offer, BRD-Groupe Société Générale (Romania) as manager, and local brokerage firm Swiss Capital, as distribution agent.

We are trying to be a pioneer to fill the need for local products that cannot be imported anymore,"" said Jemmy. The high demand for masks is also a solid business prospect in this unfinished pandemic period.

China's economy is strong but its stocks are not -- The Buzz,http://money.cnn.com/2011/01/17/news/international/thebuzz/index.htm,2011-01-17 00:00:00,2022-07-21 11:48:16.108521,"China's economy roars. Why do its stocks stink?





NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The Federal Reserve is taking a lot of heat for QE2 and other easy money policies. But anyone that wants the Fed to start tightening anytime soon should take a look at China to see how well investors react to rising rates.

The Shanghai Composite plummeted 3% Monday, a delayed reaction to Friday's move by the People's Bank of China to boost the reserve requirement ratio for banks. This is the seventh increase since 2009 as China's central bank seeks to cool down its roaring economy.

And Monday's slide is a continuation of a trend. The Shanghai Composite has fallen more than 10% since the start of 2010. At the same time, the S&P 500 has gained over 15%.

That's proof positive that the performance of the stock market isn't often a reflection of economic strength or even the health of corporate profits. It's more about the expectation of where interest rates are headed.

It is an undisputable fact that China's economy is in better shape than the economy of the United States. Gross domestic product in China grew at a 9.6% annualized rate in the third quarter of 2010. GDP in the U.S. during that same period was a mere 2.6%.

But the robust growth in China is creating some headaches, notably worries about inflation and asset bubbles.

China is clearly showing the world that it does not want its economy to overheat. The People's Bank of China is trying for the proverbial (and not easy to engineer) soft landing. Investors are skeptical.

""China's market will only move higher after it looks like inflation has been tamed,"" said Subodh Kumar, an independent market strategist based in Toronto. ""China is taking the right steps but it's hard to say if it will work or if it's too late.""

Interest rate hikes and higher reserve requirements for banks may not be enough though. Some argue that China could better combat inflation by letting its currency (the yuan) trade more freely. A stronger yuan could help lower the cost of many commodities, notably oil and agricultural products.

As fate would have it, the exchange rate issue is expected to be a topic of conversation when China's president Hu Jintao visits Barack Obama at the White House later this week. There are even some calls in Congress to crack down on China and other countries accused of currency manipulation.

Albert Meyer, manager of the Mirzam Capital Appreciation Fund in Tequesta, Fla., is hopeful that China will eventually take even more steps to let the yuan rise because Chinese officials know that's the smart thing to do economically.

The problem, he says, is that China doesn't want to make it seem as if it's being bullied into doing so.

""I think that China doesn't want to be viewed as placating the U.S. or bowing to pressure. But it is in their own interest to allow their currency to strengthen especially since they import a lot of raw materials,"" Meyer said.

Meyer, whose fund owns shares of several top Chinese companies, including China Mobile (CHL), Aluminum Corporation of China (ACH), PetroChina (PTR) and Yanzhou Coal Mining Company (YZC), said that he does believe Chinese stocks should recover once investors feel that inflation is under control.

He warns though that the Shanghai Composite, which is home to many hot Chinese initial public offerings, could be a lot more volatile than Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index. The Hang Seng has actually held up a lot better in recent months despite inflation fears.

Kumar points out that once China's market does recover, it's likely that investors will start wondering about when the Fed will finally begin to consider raising interest rates in the U.S.

For now, few believe any rate hikes are likely until 2012. Kumar said he does worry though that the market is ignoring the recent increase in the price of oil and other commodities and what they say about inflation. That could force the Fed's hand sooner rather than later.

And the drop in China's market should serve as a sobering reminder about what happens to stocks in a rising rate environment.

As much as people like to complain about the Fed at a time when stocks are actually going up, just imagine how much groaning there will be once inflation is a bigger worry in the U.S. and Ben Bernanke & Co. have to react to that by boosting rates.

Q+A - What do China YouTubes' IPOs offer investors?,http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-53203720101203,2010-12-03 00:52:57+00:00,2022-07-21 11:48:16.108521,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s top two online video sites, Youku and Tudou, are set to make their U.S. trading debuts over the next few months.

With similar offerings and near identical business models, here are some questions and answers about the companies.

Earlier this month, Tudou filed for an IPO of up to $120 million, while Youku said it will raise up to $169 million.

WHAT IS THEIR FINANCIAL FOOTING?

YouKu and Tudou are both online video websites that stream video clips to millions of Chinese users. Their main source of revenue is advertising. According to documents filed with the SEC, Youku’s net revenue for the first nine months of the year was $35.1 million while Tudou’s was $33.6 million.

Tudou’s net revenue has grown an average of 317 percent over the past two years and for the first nine months of the year rose 230 percent compared to the same period a year ago.

Youku averaged a net revenue growth rate of over 1,000 percent over the past two years and saw its revenue rise 135 percent in the first nine months of the year over the previous year.

On the cost front, Youku’s total operating expenses and cost of revenues collectively was about a third more than Tudou’s in the first nine months of this year.

For online video sites, a large chunk of their cost of revenues goes to acquiring bandwidth.

In China’s highly competitive and fragmented video space, Youku had a slight lead over Tudou in terms of market share by advertising revenue at 22.5 percent versus the latter’s 18.5 percent in the third quarter, according to research firm Analysys International.

In the nine months ended September, Youku had a net loss of$25 million while Tudou had a net loss of $12.5 million.

Collectively, Tudou and Youku have raised over $200 million in private equity funding. Tudou is backed by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL], Granite Global Ventures and General Catalyst Partners. Youku is backed by Chengwei Ventures, Maverick Capital and Brookside Capital.

IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE IN OFFERINGS, BUSINESS MODEL?

Hardly. China's online video sector is fragmented and highly competitive. Tudou, Youku and Ku6 KUTV.O all offer user-generated content, licensed productions and inhouse productions. They rely on advertising for revenue although Tudou said it might adopt a subscription fee model similar to U.S. online video firm Hulu further down the line.

For their IPO, Tudou said it will use its proceeds to fund the development of its own content, expand its bandwidth and refine its platform. Youku said it will spend its proceeds on investing in technology infrastructure, content acquisition and sales and marketing.

Some analysts were cautious on both Youku and Tudou.

“We are generally a little more cautious on the video names because so far the business model is not very scalable,” said Jin Yoon, a Hong Kong-based analyst with Nomura.

“As you have more users, you need more bandwidth and if you have more bandwidth you have more users. So user access and costs go up hand-in-hand, so there is no scalability in the business yet until we see some advertising dollars ramp up,” Yoon added.

HOW DO THEY STACK UP AGAINST YOUTUBE AND HULU?

China’s online video market by advertising revenue will be worth about 2.9 billion yuan ($436 million) by the end of the year, according to iResearch. By comparison, the U.S. online video market is slated to hit $1.3 billion by end 2010, according to Parks Associates.

Hulu, YouTube and Netflix NFLX.O are dominant in the U.S market and depend on a mix of advertising and subscription fees for revenue.

Sources recently told Reuters that Hulu is considering an effort to raise $200 million to $300 million in a public offering early next year that would help fund its efforts to expand and pay for more content deals.

Hulu’s Chief Executive Jason Kilar also told Reuters this month that the company’s revenue was on track to double this year to $240 million. According to media reports YouTube is due to turn a profit this year on about $450 million of revenue."
Even harder than it looks,http://www.economist.com/node/17046627?story_id=17046627&fsrc=rss,,2022-07-21 11:48:16.108521,"AT FIRST glance, Vodafone has nothing to complain about. On September 8th it sold for $6.6 billion the 3.2% stake in China Mobile that it had bought for $3.3 billion between 2000 and 2002. Such a handsome profit ought to be a cue to crack open the champagne and roast some Beijing duck. Yet the British mobile-phone giant did not get what it really wanted: a way into China. In other countries, Vodafone has had a knack of turning a small investment into a controlling stake, but not in the Middle Kingdom. And it is not alone.

Since the late 1990s, several large state-owned Chinese companies have listed their shares. These initial public offerings typically included “cornerstone” investments by big Western firms. For example, BP, Exxon and Shell (three oil firms) and ABB (a Swiss-Swedish conglomerate) took strategic stakes in PetroChina and Sinopec (two big Chinese oil companies). Alcoa, an American aluminium company, invested in Chalco, a Chinese one. And Western banks bought chunks of the leading Chinese state banks when they were listed.

Foreign firms brought several things to the table: capital, technology, management skills and the prospect of better corporate governance. The Chinese press often referred to them as “elder brothers”. In return, these Western firms wanted access to China's huge domestic market.

It did not work out that way. The Chinese state-owned firms did not need capital so badly that they were prepared to cede control to foreigners. Some also found that the Westerners had less to teach them than they had hoped. “Fly-in” expat managers were often unfamiliar with China, says David Michael, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group. Chinese firms tended to learn more from multinationals that had taken the trouble to build their own large sales forces in China, he says.

Chinese firms no longer feel like little brothers. China Mobile now has a market value half as large again as Vodafone's. PetroChina is much bigger than BP. Both Chinese firms are now rich enough to buy whatever expertise they want.

Western energy companies were quick to notice this shift. BP, Shell, ABB and Exxon all sold their holdings in state-owned Chinese firms by 2005. Alcoa got out in 2007. Financial firms followed, in whole or part, during the financial crisis. When China's state-owned Agricultural Bank was recently listed, no big Western bank bought a significant stake.

Western firms grumble about their failure to turn their stakes in China Inc into a foothold in the Chinese market, but not too loudly, so that they do not annoy the government. Besides, thanks to a rising stockmarket, most made sacks of money from their investments.

A few have not yet cashed out. Telefónica, a Spanish telecoms firm, owns 8.8% of China Unicom and politely rebuffs bankers who advise it to sell. AT&T has 25% of a telecoms business in the Pudong district of Shanghai. Despite regulatory problems, it provides a nationwide service from Pudong, largely to multinational clients. It is a nice business, but a far cry from the dreams some Westerners once had about China."
Don't plant seeds in the AgBank IPO,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-plant-seeds-in-chinas-agbank-ipo-2010-06-15?reflink=MW_news_stmp,2010-06-15 00:00:00,2022-07-21 11:48:16.108521,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Last week, the Hong Kong stock exchange approved Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.'s application for a $20 billion to $30 billion initial public offering.

Hong Kong's approval now makes the Chinese bank's IPO a virtual certainty, and the stock could begin trading on both the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges by mid-July. The deal would represent the world's largest-ever IPO.

I understand how hungry investors are for picks in China right now, as 2010 has been less than fruitful for the country's equity markets after a red-hot 2009. The Shanghai Composite Index is down nearly 22% year to date. So investors should rejoice over the opportunity created by the Agricultural Bank of China IPO, right? Wrong.

While the sheer size of Agricultural Bank of China IPO is impressive, the notion that investors in the United States are going to profit mightily is far less than impressive. Read about the worst IPOs of the last year.

First off, there's the practical question of actually going about buying shares on the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges. Yes, it is possible to buy China-listed stocks from most full-service brokerage firms, but they will almost always charge you a very high premium for conducting the transaction. In certain cases, the high cost of buying Hong Kong and/or Shanghai listed securities is worth the price, particularly if you are buying a high quality company. However as you'll see, I don't think the additional cost justifies the purchase in the case of Agricultural Bank of China.

This brings us to the second reason why I'm less-than enthusiastic about this much-hyped deal, and that is the actual quality of the Agricultural Bank of China. The bank is the third-largest lender by assets of the four existing China state-owned banks, and it primarily concentrates on lending to residents in rural parts of the country. Many of these rural residents are peasants and small farmers, a class of Chinese citizen that's traditionally been much-less financially well off than their urban counterparts.

In fact, some estimates peg China's average urban resident as having about three times as much wealth as the average rural resident. China's rural population also is much less financially savvy than urban dwellers. This lack of aggregate financial wherewithal, along with limited financial knowledge, means that rural borrowers are much more likely to borrow less and default more often. Read about 12 top financial stocks to buy and 12 banks to sell.

The old adage ""follow the money"" is particularly powerful when assessing a bank's business model. In the case of Agricultural Bank of China and its rural lending focus, you might say that it's a bank that's not following the money -- and that's not a good recipe for solid earnings or strong stock performance.

In preparation for the now-imminent IPO, the Chinese government has spent the past couple of years injecting capital into Agricultural Bank of China to shore up its balance sheet. Considering that the company is more than 96%-owned by China's sovereign-wealth fund and its Ministry of Finance, this task wasn't too hard to accomplish. And though the bank has been trying to alter its business model somewhat to seek out better-quality borrowers, I expect the company will face some strong headwinds during any proposed transition. Read about five hot penny stocks for June.

The bottom line here is that I don't think U.S. investors should be planting seeds in Agricultural Bank of China's IPO. This deal may be impressive in terms of size, but it's not an investment likely to harvest much in the way of shareholder profits."

By Sui-Lee Wee and Claire Zhang

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks rose on Friday, buoyed by a bullish outlook from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and a spurt of corporate takeover talk in the financial sector, while foreign-currency-denominated B shares jumped to an 18-month high in China on speculative trade.

SHANGHAI RISES, BUOYED BY ROSY OUTLOOK

China's key stock index edged up 0.46 percent, boosted by the upbeat outlook for the economy and company earnings.

The Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC ended at 3,187,647 points, reversing losses early in the session and securing a 0.7 percent gain for the week.

Gaining Shanghai A shares outnumbered losers by 601 to 270 while turnover rose to 163 billion yuan ($23.88 billion) from WednesSay's 144 billion yuan.

Shanghai's index of U.S. dollar-denominated B shares .SSEB ended up 9.42 percent at 251.192 points, close to its 10 percent daily limit, while volume nearly tripled from the previous day to $326.5 million on the thinly traded market.

Market sources said long-running speculation resurfaced about a possible merger with the far larger yuan-denominated A-share market or a requirement for companies to buy back B shares.

Both moves would likely favour B shares, which are undervalued compared to their A-share counterparts.

Analysts also cited rising expectations of yuan appreciation as favourable for B shares, which are denominated in U.S. dollars in Shanghai and U.S. dollar-linked Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen, while the companies hold yuan-denominated assets.

""Investors could wait to see if any actual policy comes out over the weekend regarding B shares. Otherwise, B shares may be hit by profit-taking next week,"" said Zhang Xiang, chief strategist at Guodu Securities in Beijing.

Official media on Friday quoted Fan Jianping, chief economist with the State Information Centre, as saying that China's economic recovery was exceeding expectations and that full-year growth would be about 8.3 percent. [ID:nSHA79146]

The stock index is likely to rise slightly next week, Zhang said, but added that significant gains were unlikely in the near term, after a sustained rally early this month, and that it would resistance at 3,200 points.

Although ChiNext is tiny when compared with the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges, regulators hope it will eventually compete with Nasdaq and entice more Chinese companies to list with it.

ChiNext is also expected to give a boost to venture capital and private equity markets in mainland China, which have been hampered by a system that until now has not provided investors with what industry insiders call an exit strategy — a way of eventually cashing out of their investments in small companies through a domestic stock market.

There are big challenges to creating a stock board similar to Nasdaq, which includes companies like Microsoft, Intel and Google. For instance, volatile stock prices and high valuations could hurt the new board’s credibility with entrepreneurs and investors.

Chinese investors are known to speculate, favoring momentum buying and selling rather than the underlying fundamentals of a company, analysts say. Indeed, the casinolike nature of the Shanghai stock exchange and the main Shenzhen board, combined with government intervention, have added to the volatility of the mainland markets.

Analysts warn that ChiNext could also be prone to similar speculative frenzies.

Andy Xie, an economist who formerly worked at Morgan Stanley, is already calling ChiNext a “V.I.P. table on top of a big casino.”"
Will IPO market heat up again this year? ,https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2022/07/602_332934.html,18-07-2022,2022-07-21,"IPO-planning companies lower corporate value to appeal to investors By Anna J. ParkWhile a number of big-named companies are awaiting their IPOs during the second half of this year, questions remain whether their listing plans will succeed amid the unstable global market conditions. The first half of the year was a period of disappointment for major IPOs. Despite their initial plans to go public earlier this year, most big-name companies' IPO plans had to be canceled, as seen in the cases of Hyundai Engineering, SK Shieldus and One Store, as they failed to convince investors of their desired corporate value. Putting such setbacks behind, many major companies, such as Hyundai Oilbank, Kurly, SOCAR, CJ Olive Young, K bank and more, are planning to go public during the second half of this year. So far, nearly 50 corporations have submitted their requests for preliminary IPO evaluations to the Korea Exchange (KRX), while a total of 17 companies are currently conducting their book building processes, during which institutional investors' bids are collected. Market experts say that while the global macroeconomic environment still remains unfavorable for listing companies, local IPO market conditions could improve during the second half, as companies wishing to go public are presenting more reasonable corporate value, removing price hype. ""Now we see many cases of companies that had withdrawn from their previous IPO procedures to lower their desired corporate value substantially to proceed IPO plans again,"" Park So-yeon, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities, said. ""Despite the lowered corporate value, these companies seem to put their priority on completing the IPO process this year,"" the analyst added. In addition to many companies offering lower corporate value, the companies are also voluntarily limiting the number of stocks available on listing day, embracing longer lock-up periods. According to a recent report by DB Financial Investment, the proportion of shares available for circulation by recently listed companies has decreased to 30.1 percent this year, from 38.8 percent in 2020 and 33.4 percent in 2021. This decrease means more financial investors of early phases of the firms' initial investment rounds have embraced longer lock-up periods. ""Because of the efforts to reduce the number of available stock on listing day, investment sentiment for IPOs seems to have somewhat recovered by June,"" Yoo Jin-hyung, an analyst at DB Financial Investment, pointed out, adding that subscription competition rates for IPO companies have also been increasing lately. Despite these efforts on the part of IPO-planning companies to appeal more to the market, ongoing geopolitical uncertainties and global concerns over recession have put downward pressure on the local stock market. However, companies that yield solid profits with convincing business models have still succeeded in raising ample capital through going public in the first half of the year. A total of 50 companies went public during the first half of the year; 30 of these, not including SPACs, REITs and KONEX-transferred companies, logged 39.2 percent in profitability as of the end of June, compared to their initial listing prices.

Kakao's move to sell Kakao mobility shares draws protest ,https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2022/07/129_332537.html,11-07-2022,2022-07-21,"  By Lee Kyung-min IT giant Kakao is coming under intense criticism over its plan to sell off over 10 percent of its stake in its mobility affiliate to a private equity fund (PEF), according to industry and firm officials, Monday. Kakao owns a majority stake in Kakao Mobility, the operator of the ride-hailing service app Kakao T, which has an estimated total value of about 8.5 trillion won ($6.5 billion).Kakao characterizes the move as a business strategy to reorganize its corporate portfolio and financials, a much-needed breakthrough to navigate a bout of risks involving a sharp fall in the share prices of the firm and its key affiliates, amid allegations of business overreach at the expense of smaller market players.However, employees of the mobility affiliate call it an irresponsible tactic to altogether dodge accountability for the recent failures in corporate performances and rapidly souring public sentiment. Whether the escalating conflict will dial down remains to be seen, as it will be managed by the Corporate Alignment Center (CAC), a body of Kakao overseeing its subsidiaries. The CAC will hold a meeting with mobility employees soon, according to an industry watcher close to the matter, in an attempt to address concerns about the firm essentially making a hefty short-term profit at the expense of workers left vulnerable to pay cuts and layoffs.

Kyobo gears up for IPO once again,https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2022/07/602_332520.html,11-07-2022,2022-07-21," By Lee Min-hyung  Kyobo Life Insurance has pledged to try again for a long-awaited initial public offering (IPO), after the move was blocked last Friday when the Korea Exchange didn't grant its approval during a preliminary examination.   The exchange operator did not share additional reasons behind the decision, but the ongoing legal dispute between Kyobo and its financial investor ― led by Affinity Equity Partners ― is considered to be the core reason behind the exchange operator's lack of approval.  ""Kyobo makes it clear that we will push ahead with the IPO again after ending the dispute with our shareholders as soon as possible,"" a spokesman at Kyobo said.  Kyobo Chairman Shin Chang-jae Friday attended a meeting of the exchange's listing committee to underscore the need for its timely IPO.  ""About two-thirds of our shareholders are in favor of our listing, and Kyobo is in dire need of the IPO for the firm's sustainable growth and development,"" he told reporters after the meeting.  The Affinity consortium is the Korean insurer's second-largest shareholder, acquiring a 24 percent stake in 2012 for 1.2 trillion won ($921.7 billion). The consortium demanded that the Kyobo chief buy back its shares at 409,000 won apiece by exercising its put option, but the insurer declined to do so, citing excessive pricing.  A put option is a derivative instrument that gives the holder the right to sell an asset, at a specified price, by a specified date to the writer of the put.  Under the put option agreement, Affinity was given the right to withdraw its investment unless Kyobo went public by 2015. After Kyobo delayed its IPO timeline, Affinity ended up exercising the right. Both sides have yet to reach any clear consensus over the valuation of the insurer's pre-IPO stock price.   The case was then brought to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) for arbitration. The authority said that Shin did not have the duty to buy back the shares at the price offered by Affinity, nor did he have to offer any interest payments or compensation to the investor, during the first round of arbitration last September.  The Affinity consortium appealed to the ICC and called for a second arbitration.  Kyobo urged Affinity to stop taking legal measures that block its planned IPO.  ""Affinity should drop any idea of disturbing our IPO plan by engaging in a useless legal battle, and cooperate with Kyobo as its second-largest shareholder,"" the Kyobo spokesperson said.  The Affinity consortium, however, stepped up its criticism of Kyobo, urging Shin to fulfill his responsibility first before carrying on with the IPO. "

Founded in 2005 by hotel housekeeper Lee Su-jin, Yanolja emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the country's ""smartphone boom"" because its mobile-available booking service allowed couples and budget tourists seeking short-term accommodation, who previously had to find such accommodation on-site, to book affordable hotels easily.'Not situated to raise cash from imminent bourse listing': CEO The gradual recovery of tourism will continue throughout this year as more destinations ease travel restrictions and pent-up demand is unleashed, according to an assessment by the World Tourism Organization. In Asia, Yanolja's key target market, an increasing number of destinations have started to ease travel restrictions. With its successful outreach to the cloud business, analysts say that such investors' sense of optimism in the market could help Yanolja remain financially competitive throughout this year. In 2021, it reported 374.8 billion won in revenue, up 29.8 percent, year-on-year, after the company swung to a profit in 2020. Its operating profit last year came in at 53.6 billion won, rising from 10.9 billion won the previous year, it said in a regulatory filing to the Korea Exchange (KRX), the country's top bourse operator. Investors' primary focus is the timing and the location of Yanolja's planned initial public offering (IPO), after the venture capital investment of SoftBank, through SoftBank Vision Fund's decision to invest $1.7 billion in it, the Japanese bank's second-largest investment in a South Korean company after Coupang. Coupang had received about $3 billion from SoftBank before its U.S. IPO. Plus, Yanolja received financial funding from other Korean companies including KT. It secured reaching a corporate valuation of between 9 trillion won and 10 trillion won, according to estimates by local investment banks.

Founded in 2005 by hotel housekeeper Lee Su-jin, Yanolja emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the country's ""smartphone boom"" because its mobile-available booking service allowed couples and budget tourists seeking short-term accommodation, who previously had to find such accommodation on-site, to book affordable hotels easily.   The gradual recovery of tourism will continue throughout this year as more destinations ease travel restrictions and pent-up demand is unleashed, according to an assessment by the World Tourism Organization. In Asia, Yanolja's key target market, an increasing number of destinations have started to ease travel restrictions.   With its successful outreach to the cloud business, analysts say that such investors' sense of optimism in the market could help Yanolja remain financially competitive throughout this year. In 2021, it reported 374.8 billion won in revenue, up 29.8 percent, year-on-year, after the company swung to a profit in 2020. Its operating profit last year came in at 53.6 billion won, rising from 10.9 billion won the previous year, it said in a regulatory filing to the Korea Exchange (KRX), the country's top bourse operator.   Investors' primary focus is the timing and the location of Yanolja's planned initial public offering (IPO), after the venture capital investment of SoftBank, through SoftBank Vision Fund's decision to invest $1.7 billion in it, the Japanese bank's second-largest investment in a South Korean company after Coupang. Coupang had received about $3 billion from SoftBank before its U.S. IPO. Plus, Yanolja received financial funding from other Korean companies including KT. It secured reaching a corporate valuation of between 9 trillion won and 10 trillion won, according to estimates by local investment banks.  The CEO said that while it is watching to time its IPO because its cash-burn rate ― the rate at which a company uses up its cash reserves or cash balance ― isn't at an alarming level, it's not necessary to raise cash from its bourse listing immediately.""We will conduct an IPO eventually. Yes, it's possible. However, we are not in a hurry because the company isn't in the situation of worrying about its cash holdings. We will pursue a bourse listing if necessary. However, the IPO plan could only happen based on our decisions,"" according to the chief executive. ""Our business categories are expanding and because we've reached 'economies of a scale' in our core businesses, the thing we should focus on is how to leverage our business strengths to others."" Kim agreed on the necessity of scaling up its overseas businesses as he said the company is very keen to strengthen its global presence. ""Yes, we will continue to pursue an 'inorganic' growth strategy by scaling up the company's business sizes via mergers and acquisitions (M&As) as Yanolja wants to broaden the company's customer base in target markets throughout acquisition deals."" Backed by the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC and Booking Holdings, Yanolja has been expanding its business to include leisure activities and transport along with hotel bookings. It recently acquired a 70-percent stake in listed Korean e-commerce operator Interpark for $250 million in an attempt to incorporate more lifestyle services that Interpark has built up in the previous years, focusing on the sectors of live performances, shopping and travel tickets, alongside Yanolja's services. In 2019, it picked up the country's Dailyhotel and Indian lodging management platform, eZee Technosys, and in 2018 it acquired Southeast Asia-based hotel chain Zen Rooms.Regarding concerns and legal challenges it may face from its deep-dive into the cloud business because of data privacy and possible legal ramifications, the chief executive said he was hoping to see loosened regulations for the handling of data and data governance in Korea.

ParkFollowing KakaoBank's stock price plunge over the past year, K bank and Toss Bank, the country's two other internet-only banks, are focusing on differentiating themselves from KakaoBank in their initial public offering (IPO) strategies. KakaoBank was the first digital bank to go public last August, meeting success initially. The bank's innovative and accessible platform was evaluated highly, with its market cap once exceeding 40 trillion won ($30.5 billion) in the first few months after its listing on the benchmark KOSPI last year. But the digital bank's market cap shrank to 14.9 trillion won, as of Wednesday, now that the market's initial overvaluation of the bank has faded. While the stock price has nosedived by half since the start of this year, brokerage firms continue to publish analysis reports, lowering their target prices for the bank further.

The two digital banks seem to have realized that a similar IPO strategy to KakaoBank's would not guarantee success for them.   As K bank has officially kicked off its IPO schedule, with submission of a preliminary evaluation request to the Korea Exchange (KRX) at the end of last month ― the first step for the bank's listing on the KOSPI ― the bank plans to emphasize its comfortable service-oriented banking. It is a different approach from KakaoBank's focus on its IT-based digital platform in its IPO strategy. Rather than stressing the bank's digital platform as a key growth factor, K bank has been highlighting the core competency of its banking services. The bank's partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Upbit is also expected to be emphasized, as a way to differentiate it from KakaoBank in terms of growth potential. However, it is uncertain whether the bank's plan to distance itself from KakaoBank's case would succeed in the market's evaluation of K bank's future growth. Given that it usually takes around four months from requesting a preliminary evaluation to going public, K bank is expected to be listed as early as November. K bank was Korea's very first internet-only bank, founded days earlier than KakaoBank in January 2016.

""I would say the fashion e-commerce industry is experiencing the 'valley of death.' Because Musinsa is the only unicorn company in the fashion e-commerce industry in Korea that is reporting profits every year since the start of business operations, investors will focus more on potential returns and I'm sure Musinsa's existing and new business models are good enough to appeal to investors,"" Seo said.The ""valley of death"" is a term widely used in the startup industry, referring to the period of negative cash-flow in the early stages of a venture company before their new product or service generates revenues. More than 80 percent of new ventures that fail to win investors' support end up failing within the first three years. That's because large investors prefer to park their money in business models that are proven and ready to scale, rather than R&D and development efforts.Founded in 2012, Musinsa operates an online shopping mall called ""Musinsa store,"" a fashion magazine ""Musinsa magazine,"" and offline store ""Musinsa store."" As of May this year, Musinsa's is valued at around 5 trillion won, up from 2.5 trillion won just a few years ago, according to officials in the local investment banking industry.The country's top fashion e-commerce platform reached 2.3 trillion won worth of monetary transactions by last year, up 90 percent year-on-year. Revenue in 2021 reached 466.7 billion won, up 41 percent year-on-year, while the company reported 54.2 billion won in operating profit, up 19 percent, it said in a statement to The Korea Times. It has over 10 million users and so far, the company has attracted 320 billion won in investments, including 130 billion won from IMM private equity. Its outstanding growth trajectory stems from its offering of a wider selection of foreign casual brands that were quite tough to find in Korea along with limited-edition items. No change in prime targets, phased global expansion strategy Regarding its brand positioning statement, which could lead to market differentiation from competitors, the marketing chief Seo said Musinsa is attempting to rise as a multi-platform that could include fashion- and culture-centric features.

""Musinsa started with street style, the style of which is a really viral, addictive and instant; however, the evolution of street style is asking us to avoid decoupling between mainstream fashion considerations and fashion style based on individualism,"" according to the executive, adding its recent release of short YouTube ad clips that show its ability for content creation based on the company's persona is aimed at helping a group of youth find ways to gain social validation efficiently as creative endeavors.When asked about the specifics of its initial public offerings (IPO) plan, the plan of which could materialize sometime next year, according to stock market analysts, the marketing chief declined to elaborate. But she said Musinsa is specifically eyeing Japan, countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia for increased market penetration. Key rationale behind its focus on these markets is that K-Pop and Korean entertainment including music, film and TV programs are widely being circulated, a huge plus factor in terms of appealing target consumers with Korean street style clothing inventories.The continued popularity of K-culture is contributing to reshaping consumer behavior in Asia and the popularity of Korean content also means that language is no longer a barrier for consumers watching preferred foreign media content.

""We are reviewing the validity of overseas business expansion plans.

Musinsa earlier scrapped its plan to acquire controlling stakes in its domestic rival, which focuses on Japanese shoppers because the two failed to agree on key conditions regarding the deal. ""We have a subsidiary in Japan. There are influencer groups according to regions and cities.

Musinsa helped it set up an official online store with the availability of Japanese. It launched pop-up store campaigns in major Japanese cities.The executive said Musinsa is hoping to broaden business spectrum from fashion-centric to lifestyle-centric and stressed chances are high as Musinsa is already a ""vertical brand,"" which also has core targets both in markets and age groups. Based on brand recognition it earned from online sales, it wants to deepen its relationship with customers and personalize customer engagement by opening up physical stores, according to Seo.""We are planning to set up pop-up stores in Jeju, September 1 and as a way to show off healthy relationship with partners, we could be able to manage joint marketing campaigns as a fleamarket style.""

Very recently, the global cryptocurrency market saw an extension of volatility even to stablecoins, mostly due to the huge collapse of the TerraUSD, a UST or algorithmic stablecoin, and its sister token, Luna ― which should theoretically maintain a 1:1 peg to a currency and commodity. Plus, because inflation remains too much of a force on central banks around the world, pressuring them to move expeditiously to bring the level back down by raising the benchmark rate sharply, more than 40 percent of crypto holders are now underwater in terms of their investments, according to analysts.All of the numbers are just bad. The price of bitcoin, the benchmark cryptocurrency in the industry, has fallen below $21,000, data shown by market tracker investing.com said. This fall is a major break from the $31,000-to-$32,000 price range bitcoin had gotten into since the collapse of Terra's UST back in early May. This year, Bitcoin's prices have been slashed by over 50 percent of its all-time high of around $69,000 back in November 2021. The crypto market's total market capitalization has crashed to under $1 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.Cryptocurrency analysts have no big fears that the growing inflation or elevated uncertainty regarding the economic climate could persist in the market as core dragging factors. Additionally, the belief that crypto assets offer a hedge against inflation is weakening as recent years' price increases have been thanks to excess market liquidity, which also led to the rise of the major tech stocks listed on the Nasdaq. The point is that both technology stocks and cryptocurrencies are exposed to the U.S. Federal Reserve's and other central banks' monetary tightening concerns. Investors are required to have more patience if they want to give their investments the best chance for profit-taking. Lee Sirgoo, one of the influential figures in the global crypto industry, as he is the chief executive at Dunamu, the operator of the country's largest cryptocurrency operator, Upbit, didn't deny that the crypto market is heading towards being more bearish than bullish. Institutional investors, who have kept their crypto assets in ""cold wallets,"" a type of digital wallet that stores cryptocurrency offline, have started unloading their holdings due to the worsening macro-economic conditions.""Normally, big institutional investors don't store their cryptocurrency assets in exchanges, the amount of which is huge but out of circulation, as they use cold wallets. Amid higher crypto demand, this practice led to the increase in cryptocurrency prices. But they want to prepare for the risks associated to the additional fall in cryptocurrencies by reducing their crypto holdings, resulting in more supply and price fall,"" Lee said in a recent interview at its headquarters in Seoul.The CEO viewed that the cryptocurrency industry is facing ""credibility problems"" because risk contagion in the market is closely connected to such external shocks, which could lead to a ""butterfly effect."" But Lee omitted saying that the continued market tumble could also lead the industry itself to face a structural downturn.""When it comes to blockchain technology, making reward systems visible really matters. For example, if stocks could be issued as a type of coin, imminent transactions could happen 365 days a year and 24 hours a day. I just want to highlight that the technology behind cryptocurrencies is the most efficient way. Yes, it's still very necessary for blockchain network participants to consider a host of issues including the legal structure and governance model of a blockchain. We have three to five years or even more until standards mature and settle. However, everyone is talking about the price trend, which I don't think is desirable, given the potential of blockchain technology in many industrial areas,"" Lee said.While views are mixed over the validity of cryptocurrencies as some are saying that cryptocurrencies and even stablecoins are structurally flawed, as they won't replace normal money, the CEO said he disagrees with this view. Today's expanded role of ""smart contracts,"" tools that can automatically execute transactions once specific conditions are met without requiring the help of an intermediary. They are usually associated with Ethereum, a type of blockchain.""Well, I would say there are some fundamental issues regarding the blockchain transition to the proof of the stake consensus algorithm. But the usage of smart contracts linked to ethereum is being widened and I can see conditions are becoming favorable as an improvement of reward systems is allowing market players to get involved with the release of blockchain-based services such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), some of them are currently used in culture and arts industries,"" according to the chief executive. NFTs are the latest cryptocurrency phenomenon to go mainstream.Terra-Luna crash can't compare to dotcom bubble Could any ""good things"" emerge from TerraUSD's crash? Lee believes so. While he said that the collapse of the Terra stablecoin had caused the industry to see a rapid deterioration of investor sentiment, wiping out more than $200 billion, the downfall is part of the cryptocurrency world's ""growing pains.""

""When it comes to blockchain technology, making reward systems visible really matters. For example, if stocks could be issued as a type of coin, imminent transactions could happen 365 days a year and 24 hours a day. I just want to highlight that the technology behind cryptocurrencies is the most efficient way. Yes, it's still very necessary for blockchain network participants to consider a host of issues including the legal structure and governance model of a blockchain. We have three to five years or even more until standards mature and settle. However, everyone is talking about the price trend, which I don't think is desirable, given the potential of blockchain technology in many industrial areas,"" Lee said.  While views are mixed over the validity of cryptocurrencies as some are saying that cryptocurrencies and even stablecoins are structurally flawed, as they won't replace normal money, the CEO said he disagrees with this view. Today's expanded role of ""smart contracts,"" tools that can automatically execute transactions once specific conditions are met without requiring the help of an intermediary. They are usually associated with Ethereum, a type of blockchain.  ""Well, I would say there are some fundamental issues regarding the blockchain transition to the proof of the stake consensus algorithm. But the usage of smart contracts linked to ethereum is being widened and I can see conditions are becoming favorable as an improvement of reward systems is allowing market players to get involved with the release of blockchain-based services such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), some of them are currently used in culture and arts industries,"" according to the chief executive. NFTs are the latest cryptocurrency phenomenon to go mainstream.  Terra-Luna crash can't compare to dotcom bubble   Could any ""good things"" emerge from TerraUSD's crash? Lee believes so.   While he said that the collapse of the Terra stablecoin had caused the industry to see a rapid deterioration of investor sentiment, wiping out more than $200 billion, the downfall is part of the cryptocurrency world's ""growing pains.""  Regarding questions as to whether he views Terra-Luna event as a ""Ponzi scheme,"" he didn't clearly communicate a definitive yes or no answer. However, he stressed that the Terra-Luna crash would have a limited impact on the market. ""This assessment is based on my belief that the crypto industry will continue to evolve as is it has been doing all along.""""The top noticeable point for the Terra-Luna project is that it doesn't require deposits as it uses a peg approach, which won backing from investors, as this development was viewed as an alternative way to 'stay in cash' without relying on the fiat financial system. Its algorithm design was very creative. But the Terra-Luna crash awakened the need for the industry to have systems in terms of factoring in unpredictability to keep the crypto ecosystem working.""Experts said that the Terra-Luna collapse might prove the catalyst for possible tougher regulation of the industry and may accelerate the new Korean government's efforts to regulate stablecoins. Lee wants to keep lots of communication channels open with authorities handling the crypto-related issues.""I don't think the Terra-Luna crash will play out like the dotcom bubble back in late 1990s and early 2000s. In the dotcom era, attention had too much focused on negative factors. Yes, there were lots of schemes, plots and lies in the early age of the internet business. But these were steps in creating companies that could never be done before. Think about Naver, Kakao and NC. Blockchain technology will also produce new business models. In terms of regulatory framework, I was hoping for regulations to focus more on positive aspects of the industry,"" he said.

"China to fine Didi more than $1 billion for data breaches, sources say",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2125221/media,2022-07-19,21-07-2022,"LONDON: Chinese authorities are preparing to impose a fine of more than $1 billion on ride-hailing firm Didi Global, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, a move that could bring an end to a probe into the firmâs cybersecurity practices.
The people said the fine would be more than 8 billion yuan ($1.28 billion), accounting for about 4.7 percent of Didiâs $27.3 billion total revenue last year. They declined to be identified as the information was not yet made public.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the potential size of the fine earlier on Tuesday.
The ride-hailing firm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Didiâs fine would be the largest regulatory penalty imposed on a Chinese tech company since e-commerce titan Alibaba Group and delivery giant Meituan were fined $2.75 billion and $527 million respectively last year by Chinaâs antitrust regulator.
Alibabaâs fine equated to about 4 percent of its 2019 domestic sales, while Meituanâs was equivalent to 3 percent of its 2020 domestic sales.
Didiâs penalty could pave the way for Beijing to ease a restriction banning it from adding new users to its platform and allow its apps to be restored on domestic app stores.
Didi, co-founded in 2012 by former Alibaba employee Will Wei Cheng and backed by SoftBank Group and Uber Technologies, previously set aside 10 billion yuan for a potential fine, Reuters previously reported.
The company has struggled to bring its business back to normal after angering Chinese regulators by pushing ahead with its $4.4 billion New York listing in June 2021 despite being asked to put the float on hold.
Days after Didi went public, Chinaâs powerful Internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China, launched a cybersecurity probe into the companyâs data practices and ordered app stores to remove 25 mobile apps operated by Didi.
The restrictions have chipping away at Didiâs dominance and allowed rival ride-hailing services operated by automakers Geely and SAIC Motor to gain market share.
The company announced it would delist from the New York Stock Exchange in December, and won its shareholdersâ nod for the plan in May.
Shares of Didi soared in their initial public offering (IPO), giving the company a valuation of $80 billion. It was the biggest US listing by a Chinese firm since 2014.
Besides Didi, the CAC also launched cybersecurity reviews of Full Truck Alliance and online recruitment firm Kanzhun Ltd. July 2021.
Kanzhun and Full Truck Alliance said on June 29 the regulator had given their apps the go-ahead to resume new user registrations."

Middle Eastâs largest optical retailer doesnât rule out an IPO as it expands into lens manufacturing,https://www.arabnews.com/node/2124101/business-economy,2022-07-17,21-07-2022,"RIYADH:Â Magrabi Group, which runs the largest network of optical retail stores and hospitals in the Middle East, is open to a possible initial public offering as it plans to invest SR100 million ($26.63 million) a year over the coming few years to expand operations, including the opening of a lens manufacturing facility in Dubai and possibly a similar plant in Riyadh.The Group CEO, Amin Magrabi, told Arab News in an exclusive interview that some businesses under the group are very interested in the idea of selling shares to the public without revealing the exact time frame of the IPO.Speaking following the launch of his Lens Innovation Center, one of the most advanced facilities in the world and the biggest manufacturer of ophthalmic lenses, Magrabi said, from a valuation perspective, the market is just right to raise funds.âWe are always studying when it is the optimal time to do it. Everyone knows from a valuation perspective that the market is hot now and offers attractive valuations. For Magrabi Retail, I donât see that happening in the next three years. But we are constantly looking at it,â Magrabi told Arab News.ÂHe added: âWhen I look into the future, I see at some point, we will tap the capital markets, but not in the short term. We have no concrete plans to tap the capital markets.âBut the company has already made tremendous strides. Its lens center in Dubai currently produces 1 million lenses annually, and the company plans to manufacture 2 million by 2025.The company has partnered with the top German manufacturer of ophthalmic lens machinery and equipment, Schneider Optical, to develop the facility.The center is the only lens manufacturing facility in the region that utilizes Schneiderâs modulo line technology, enabling the center to run at maximum efficiency levels not seen in the Middle East before.The advantages of the modulo production line are wide-ranging, reducing costs and improving overall efficiency and capacity to world-leading levels.Opened in January 2022, the LIC will serve Magrabiâs premium brand and the companyâs mainstream brand Doctor M.ÂKSA is our biggest market. Our investments will be dominated by Saudi Arabia. So Riyadh is an attractive market for us to look at.Amin Magrabi, Magrabi Group CEOThe firm plans to manufacture a pair of lenses every 15 seconds by 2025, with the goal backed by an investment of 54 million dirhams ($14.7million).Ramping up Saudi ArabiaDuring the interview, Magrabi noted that the companyâs biggest market is Saudi Arabia, and it is planning to ramp up investments in the Kingdom in the next five years.He further said that Magrabi expects to open a similar lens innovation center in Riyadh.âSaudi Arabia is our biggest market. Our investments over the next five years will be dominated by Saudi Arabia. So Riyadh is an attractive market for us to look at. And itâs our largest and fastest-growing market in the region,â he added.Recently, Magrabi Group changed its headquarters from Jeddah to Riyadh, clearly showing the companyâs interest in the Kingdomâs capital city. It is also leading the industry in terms of Saudization.âWe are committed to employing, training, developing and promoting Saudi talent. I think we close this year with 70 percent Saudization in our workforce in Saudi Arabia,â he further noted.Magrabi added that the lens market is also slowly switching to the online selling mode, which will help customers buy lenses from the comfort of their homes.â¢ The company has already made tremendous strides. Its lens center in Dubai currently produces 1 million lenses annually, and the company plans to manufacture 2 million by 2025.â¢ The company has partnered with the top German manufacturer of ophthalmic lens machinery and equipment, Schneider Optical, to develop the facility.â¢ The center is the only lens manufacturing facility in the region that utilizes Schneiderâs modulo line technology, enabling the center to run at maximum efficiency levels not seen in the Middle East before.â¢ The advantages of the modulo production line are wide-ranging, reducing costs and improving overall efficiency and capacity to world-leading levels.âWeâve gone online in Saudi Arabia first and then the UAE. We will go to the rest of the region over the next 12 to 18 months. So now you can get your contact lenses and sunglasses online. But still, to get the best quality measurements, you need to go to the store for the eye test and perfect fit,â added Magrabi.Widening horizonsWith a wide presence of 140 stores across the Kingdom, the UAE, Egypt, Qatar and Kuwait, the group now plans to go premium in the next five years.âWeâre trying to make it more premium. But we do relocate stores. We expand stores, and we put them in better positions.But we donât expect significant growth in those numbers over the next five years. Maybe a 20 percent growth on those numbers,â he continued.ÂâMagrabi wants to emerge more as a lifestyle brand and more as a luxury brand. So you will see massive investments in refurbishments, relocations and expanding some of our existing stores. And this year alone, we will invest over SR80 million to SR85 million to achieve this.âHe also added that he does not want to expand into international markets like regular players who simply open new storesÂ in Western cities.âWhen we go to these markets, weâre not another player who says I have a few stores. We know many people whoâve done that.So, the day we go, we want a significant presence there. Weâre trying to create truly differentiated organizations and business models so that when they grow internationally, they can significantly impact the markets they go to,â he said.While talking about Magrabiâs social commitment, he noted that the group has been operating nonprofit hospitals in countries like Egypt, Yemen and Sudan.âWe have nonprofit hospitals across many Middle Eastern countries that are less fortunate than the Gulf countries. We have constantly invested, donated and supplied care to those in need,â he continued.Magrabi added that the company is eyeing to ensure gender equality in its workforce by 2025.Talking about the measures taken to protect the environment, he said, âWe are using optimal electrical and water usage in our facilities. Starting this year, we will also do some audits to see where we rank and how we can improve on those things.â"

 Metinvest Mining and Metallurgical Group is currently guided by the company's development strategy until 2030 and is developing a strategy until 2050, Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov said in an interview with Forbes-Ukraine.
""Our strategy is calculated until 2030. We are finalizing it until 2050,"" the top manager said, adding that the 2030 strategy has an option to enter an IPO, ""but everything will depend, of course, on our financial burden.""
At the same time, Ryzhenkov noted that there is an overestimation of the advantages of publicity.
""Ferrexpo is a public company, but it is still attacked for being oligarchic and paying little rent. So it is more from the sphere of political technologies ... Thanks to the fact that we have two shareholders, our willingness to IPO is high from the point of view of corporate governance, and from the point of view of reporting. Sometimes the question even arises, why bear the burden of a public company without receiving corresponding benefits. If it was decided to go to the stock exchange, we could do it in a year and a half. Question: what for?"" he said.
At the same time, he clarified that it would be more correct to address the issue of IPO to shareholders.
""As a hired manager, I must be guided by financial and economic logic. The logic of any placement - debt or equity - is quite simple. The company has a development strategy. If it does not have enough money, it primarily uses debt instruments, because it is the cheapest capital. The most expensive is shares. As long as the company is able to serve its development needs through debt markets, there is absolutely no economic incentive to go public. By the way, if Metinvest were a public company, we would have given up investing in Mariupol back in 2014 and everything would have been closed there, because any public investors would say: what $ 150 million investments - they shoot at you there,"" the top manager explained.
According to Ryzhenkov, the largest crisis in the history of Metinvest was in 2013–2015.

Dragon Capital increases assets of funds under management to $800 mln,https://en.interfax.com.ua//news/investments/772179.html,"

Investment company Dragon Capital, one of the leading in the Ukrainian market, currently manages funds with a total value of assets of about $800 million, compared with about $700 million at the beginning of this year, the founder and CEO of the investment company Dragon Capital, Tomas Fiala, has said.
""We continue attracting investors to the funds we create. After EVF (Europe Virgin Fund), we created DCNUF (Dragon Capital New Ukraine Fund) and three more real estate funds. We have co-investors everywhere. We manage these funds ourselves and invest our own funds there,"" he said in an exclusive interview with Interfax-Ukraine.
Fiala said that the share of Dragon Capital in each of these funds is from 35% to 51%, which allows other investors to make a decision on investing much more comfortably.
The head of Dragon Capital also announced plans for the company to remain private. ""We are not planning an IPO or attracting an investor to the Dragon Capital holding. We continue attracting investors to the funds that we create,"" he said, adding that Ukraine remains the main market for investment.
According to Fiala, in the absence of the rule of law in Ukraine and an undeveloped stock market, Dragon Capital is more focused not on portfolio investments, but on investments, where it acts as a majority shareholder – both in private equity and in real estate. ""We have significantly more resources, both physical and monetary, focused specifically on direct investments, and not on trading and brokerage,"" the investment banker said.
Commenting on recent transactions outside the real estate sector, in particular the purchase Aqua-Eco (Truskavets, Lviv region), which extracts, produces and sells natural waters under the Truskavetska trademark, from the international group IDS Borjomi International, Fiala said that this company was put up for sale and was bought after rather lengthy negotiations. According to him, the company has been following this market since the early 2000s, and now has a partner with extensive experience in this area, which has not yet become one of the shareholders of Aqua-Eco.
""This is similar to the story with the bank [recently, Dragon Capital, together with ex-head of Alfa-Bank Ivan Svitek, acquired Unex-Bank], when there is a synergy between us and a specialized co-investor, who in the future will be a minority shareholder and co-managing partner of this project,"" the head of the investment company said.
He confirmed that Dragon Capital still has no plans to enter crop assets. ""If the market were more liberal, we would have considered the option of buying farmland and partnerships with farmers. They would be interested in attracting us as a financial investor. We would buy the land and lease it to them for 20 years. But in the form in which this law was passed, it is not very attractive for us,"" Fiala added.
He also said that he is thinking about investing in the subsoil, but there are still many risks associated with state regulation in this sector. In this regard, Fiala recalled that Dragon Capital remains committed to investing in the industry, ""where there is less overlap with government regulation and with officials, where there are fewer risks.""
He also said that the investment banking department of the company now has many M&A tasks: agriculture, IT and other industries, as well as eurobonds. ""We are planning to participate in another placement of eurobonds in the near future. There are many plans and tasks in this direction now,"" the head of Dragon Capital said.
When asked about the likelihood of a Ukrainian IPO, which has been paused for more than 10 years, Fiala predicted what an initial public offering would be. ""But, more likely, it will be from the IT sector, e-commerce, from some kind of new economy. And it will certainly be on the external market – most likely in London,"" the investment banker said.

Private laboratory market to exceed EUR 1 bln by late 2021 – opinion,https://en.interfax.com.ua//news/economic/768078.html,"
17:12
15.09.2021
",2022-07-21 12:00:09.779052,"

Over 2021, the private laboratory market will exceed EUR 1 billion, Commercial Director of Synevo Mykola Skavronsky has said.
""According to our rough estimates, if in 2019 the private laboratory market in Ukraine was somewhere around EUR 200-250 million, then this year we will cross the figure in EUR 1 billion. The market has now doubled in recent years, that is, it goes exponentially,"" he told Interfax-Ukraine.
According to Skavronsky, ""when this market exploded, many new operators appeared here,"" while existing companies are developing, and regional ones are beginning to ""run over to neighboring and not quite neighboring distant regions.""
He said that in such a situation, one of the main strategies of Synevo is to try to retain the existing market share, ""although we clearly understand that we will lose it.""
""It's hard enough to maintain the same market share when you don't pay doctors. At the same time, we will go into digitalization as much as possible,"" the company's commercial director said.
Skavronsky said that one of the directions of Synevo's strategy at present will be, among other things, strengthening relations with partners, remarketing the patient base, including in the interests of clinics that cooperate with Synevo.
Synevo is the largest network of laboratories in Ukraine, part of the Swedish medical holding Medicover. The Synevo network includes 320 laboratory centers operating in 125 settlements of Ukraine, as well as eight laboratories in which more than 1,000 types of tests are performed.
The laboratory centers of the company serve more than 4 million clients annually.
In 2017, Synevo, as part of the Medicover holding, carried out an IPO on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Thus, Synevo became the first and only medical company in Ukraine which shares are listed on the international stock exchange.
Since 2007, the Medicover holding has invested over EUR 50 million in the development of the company.

"Office of National Investment Council proposes to create state fund of funds, national investment fund with shares of large SOEs for holding IPO",https://en.interfax.com.ua//news/economic/718087.html,"

 The Office of the National Investment Council under the President of Ukraine proposes to create the State Fund of Funds and the National Investment Fund (NIF) with shares of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) for holding an IPO, Head of the Office Olha Mahaletska has said.
""Among the initiatives that are proposed to be considered for the National Economic Strategy of Ukraine is the creation of a National Investment Fund for the transformation of state-owned enterprises, the stakes in which will be under its management, into effective and profitable companies, as well as the State Fund of Funds. It will activate the development of the investment fund industry,"" she said, presenting the Office's proposals to the National Strategy until 2030.
The expected effect of the launch of the State Fund of Funds exceeds 1% of GDP, Mahaletska added.
According to her, the State Fund of Funds invests in other funds instead of directly investing in stocks and bonds of companies. The mechanism of operation is the financing of investment funds that have already received investments from a limited list of first-class foreign investors, such as the EBRD and IFC.
The seed capital of the State Fund of Funds will be the national budget of Ukraine (10-20%) and international financial institutions (IFIs, 80-90%).
Earlier, the government of the country considered the possibility of creating a ""fund of funds"" to support Ukrainian startups on the basis of public-private partnerships. However, instead, in 2019, the Ministry of Finance launched the Ukrainian Startup Fund.
As for the NIF, it is proposed at the first stage to transfer shares of 10-15 large state-owned enterprises to its management, and in the future this number can be increased, Mahaletska said.
According to her, the main task of such an investment fund is to increase the efficiency of state-owned enterprises through the corporatization. In particular, the NIF will be able to appoint its representatives to the company's supervisory boards.
""The task of the highest level is to prepare the enterprise for an initial public offering of its shares on a stock exchange,"" Mahaletska said.
Earlier, Head of the National Securities and Stock Market Commission Tymur Khromaev proposed to create a National Investment Fund, which will include minority stakes in about 20-30 strategic enterprises. The IPO of this fund will increase the investment attractiveness of Ukraine and provide the prerequisites for a successful IPO for these enterprises.
In recent years, the idea of creating a National Welfare Fund has been promoted by the National Securities and Stock Market Commission, citing as an example the successful experience of such a fund in Romania and a number of other countries. However, these proposals were met with no response until recently.

"Investment results of 2020: new companies on the stock market, unpredictability, and records",https://en.interfax.com.ua//news/blog/717798.html,"
15:18
21.01.2021
",2022-07-21 12:00:10.240711,"

Vadym Antsyferov, investor, co-founder & CEO of international companies GoMage and Sellbery
 
2020 was unique and unpredictable from different points of view, including in the context of the investment market. It was impossible to foresee the March collapse of the shares of so many companies. Sales, incredibly high risks - no one was able to understand what would happen next. Those who risked in time were mostly in a winning position because they ""found the bottom."" All they had to do was wait for fear and panic to turn into huge profits.
General market realities
The market rally (steady rise in prices) in 2020 happened in the midst of a disastrous pandemic. It has claimed more than 1.8 million lives in the past year, shut down many businesses, completely destroyed some, canceled mass travel, and damaged economies. At the same time, trillions of dollars were spent on saving the global economy (especially in the United States). This, along with ultra-low rates, fueled the insatiable appetites of greedy investors.
2020 has been a stellar year for the American stock market. But the opportunities that it opened were not applicable to everyone. To use them, one had to have more than just experience in investing. An important role was played by endurance and belief that the market would not only recover but also fix new highs.
Demonstrating market jumps is very simple. The Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index in March 2020 fell to 18,213.65 points, and the S&P 500 index to 2,191.86. The former closed the year with an indicator of 30.421.14 points, and the latter - of 3.756.07, respectively.
IPO boom
In 2020, there was a real boom in the IPO (initial public offering) market. According to Stock Analysis, as of December 30, 480 companies entered the US exchanges - last year there were only 233 of them, that is, half as many.
According to Bloomberg estimates, companies that have carried out IPOs raised nearly $ 180 billion in the US market. Here are some of the most successful examples:

Snowflake, a cloud storage company, went public on September 15. The price for December 31 is $ 281.4, with an increase of 134.5%.
Palantir, a data analytics software company for organizations, went public on September 30, priced at $ 23.55 as of December 31, with an increase of 214%.
Airbnb (an online marketplace for renting private housing around the world), went public on December 9, the price on December 31 was $ 146.8, with an increase of 116%.
DoorDash (an American food delivery service), went public on December 8, the price on December 31 - $ 142.75, with an increase of 40%.

Investor Lessons

The stock market doesn't always reflect the economy
	When the stock bottomed on March 23rd and began to rally, many investors were at a loss. The number of COVID-19 cases has skyrocketed. Restaurants, shops, and theaters have closed, and millions of Americans have lined up to apply for unemployment benefits. How could the market work so well when the world was crumbling?

The fact is that the stock market often begins to recover much earlier than the economy. During the financial crisis, American stocks fell on March 9, 2009. But, while the stock market began to go up after some time, seven years have passed for the unemployment rate to fall below the pre-crisis level.
In 2020, the situation is similar. The stocks have managed to rise to unprecedented records throughout the year. However, many American economists say they do not expect a full recovery of jobs lost during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2023.

Forecasts are just forecasts and nothing more

For the past year, leading Wall Street strategists have forecast and identified the biggest risk in the markets - deteriorating trade relations between the US and China. But trading almost completely disappeared from the radars of many money management experts in early 2020. This topic quickly gave way to concerns about a pandemic and economic downturn.
According to The Wall Street Journal, experts also predicted modest earnings for the S&P 500. By March 2020, analysts at leading wealth management companies BMO Capital Markets and Oppenheimer Asset Management said they were revising their forecasts by the end of the year due to the current market situation. Others cut their targets after the spring sale, only to pick them up again after the summer rally. Investment Bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its year-end numbers to 3,000 in March, then raised them to 3,600 in August and 3,700 in November. The index closed the year at 3756.07.
During a pandemic, no one can know how events will develop, so forecasts simply do not work.

A year of tech giants and incredible discoveries

This is what The Wall Street Journal quite rightly calls this year.
In 2020 Tesla Inc. became the most valuable car manufacturer in the world. And Airbnb debuted on the public market with a score higher than Marriott International Inc., Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., and Hyatt Hotels Corp. put together.
Many tech companies have benefited disproportionately from the pandemic, which has forced people to spend more time at home and online. Just a couple of examples: Zoom Video Communications Inc. grew 396% in a year, which is about 24 times the profit of the S&P 500. And online retailer Etsy Inc. added 302%.

Patience, patience again

Sometimes the best reaction to events is no reaction. Often new introductory, unforeseen realities, which this year were many times more than stability, make investors panic, go the wrong way and lose a lot. For example, starting in February, the shares of many companies could fall by 10-20% in a few days. Needless to say, if one of the most stable - the S&P 500 - in mid-March showed such a downward flight, which has not happened since October 1987 - the so-called ""Black Monday"". Having succumbed to panic that things will only get worse, investors began to sell shares much cheaper than they bought, thus going into a significant negative. But then these same stocks began to rise, sometimes even more rapidly than they fell.
2020 showed that in any situation it is important to be guided, on the one hand, by experience and knowledge, and, on the other, by flexibility and intuition. An experienced investor always has a plan, assesses risks, can stop on time, and react quickly. He can reasonably assess his portfolio - how many risks he currently bears and how to diversify them.
After such experiences and conclusions from last year, 2021 will push many to wake up and see things differently. And this applies to both the stock market and many other economic processes.

Naftogaz CEO: We must not start Naftogaz IPO with Ukrnafta,https://en.interfax.com.ua//news/interview/702826.html,"

Exclusive interview of Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev to Interfax Ukraine news agency
 
Criticism of the company has significantly increased recently. How fair and unbiased are the allegations directed at Naftogaz?
People are well aware of how the company is being transformed. Naftogaz has become the biggest contributor to the state budget, generating huge revenue and supporting the national economy, which is quite obvious when you look at the figures. Prior to corporate governance reform, the company used to be a black hole in the state budget with UAH 85 billion of net losses in 2014. In contrast, Naftogaz Group paid more than UAH 121 billion to the state budget in taxes and dividends in 2019. Despite the fact that the entire industry is currently going through challenging, we are not asking the government for financial support. We are cash-positive, for the time being at least. I fully believe we will remain so. We have a clear growth perspective ahead of us.
The company also makes every effort to continue its transformation internally, becoming more efficient and reliable while continuing to grow. For instance, we are improving our procurement system once more. This process is expected to not only save 10%-15% of our working capital, but also to accelerate our internal logistics. We are developing new businesses, change our operating model, improving communications, and introducing new technologies. This is a complex process, but we understand that we won’t be able to move forward without it.
Nevertheless, the attacks on Naftogaz continue. I think that one of the main reasons for this is the fact that the company is becoming more and more insulated against political influence due to Naftogaz’s corporate governance system, which has proved highly effective. This effectiveness is most immediately evident in recent achievements including successful unbundling, victory in Stockholm, and the new transit deal with Gazprom secured in late 2019. All of these successes were the direct or indirect results of corporate governance reforms, which enable the company to make rational decisions to the benefit of the company and, ultimately, in the interests of the shareholder, which is the state of Ukraine.
Before 2014, attitudes had been different. Naftogaz acted in the interests of a small group of individuals. The company became a black hole whose burden of losses was then shifted to the state budget. In other words, all Ukrainians were expected to shoulder the burden.
We should keep in mind that the people who used to benefit from Naftogaz have not disappeared. They are in parliament and on TV channels. They have access to considerable media resources and enjoy the support of various interest groups, including Russia. This explains why they never miss at opportunity to attack Naftogaz. Our opponents are opportunists. They try anything to undermine the reforms underway at Naftogaz and are always ready to explore new options.
Why is now a good time to attack? 
We are seeing shifts in the Ukrainian political landscape. Earlier, attacks against Naftogaz were coordinated by a single group within government. Now there is evidence of several political forces gaining more weight. New alliances are arising to defend well-established patterns of corruption and political influence.
The first incident was the state audit report, which was leaked and shared with the media. Then, on the day of Naftogaz’s Eurobond issue, a misleading and inaccurate statement was released by the head of the tax office. The tax office claimed to have identified problems at Naftogaz and said they would be imposing a fine. This was a clear attempt to scare off investors. The following day, tax officials came to our offices and requested tax payments.
This not a coincidence. I believe it was coordinated. Our opponents saw a chance in the shape of a power vacuum in central government, so they began attacking us. Even if these attacks do not harm us, they can be used as negotiating tools by the perpetrators. Our attackers go to their sponsors and say, “Well, we have attacked Naftogaz and created a toxic environment. Now we want something in return.”
We now have a situation where, on the one hand, they say to us, “Yes, we understand that it’s nonsense and all allegations are conjured up out of thin air and you need to fight.” But on the other hand, they say, “You are a black sheep. Your corporate governance is an eyesore to everyone, it annoys everybody. No political influence on the company, Naftogaz has it’s own point of view, are you kidding?” We reply that this very point of view generates more than UAH 100 billion annually for the state budget and it has its price. And they say, “Well, yes, it has. But nevertheless, we have our own preferences.""
Another problem is that people who don’t really understand the principles of corporate governance fail to see the connection. Shareholders stand to benefit from offering reasonable freedom and power to make decisions. It is extremely unhelpful when management officials regularly go to the shareholder and ask, “What shall we do? Are we allowed to do this or that?” The most recent example is our financial plan, when we asked for permission to invest at the level of parent company. The plan was not approved and we as a separate legal entity cannot invest in the development of fields for exploration and gas production. The government then takes these fields away from us because we don’t invest. Even when we ask whether we are allowed or not, we often receive no answer. When the authorities block licenses and refuse to grant access to new fields, we do not have opportunities to work. As a result, our shareholder loses. 
Were recent attacks followed by any proposals concerning appointments within the company, amendments to corporate governance policy, or compromises on the retail gas market? 
I have not seen any proposals of this kind so far.
Is the pressure on the company coming from internal or external actors? 
If we look at the media that supported the campaign against Naftogaz, I think it’s a combination of both.
The major problem for Naftogaz arising from the current situation was the cancellation of the planned Eurobond issue. How painful will this postponement be for the company?
We’ll know later. It’s too early to discuss it now. We have a clear understanding of the negative trends on the global market, but the situation in Ukraine is not yet clear. It will be possible to give a detailed and fact-based answer in some time.
How serious is the fact that you failed to exchange bonds maturing in 2022 in terms of liquidity?
We are a liquid company now. We believe that the problem of the canceled bond issue is solvable, and we will manage it successfully.
If everything quietens down, when should we expect the bond issue? Could it be in spring 2021 when a COVID vaccine may appear and energy prices may go up? 
I can’t comment on this.
How plausible is speculation that the audit report is part of efforts to create a negative image of the Ukrainian state in the eyes of the country’s Western partners?
What do you mean? Are you saying that everything produced by the Ukrainian state cannot be trusted and should be thrown in the garbage without hesitation?
Figuratively speaking, yes.
The most interesting and striking thing in this report is that the state auditors believe Naftogaz was not eligible to make provision for doubtful debts. This is very important to Western partners because the government, as the sole shareholder, believes that allowing or prohibiting this provision is at their discretion. This means that the government may assume the right to distort the financial statements of state-owned assets. This is unacceptable. Any state, government, or government agency that believes it can manipulate financial statements will just lose everyone’s confidence, including creditors and investors.
Bad debts are not at the shareholder’s discretion. It is the management’s duty to make the necessary provisions, regardless of the shareholder’s desire, otherwise confidence will be lost. No one will want to deal with a shareholder like that or their companies, especially with regard to funding.
Could this attack by the state audit service be a case of simple incompetence?
I talked to some of the people behind the audit and I wouldn’t say that they are absolutely incompetent. My impression was far from that. Let’s start with the fact that this audit story had been discussed earlier and the first figures were announced by well-known politicians. You can track that in the media. That is why I see a clear political imprint here. According to my sources, there were attempts to exert pressure on the auditors. I think you should ask them who they were discussing the report with, who saw it prior to publication, and who contributed to making this report. Those are very interesting questions that deserve scrutiny.
Do you see any connection between elections in Ukraine and the US?
I don’t see any connection. In the context of the US presidential election, the audit of Naftogaz would not be considered of interest.
One last question on this topic. Is there any effective response to this situation or any investigation?
Yes, we have received some documents saying, “Naftogaz management was acting to the benefit of foreign states and agents during the military aggression in the east of the country.” This wording refers to article 111 of the Criminal Code, which is high treason. They say, “Don’t worry, it’s just a formal investigation, no charges against you.” Well, thank you for these reassurances, but when you mention Naftogaz management, I’m definitely included. I was once fined UAH 8.3 billion, but I don’t remember any high treason cases. It’s a new stage in my career.
Will Naftogaz Group be loss generating in 2020?
I cannot say yet.
 
Ukrgasvydobuvannya forecasts a production decrease in Q4, and there are pending PSO debts. If you take these difficulties into account, Naftogaz Group is unlikely to improve on the losses incurred during the first six months of the year.
Ukrgasvydobuvannya did not generate losses in the first six months. This is important. The problems of the first six months lie in traditional in gas sales, particularly to those customers who received gas under the PSO system and did not pay. Nor do they appear ready to pay. This causes major losses.
As for production and accumulated stocks, we see some rebound in gas prices. We assume that the lion’s share of gas will be sold at a profit during the winter season. If we manage to monetize that gas and receive money for it, Naftogaz’s financial position will be stable. This position will not be extremely good, as heat producers and their collection rates are likely to cause some problems.
As for households and gas retail companies, we are offering our gas to all gas retail companies, but there is one condition they are still unwilling to accept. They must offer either advance payment or payment guarantees. Then they can buy gas at the market price.
Gas retail companies have a huge customer database. We understand that a significant share of this customer database is passive and will not leave their current providers quickly. We also understand that those customers are disciplined payers. The collection rate is close to 100%. Why gas retail companies think that they can collect 100% from households and pay us nothing is a complete mystery for us. We believe it’s not right and we will stand our ground. 
By the way, there is a draft law in parliament suggesting the creation of an auction committee to set the price of gas produced by Naftogaz Group. This repeats the approach to Ukrnafta sale prices. It is a pure copy of the existing scheme whereby a group of officials I’ve never seen before decides the price Ukrnafta will sell its oil. They want to project this onto Naftogaz. They are likely to determine payment conditions too, and we’ll get yet another PSO scenario. There will be a group of companies, which will take gas without payment or pay a minimum price for it, and then they will do whatever they want with that gas.
All the talk about the accessibility of Ukrgasvydobuvannya gas is nonsense. They don’t only need access to Ukrgasvydobuvannya gas, they need access to gas they can avoid paying for. We should call things by their proper names.
By the way, a recent meeting with the prime minister was attended by a large group of private producers who won a competition for production sharing agreements (PSA). They discussed a very interesting question. The government would like to get money instead of gas within PSAs, which is quite reasonable. But all the participating companies refused because there is a risk in our gas market that you may fail to collect money for the sold gas and hence fail to pay the state. This will lead to allegations of stealing gas and under-pricing. Everybody said, “We don’t want it. Take the gas.”
When somebody says producers can sell their gas easily, the market doesn’t support such claims. Selling gas in Ukraine is a complex process related to risks and the ineffective market.
I would like to reiterate that the payment issue was the major cause of Naftogaz’s losses in the first six months of 2020. It’s not about gas price reduction, which we were not obliged to implement, and we were right when we didn’t do it. It’s about UAH 1 billion that was related to price reduction for gas we are to sell in the near future. The price remains the same as it was on the balance sheets. The price has rebounded now. So, most of losses are related to the provision for doubtful debts. I wonder if someone at the State Audit Service heard something about where gas retail companies could spend this money. Naftogaz did not receive UAH 11 billion from companies we were obliged to sell our gas to under PSO. Perhaps it makes sense to hold a state audit of those companies.
Gas retail companies are not state-owned enterprises. This must be a case for law enforcement agencies.
But we don’t see any results. Moreover, the state audit report contains the old reproach from the tax office: why didn’t Naftogaz record all gas sales to its own account and why didn’t the company give nominations to a number of heat producers with substantial debts? What would happen if we followed this logic? We would acknowledge the sales at the PSO price, then calculate VAT and income tax. We didn’t sell. This means that those gas users without nominations were balanced by Ukrtransgaz where gas prices are higher. In other words, they used gas from Naftogaz, but at a higher price. What are the implications for the tax office? More VAT and income tax. What is the tax office saying? It’s wrong. Well, the tax office says the chosen transaction bringing more revenue to the state budget is wrong, and the budget doesn’t need additional revenue.
This story began back in 2016. I am well aware who inspired it. We were managing it for a long time and won the case at the Supreme Court. Now the state audit report says, “Well, we have revised this opinion of the tax office and decided that you were wrong and caused losses to the state budget.”
Do you see any litigation prospects in terms of enforcing gas retailer debts?  
Unfortunately, gas retail companies are dummies. I wouldn’t be surprised if they didn’t even have furniture on the books. Something happened there, and even those guys from the Energy Community Secretariat, who were telling us about unbundling for so long, are not commenting on it. If Naftogaz held a full- fledged unbundling, gas retail companies were not really unbundled from regional gas companies. They have the same shareholder. It’s not only about the Firtash group. It’s about all regional gas companies. Each regional gas company has its own gas retail company, both being owned by the same shareholder. Our opponents say, “But you have the same story with Kirovohradgaz.” Ok, let’s unbundle together. We are ready. We will leave the retail company, it’s our business, and sell the Kirovohrad regional gas company to someone else.
The question is how a “Plunder and Flee” company was granted a right to sell together with a customer database and so forth. The answer is because gas retailers are part of regional gas companies, otherwise they would never have managed that.
With the cancelation of PSO, Naftogaz has not been obliged to sell gas to gas retail companies for household customers at low prices since 1 August. Can we state with confidence that this will have a positive effect on financial statements in Q4 and beyond?
Only if they don’t vote for another legislative absurdity obliging us to do that again. I’ve already mentioned that there is a draft law of that sort in parliament. For now, we are not expecting any growth in retailer debts.
And what about heat producers?
This will depend heavily on the regulation of heat producer–gas supplier relations to be adopted by parliament. I believe the time has come when we cannot backslide. This season, we should adopt a law on powers and responsibilities regarding the management of heat producers. Currently, municipal heat producers, except for state-owned CHPs, are ruled by local authorities. There should also be consolidated responsibility.
Such as guarantees from the local authorities?
There are many mechanisms. It is important to implement the principle of balance between responsibility and power. If a city mayor wants to manage a heat generating enterprise, he or she should also bear responsibility for it. If a heat producer does not pay, then the city must pay for it. Mayors were happy to engage in self-promotion in October, talking about how they were good guys who provided heating to local communities. That’s fine, but please be responsible in terms of payment for the supplied gas.
The only people I hear talking about the introduction of payment discipline for municipal heat producers at the expense of local budgets are Naftogaz sources. Does anyone among the current crop of MPs or ministers support this initiative?
We have discussed it with many MPs. They understand us and typically answer, “We need to find a window of opportunity when it would be realistic to do this politically.” I cannot predict when this window of opportunity will appear. It is important to understand that they can no longer use us financially. We don’t have sufficient funds to sponsor heat producers as we did before, as we have lost gas transmission and transit revenues.
If a city doesn’t want to assume responsibility or cannot do so due to lack of funding, is Naftogaz ready to take control over the relevant heat producers? 
If a heat producer is municipal property, no way. The only case where we are ready to lenc a hand to the government is via state-owned CHPs.
Taking control over state-owned CHPs, as I understand, is to the benefit of Naftogaz, as the company will be able to make sure that the money is not being siphoned off?
During the last heating season, state-owned CHPs owed us nearly UAH 1 billion. Where is the money? I think that CHPs and the State Property Fund should explain this to auditors and law enforcement agencies. We would like to know the answer, too, but we care more about the UAH 1 billion we did not receive. This is a large amount. All this goes towards the provision for doubtful debts. Even MPs say in their explanatory note to draft law No3800-1 that there is no source for repaying those debts to Naftogaz. When our auditors read this, what provision do you think they will set for us? 100%, of course, if there is no source for repayment.
We say to the government, “If you have any other trustworthy company which could manage those CHPs effectively, start paying us 100% and repaying old debts later. We will gladly support this approach. Hugs and kisses. But it shouldn’t be a company like the one which managed CHPs in Novyi Rozdil and Novoyavorivsk before us.
We at Naftogaz have a rational attitude toward the insufficiency of the market. For instance, when we began our saga of production increases in 2015, there were no proper rigs for drilling deep wells. We had to buy them. If there had been a market, we would have rented them instead of buying. But there was no market. For instance, the market of fracking services exists, and we do not buy fracking equipment. If the market exists, we work with the market.
The same is true for CHPs. If there was a company capable of managing them better than we do, give them to that company. We will be happy about that. I have enough work to do. Heat producers are the last thing Naftogaz should be worrying about. But when the management every now and then says they don’t have money to pay, we have no choice but to offer our help in order to ensure full payment for gas.
How realistic is the privatization of state-owned CHPs?
I think it is currently impossible. The reason is simple. The CHPs in question owe us UAH 1 billion. Who would buy CHPs with a UAH 1 billion debt? We cannot waive the debt. The state auditor is very clear about that. Furthermore, we have to charge fines and penalties. Look at the huge debts generated, for example, by the Kryvyi Rih CHP. Any reasonable investor will ask, “Do I need this?”
The State Property Fund says there are some investors that are ready to enter the market. They even mentioned PGNiG.
I called PGNiG and asked them about this, just for fun. We have long-term business relations with them. They inquired what we were smoking and asked us not to make fun of them.
OK. What is the progress in negotiations between the State Property Fund and Naftogaz concerning state-owned CHPs?
At a recent meeting, the prime minister asked for clarity on what we plan to do with CHPs. During the video conference, State Property Fund head Dmytro Sennychenko said, and this was recorded in the minutes of the meeting,  that six state-owned CHPs were fully prepared for the heating season and would be launched in time, everything was OK, and no gas debts. However, I had a different table saying that debts do exist. They promised to repay those debts. As far as I know, there are some discrepancies between the reality and the statement. The situation is not as good as they presented it to be.
Naftogaz’s position is as simple as that. If everything is OK and the collection rate is 90%, or ideally 100%, then we have no questions. We deliver gas, you deliver heat. If you think that the eyes of Naftogaz managers are shining with joy when they are told to take control over CHPs, you are mistaken. But if the government wants to hand those CHPs over to us, we’ll take them. We saw a remarkable thing in Novyi Rozdil and Novoyavorivsk. What was the previous management doing? They used excessive amounts of gas and discharged heat in atmosphere. They did not collect money for heat supplies but sold electricity as much as possible. That was their business model. That is why they are up to their ears in debt, having failed to pay UAH 3.4 billion for gas.
We believe that if a decent management team, who will not steal and will use their brains properly, takes over the running of state-owned CHPs, losses will definitely decrease. Then we can discuss changes to the tariff policy, modernization, or the launch of some satellite businesses like balancing capacity.
To do all that, it’s not enough to just give us control over CHPs. If we know that the facility may be taken away from us, we will not invest in it. We need ownership, then we will invest in CHPs. There are no alternatives if no one can buy them with their huge debts. We understand the situation and are ready to help as partners.
Continuing on the subject of CHPs, does the company really have business plans to develop flexible gas generation based on CHPs?
This plan is being discussed with the government. There are some questionable aspects, however. How much is the market ready to pay for this service? What would be the cost of reserved capacity? We are looking at the green energy business and we have concerns regarding possible claims. Calculations look quite good, but what are the guarantees behind those figures? That is the question.
We understand that sooner or later, Ukraine will have to use flexible gas capacity. Gas is cleaner and faster that coal. The question is whether the market is ready to pay for it. Please explain to us how we will compensate all our costs and earn some margin. We don’t want to hear “it-is-too-expensive” feedback at a later date.
Should we expect PSO to be lifted in the heat supply market next year?
We hope this will happen. This is one of the reasons why we are so open to the option of handing the six state-owned CHPs over to us. Our concern is that they will not give us those CHPs, and investors will not arrive, which will prevent PSO cancellation in heat generation. They are the biggest problem in the heat supply market. If those six CHPs solve their problems, this will remove 80-90% of all problems in the market. Moreover, this would demonstrate that the problems in the heat supply market are solvable.
As a company, we are grateful to the government for solving the PSO issue in the household segment. The government solved it very rationally and courageously. As we see now, the solution was right: no cut-offs of gas supply, the system is functioning, and the market is functioning. They are telling stories that the opening of the gas market for households will cause gas cut-offs, everyone will freeze and die, but this is nonsense. Donetsk region had to use the supplier of last resort. We managed it. The last resort supplier works. We hope that the practice of constructive partnership will continue, as the current economic conditions do not let us live the high life and give away gas for free.
Let’s return to relations with the State property Fund. Given the growth in gas prices, is Naftogaz still interested in concluding a tolling contract with Odesa Port Plant?
Yes, we are interested and ready for cooperation. But we would like to participate in a contest for a long-term contract. They often ask us, “Hey guys, please come and work here,” when the situation is tough, but when it gets better, they say, “Goodbye, Naftogaz. We have another company.”
What term would be acceptable to Naftogaz? 
I think at least a one-year contract would be interesting.
Is it because the company has substantial gas stocks now and it has to do something with them?
No. We believe that the state has failed to generate much profit in this business. We could earn more there and pay more dividends to the state while the Odesa Port Plant could repay its debt to us, which exceeds UAH 2.2 billion.
Does Naftogaz see new business opportunities arising from the opening of markets? For instance, fuel station operators entered the agricultural segment, fertilizers, and retail. As you have capacity, you can deliver additional services.
I believe that retail is a great challenge for us. Naftogaz’s presence in the retail segment was previously insignificant. For our team it means building a new business unit based on new operating principles and rules. This business cannot operate within Naftogaz’s old corporate culture. We are implementing a number of projects now. For instance, we are creating our brand in this segment. For us, as a big producer and former gas transporter who have never operated in the retail segment, it is a tectonic shift in people’s minds to start doing it now.
We must build a customer database. Customers should regard Naftogaz as a company that delivers value. They should choose us consciously. Most gas retail companies just inherited their customers from regional gas companies. It was not an informed consumer choice. As a new player on the market, we must involve customers. To do that, we need to demonstrate the value we can deliver. If we manage to prove that we can deliver more value for our customers than other companies, then we will be able to extend these relations in many ways. That is why we regard relations with end customers as one of keys to our business.
We have achieved some progress, but we cannot say that development is fast. We are operating online so far. Our joint project with Privat24 has been launched recently. It was a long path to reach this point. We hope that another big state-owned bank will start to cooperate with us soon. We have started to work with PUMB bank and received an offline network as well. We don’t want to build our own network as it doesn’t make sense.
When the two-month period of services delivered as the last resort supplier expires, will Naftogaz be able to maintain at least 50% of customers in Donetsk region?
We aim to involve as many customers as possible. What will be the share? I wouldn’t like to make any forward-looking statements. It’s a kind of experiment. The implementation is not smooth. When it is over, I’ll comment on it. But it’s a challenge. Especially in Donetsk region.
Product Sharing Agreements. You’ve mentioned your meeting with the prime minister. Have you managed to achieve a compromise on signing agreements as soon as possible?
PSAs had been discussed even before our meeting at the level of inter-agency groups. Fourteen months have passed, and the PSAs are still not signed. We hope that the prime minister will be able to help us get the ball rolling where the inter-agency commission failed. The major problem with those agreements now is to ensure a balance of interests at the highest level. A sole representative of any of the involved agencies cannot do that.
For instance, the tax office wants more taxes, geologists want to explore more, investors also want to receive more. Striking the right balance is a question that must be decided at the highest political level. I think that the inter-agency commission is unable to do that without the prime minister and the ministers saying, “OK. The balance of interests shall be the following. We give this and we want to receive that in exchange.” And then they should go through everything, point by point. Rotations and changes at the ministerial level have had a negative impact on the process. As a result, there has been no consistent decision-making center. I hope this consistency will appear eventually, and we will be able to sign the necessary agreements.
We had a constructive meeting with the PM. Investors, the government, and Naftogaz officials shared their views and understood each other. I hope this path will lead us to success. Let’s try to achieve it together.
Has the government acknowledged that the previous scheme of approval through the inter-agency commission cannot be effective under the current conditions? 
That’s not quite right. There is another problem. The competition itself contained a number of issues. We warned that the competition model would be troublesome. It would be difficult to sign an agreement based on a competition like that. These assumptions proved to be true. I don’t want to comment on the contest itself. I believe everything that happened back in July 2019 will be revealed sooner or later.
We should now try to use the legacy of that competition to sign a proper agreement ensuring the right balance between the interests of the state and private companies. It’s a very challenging task. Senior government officials need to set the rules for this balance of interests now.
I’ve given you an example. We need to decide on payment. Shall the companies pay with gas or with money? No one in the commission has the authority to decide how. They cannot agree. They say, “Let’s leave two options.”
But two options are the worst-case scenario where we will need to build two systems: one for gas sales and the other for control over gas sales. It shouldn’t be that way. If I were the government, I would want to receive money too, as it means revenue to the state budget. I understand that. But the gas market with its current problems is not completed yet. Considering the GTS Code and other problems, it’s not easy to sell gas. Furthermore, a conflict of interest naturally arises. When a producer sells its own gas, which is the government’s share and whose gas should be sold first? Which customer will it choose for its own gas, and which for the government’s gas? I think the answer is obvious. Each party will pursue its own interests.
All these things need to be resolved. We can then move forward. The government’s intervention was the right step, as there are just two months left. During this period, we need to decide on the principles and the text of the agreement, and then we must sign it.
What about Yuzivka? Is Naftogaz Group interested in this PSA? Is it ready to develop this field on its own or with a partner? 
We are ready to start drilling on our own. If this field is given to us, we will be able to start drilling within six months of signing all the relevant documents.
The conditions of this PSA that were signed with Shell or Slovak Nafta cannot be signed again this time with Naftogaz. Am I right?
I cannot answer this question as we haven’t seen the documents. On 22 October, the responsible agency asked the government for permission to give us the copies. I cannot comment on things I haven’t seen. I hope everything is as they told us.
The story promoted by a well-known group of people under the name Yuzgaz was stillborn from the very beginning. We told them about it, we told everyone about it. You cannot just get assets through a doubtful competition and then resell them. First, they will become toxic, and respectable companies will never buy them. Second, you are unlikely to complete the project. And that was the case. We would like to recall some key facts. Within that field, there happened to be a licensed area of Naftogaz. We happened to drill in that area. Arguably, we are the most competent and transparent operator for the development of the entire field. We had started drilling long before all those events. Fracking, seismic studies by Schlumberger, interpretation and understanding of the new model. There were completed wells there. Finally, we got answers to all of our questions. The idea was to let Naftogaz begin work in order to understand what was there and then give to the entire field to Yuzgaz for free. Of course, I understand that Ukraine is a kind of Wild West in many ways, but not to that extent.
Yuzivka is a very interesting field to test the concept of tight sandstone. Confirming this concept is a big issue for us. We have a working assumption that needs to be checked. Our geologists will say if it’s right or wrong soon.
By the way, many people who worked on this project for Shell continue to do so with Ukrgasvydobuvannya. We hired not only professionals but those who know the site well. We were preparing to develop tight sandstone and we are ready to test this assumption. If the test is successful, I think we will be able to develop the field either on our own or in partnership, if we receive an interesting commercial offer.
Let’s proceed to international litigation. I understand that coronavirus disruption has delayed the decision on Ukrnafta in London?
If you are asking about the dispute with Ukrnafta minority shareholders, there’s nothing interesting or new besides the impact of COVID-19.
As for the case regarding Crimean assets, we have submitted all the relevant materials and are waiting for the tribunal’s decision on whether there will be a hearing or not. 
As for other interesting cases, we have signed a settlement agreement with Karpatygaz.
Have you paid? 
No. We are waiting the enforcement of the agreement in the Ukrainian courts. We need to pass certain proceedings here and receive all evidence.
Can’t you pay without it?
We can. But state auditors will say it’s not correct. They will definitely say it’s not right, though the Ukrainian court says it’s OK.
Now on to Ukrnafta. If will follow if parliament adopts the draft law on payment settlement? 
Nothing has changed here. We will suggest the next step, which is the division of the company.
Under what terms?
The terms will to some extent depend on debt repayment. Perhaps there will be a decision in the arbitration process between the state and minority shareholders by the end of the year. A combination of these two will enable us to negotiate with minority shareholders on what to do next. It doesn’t make sense to hold these negotiations now, as minority shareholders ask only one question, “When are you going to make the first step?” We must therefore make the first step and then we will enter into negotiations and will be able to comment on the terms. We have some ideas, but it wouldn’t be reasonable to put our cards on the table before negotiations begin.
How realistic is the division of licenses from the legal point of view? 
We are working on the legal mechanism. It’s unconventional. You are right to be somewhat skeptical as the licenses were granted to legal entities and so cannot be transferred together with assets. If the assets are divided, we will need to go to the government and ask them to reissue the licenses. The government, however, may say, “No, we want a competition because we want fair and transparent competition everywhere.”
We understand this, but, unfortunately, there are no easy solutions. We will need to look for ways out and suggest them. We have currently established a good dialogue with the state, I believe. It is more constructive in terms of relations with the government: we fulfill some tasks, they give us more and support us. We also hope for a constructive and pragmatic dialogue on this issue. The state has its interests and minority shareholders have their interests. We need to find the right balance and get things done. The problem needs to be solved. At Naftogaz, we want to have an integrated group without toxic elements in order to launch an IPO. It is impossible to do that with Ukrnafta. No way. Frankly speaking, I wouldn’t dare to try selling that to investors. That is why we need to complete the division and move forward.
Which of Ukrnafta’s assets are interesting to Naftogaz in the context of the division? What about the network of fuel stations which is big but not performing well?
The answer is in your question.
I see.
The network of fuel stations as a business is questionable now. CNG (methane) is far more attractive to us.
Has Gazprom ordered additional capacity for November? 
That is confidential information.
The last question is about the ownership policy for Naftogaz approved by the Cabinet and the strategy. They gave you three months. 
I think we’ll keep within the schedule. The strategy is almost ready.

 NSDL initiates talks with investment banks for IPO ,https://www.vccircle.com/nsdl-initiates-talks-with-investment-banks-for-ipo,2022-06-22T20:22:00+05:30,2022-07-21,"National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL), India’s first and biggest depository services company, has initiated talks with investment banks for an initial public offering (IPO) worth ₹4,500 crore, two people aware of the development said. The IPO is likely to be worth at least ₹4,500 crore at a valuation of ₹16,000-17,000 crore, said the second person cited above. An email sent to NSDL remained unanswered till press time. “NSDL has initiated talks on its planned IPO. Most top domestic and foreign investment banks are vying for the IPO mandate and the mandates may be finalized in the next few weeks. The IPO is mostly going to be a secondary share sale by existing investors, while some small amount may be raised as part of the IPO. Most shareholders of the company, including several public sector bank shareholders and other investors in the company are likely to sell part of their shareholding through the IPO,” one of the two people cited above said requesting anonymity. NSDL was set up in 1996 after the enactment of the Depositories Act. As of 31 May, it had over 27.6 million investor accounts, with a demat custody value of ₹297.55 trillion. The depository has a market share of more than 89% in terms of demat assets value. NSDL’s biggest shareholders are IDBI Bank and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), holding 26% and 24% stakes, respectively. Other state-owned lenders State Bank of India, Union Bank of India and Canara Bank own 5%, 2.81% and 2.30%, respectively, while the central government, through the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI) holds 6.83%. Other NSDL shareholders include HDFC Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Deutsche Bank, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance Co. Ltd and IIFL Special Opportunities Fund.  India’s only other depository—Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL)—went public in 2017, raising ₹524 crore in an IPO which was subscribed 170 times. CDSL was set up in 1999. For the financial year ending 31 March 2022, NSDL reported a consolidated revenue of ₹821.29 crore, up 56% from the previous fiscal’s ₹524.30 crore. The company reported a profit of ₹212.32 crore in FY22, compared to a profit of ₹188.55 crore in the previous fiscal.  NSDL’s depository services contributed ₹369.26 crore revenue in FY22, followed by its banking services business which contributed ₹299.24 crore and database management services which brought in ₹92.60 crore.  NSDL’s plans to go public come at a time when demat account openings have exploded due to the post-covid rally in stock markets. After a sharp jump in new demat accounts to 14.2 million in FY21, openings surged further to 34.7 million in FY22. The total number of demat accounts in the country stood at 94.77 million at the end of 31 May 2022. To be sure, demat account openings are expected to slow down this year due to the correction in stock prices and volatility due to global macroeconomic challenges. "

 PharmEasy in talks to raise $200 mn ,https://www.vccircle.com/pharmeasy-in-talks-to-raise-200-mn,2022-07-19T20:22:00+05:30,2022-07-21,"Drug and medical services startup PharmEasy is in talks with investors to raise $200 million, but at a valuation that could be 15% or even 25% lower than last year's $5.1 billion, two people with direct knowledge of deal talks told Reuters. Signalling growing stress in India's startup ecosystem, one source said PharmEasy, backed by big-name investors such as Prosus, TPG and Temasek, is in talks to secure the new funds at a valuation as much as 15% below last year's. A second source said the company, which offers online medicine deliveries and diagnostic test services, has told its bankers to consider even a 25% reduction if needed to close the deal. That could cut PharmEasy's valuation for the new funding round to $3.8 billion, and the sources said an initial public offering (IPO) first targeted for 2022 has been delayed. Indian startups have been jolted by uncertain global and domestic stock markets, and growing investor scepticism over what they say are sky-high valuations, making it difficult for PharmEasy to raise funds at same or a higher valuation, the sources said. They declined to be named as the talks on raising funds were private. PharmEasy's planned fund raising is set to see participation from some existing investors, who have indicated they will commit about $115 million in the new round, said the first source involved in the talks. API Holdings, PharmEasy's parent company which is looking to raise the funds, declined to comment. API owns other businesses including diagnostic test provider Thyrocare. The company had seen its valuation jump in recent years in a boom moment for India's startups in general and a growth surge in its own sector, where rivals include Reliance's Netmeds, Tata's 1mg and Walmart's Flipkart. Last year, Indian startups raised a record $35 billion in private funding and many internet companies went public. PharmEasy, too, cashed in on the boom raised a total of $1.89 billion since 2015, with most of it coming in the last two years, data from Pitchbook shows. Among high-profile Indian startups, a 'down round' deal by PharmEasy's - when a firm sells shares at a lower valuation than before - will be the first in recent times. Bank of America Securities and Morgan Stanley are working on the deal, said the sources. Morgan Stanley declined comment, while Bank of America did not respond. IPO ON HOLD, MOUNTING LOSSES Betting on higher healthcare spends and growing use of online ordering, API Holdings last year filed a prospectus to raise 62.5 billion rupees ($782 million) in an IPO, hoping to list in 2022. The sources confirmed that plan is now delayed. One concern among investors before the market debut is mounting losses of the digital pharmacy, the sources said. PharmEasy's parent saw its total income more than double to $714 million in the fiscal year to March 2022. But total expenses for the period amounted to $1.06 billion, partly due to a one-time employee stock benefits outlay, according to a document viewed by Reuters that listed PharmEasy's latest unaudited financials. The net loss for the year quadrupled to $334 million, the document stated. PharmEasy is currently in a ""wait and watch"" mode and considering listing next year, the first source said. A third person with knowledge of the matter also said the IPO may only take place late in 2023, and PharmEasy's parent may be required to refile IPO regulatory papers. The IPO delay comes as stocks of prominent Indian listings of last year, such as digital payments firm Paytm and food-delivery firm Zomato, have fallen more than 60% from their peaks. "
 HDFC Capital-backed Keystone Realtors files for Rs 850 cr IPO ,https://www.vccircle.com/hdfc-capital-backed-keystone-realtors-files-drhp-to-raise-upto-rs-850-crore-via-ipo,2022-06-13T20:22:00+05:30,2022-07-21,"Mumbai-based Keystone Realtors Ltd, which operates under the ‘Rustomjee’ brand, filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to raise up to Rs 850 crore via an initial public offering (IPO). The initial share sale comprises a fresh issue of Rs 700 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of up to Rs 150 crore by its existing shareholders and promoters. The OFS consists of up to Rs 75 crore by chairman and managing director Boman Rustom Irani, up to Rs 37.50 crore by Percy Soraji Chowdhry and up to Rs 37.50 crore by Chandresh Dinesh Mehta. Keystone proposed to utilize the net proceeds worth Rs 427 crore will be used to repay debt availed by its subsidiaries, towards repayment or prepayment of certain borrowings availed by the company, and funding acquisition of future real estate projects and general corporate purposes. Axis Capital and Credit Suisse are the book running lead managers to the issue. Keystone is backed by HDFC Capital Affordable Real Estate Fund – 3, which currently owns 1.45% in the company. It is not planning to sell any shares as part of its shareholding in the IPO. As of 31 March, Keystone had 32 completed projects, 12 ongoing projects and 19 projects in the pipeline across Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), across affordable, mid and mass, aspirational, premium and super-premium categories, under the Rustomjee brand. It has developed 20.05 million sq ft residential buildings, gated estates, townships, corporate parks, retail spaces and schools. The residential sector, which Keystone focuses on, has seen a sharp recovery in both demand and sales during the course of the covid-19 pandemic, aided by low interest rates, affordability, improved customer sentiment and incentives such as stamp duty exemptions by some states. Last year, Mumbai-based Macrotech Developers Ltd, that sells under the ‘Lodha’ brand and Bengaluru-based Shriram Properties Ltd raised Rs 2500 crore Rs 600 crore via IPO. Another Mumbai developer Puranik Builders also filed draft papers in 2021 for an initial share sale. "
 Skincare startup Mamaearth seeks $3 bn valn ahead of IPO ,https://www.vccircle.com/skincare-startup-mamaearth-seeks-3-bn-valn-ahead-of-ipo,2022-06-21T20:22:00+05:30,2022-07-21,"Sequoia Capital-backed Indian skincare startup Mamaearth is in talks to raise at least $300 million in a planned initial public offering (IPO) next year and is seeking a valuation of around $3 billion, three people with direct knowledge of the company's plans told Reuters Founded in 2016, Mamaearth has become popular in India with its range of ""toxin-free"" products such as face washes, shampoos and hair oils. It competes with Unilever's India unit, Hindustan Unilever, and Procter & Gamble Co in the booming personal care industry. The company was last valued at $1.2 billion in January this year when it raised fresh funds from investors including Sequoia and Belgium's Sofina. Mamaearth is targeting a valuation of around $3 billion - 10-12 times forward earnings based on sales growth and future revenue potential, a person briefed on the discussions said. It plans to file draft regulatory papers by the end of this year, said sources, who declined to be named as the plan is private. Two of those sources said Mamaearth is in early-stage discussions to raise at least $300 million in its IPO, with a third source pegging the number at $350 million. A Mamaearth spokesperson declined to comment on its IPO plans. The company's target valuation for the IPO, and the funds it plans to raise, have not been previously reported. The company is in talks with JP Morgan Chase, India's JM Financial and Kotak Mahindra Capital to appoint them as bookrunners to the deal, the sources added JP Morgan Chase declined to comment. JM Financial and Kotak did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mamaearth's IPO plans come during a broader rout in capital markets and a slowdown in India's booming startup ecosystem that recorded a stellar $35 billion in record fundraising last year. Now, some startups are cutting back on staff and finding it difficult to raise funds, Reuters has reported. Mamaearth was co-founded by Varun Alagh, a former Hindustan Unilever executive, and his wife Ghazal. With the brand endorsed by popular Bollywood celebrities, the duo has cashed in on growing e-commerce adoption in India by offering its products on platforms such as Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart. India's beauty and personal care industry is expected to grow to $27.5 billion by 2025, from $17.8 billion in 2020, Indian financial services firm Avendus estimates. The number of online shoppers for beauty products is also projected to rise to 135 million from 25 million during that period, it added. One equity research analyst, however, said the success of Mamaearth's IPO could hinge on how it plans to rapidly expand into offline sales. Most Indians still go to retail outlets to shop, with e-commerce accounting for just 5-6% of spending. CEO Alagh told the Business Standard newspaper in January that 70% of Mamaearth's sales come from online platforms, but it was targetting a bigger offline presence and aiming to reach 40,000 retail outlets in 100 cities this year. For the fiscal year ended in March 2022, Mamaearth's parent, Honasa Consumer Pvt. Ltd, registered a revenue of $130 million, with a small profit, said one of the three sources. The company recorded a post-tax profit of 246 million Indian rupees ($3.15 million) for the year ended March 2021. "

China slashed the quarantine time for inbound travellers by half in a major easing of one of the world's strictest COVID-19 curbs, which have deterred cross-border travel and resulted in international flights running at just 2% of pre-pandemic levels. Saudi Arabia's benchmark index leapt 2.1%, buoyed by a 3.3% rise in oil behemoth Saudi Aramco and a 3.4% increase in the country's biggest lender Saudi National Bank. Oil prices, a key factor for the Gulf's financial markets, swung higher after China eased quarantine rules, with focus already on tight supply as G7 leaders agreed to study placing price caps on imports of Russian oil and gas. The energy index in the kingdom advanced 3.2%. Dubai's main share index added 1.1%, led by a 1.9% gain in Emirates NBD Bank and a 1.6% rise in sharia-compliant lender Dubai Islamic Bank. Dubai business park operator TECOM Group said on Monday it had raised 1.7 billion dirhams ($462.87 million) from investors via its initial public offering. Over the short term, the market remains supported by the success of Tecom's IPO, according to Fadi Reyad, market analyst at CAPEX.com. In Abu Dhabi, the equities finished 1.9% higher, with conglomerate International Holding climbing 2%, after its unit Alpha Dhabi Holding increased the stake in Aldar Properties and became the single-largest shareholder. Shares of Alpha Dhabi were 2.4% higher, while Aldar advanced 3.7%. The Qatari index closed 1.1% higher, driven by a 2.4% increase in the Gulf's biggest lender Qatar National Bank. Outside the Gulf, Egypt's blue-chip index slipped 0.8%, reaching its lowest since April 2020. The Egyptian bourse continued its slide as international investors' selling trend is still active said Reyad. ""The market could see some support when new IPOs are launched, attracting liquidity.""

Beijing gives initial nod to revive Ant IPO after crackdown cools - sources,https://www.zawya.com/en/world/china-and-asia-pacific/beijing-gives-initial-nod-to-revive-ant-ipo-after-crackdown-cools-sources-b1izo76u,2022-07-21,2022-07-21,"HONG KONG - China's central leadership has given billionaire Jack Ma's Ant Group a tentative green light to revive its initial public offering (IPO), two sources with knowledge of the matter said, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is easing its crackdown on the tech sector. Ant, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, aims to file a preliminary prospectus for the share offering in Shanghai and Hong Kong as early as next month, the sources said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The fintech giant will need to wait for guidance from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on the specific timing of the prospectus filing, said one of the sources. In a publicly released statement, Ant said there was no plan to relaunch its IPO, without elaborating. It did not respond to Reuters request for comment on whether it had received a green light from Beijing. The company's stock market listing was hastily shelved at the behest of Beijing in November 2020. At the time, it was slated to be valued at around $315 billion and planned to raise $37 billion, which would have been a world record. ""Under the guidance of regulators, we are focused on steadily moving forward with our rectification work and do not have any plan to initiate an IPO,"" Ant said on its WeChat account late on Thursday. Neither the CSRC nor China's State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for central leaders, responded to Reuters' request for comment. Ant wants to keep the IPO revival plans low profile pending a formal announcement, after having attracted regulatory glare in its first attempt back in 2020 with the waves the offering created as the world's largest ever equity float, a separate source with direct knowledge of the matter said. Chinese authorities pulled the plug on the IPO and cracked down on Ma's business empire after he gave a speech in Shanghai in October 2020 accusing financial watchdogs of stifling innovation. The IPO's derailment marked the start of a regulatory crackdown to rein in China's huge homegrown technology sector, which spread to other industries, including property and private education, wiping billions off market capitalisations and triggering layoffs at some firms. With its economy slowing in a politically sensitive year when Xi Jinping is expected to secure an unprecedented third term as party leader, Beijing is looking to loosen it grip on private businesses including tech giants to help it meet a growth target of 5.5%, something economists have said will be hard to reach given COVID-19 lockdowns. ""They are rolling back on their crackdown to counterbalance the lockdown they've had. Any data out of China lately has been dreadful because of lockdowns and the last thing they want to do is compound that issue. In the next three to six months we are likely to see China's crackdown unwound,"" said David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital in London. A revival of the IPO may also mark a rehabilitation of sorts for Ma, who has been maintaining a low public profile since Beijing swooped. EASING EFFORTS Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He last month told tech executives the government supported the development of the sector and will back firms pursuing listings at home and abroad. In another sign of Beijing's softer stance, China's ride-hailer Didi Global, which has been under a cybersecurity probe since last year, is in advanced talks to buy a third of a state-backed electric-vehicle maker, Reuters reported on Wednesday. News of the talks comes after the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Chinese regulators are set to conclude their investigations into Didi, which could offer more hope to investors about its recovery. Bloomberg reported earlier on Thursday that Chinese financial regulators had started early stage talks on a potential revival of Ant's stock market debut, without mentioning a timeline. The top securities regulator had established a team to reassess the share sale plans, Bloomberg reported. The regulator later said in a statement it had not conducted any assessment or research work regarding an Ant IPO. The U.S. listed shares of Alibaba, which owns nearly one-third of Ant, were down 7% after earlier rising as much as 7% in pre-market trading on the Bloomberg report. U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus, a big investor in Ant's 2018 private fundraising, lowered its valuation of Ant to about $180 billion at end-March from $221 billion one year earlier, a separate source said. The regulators have directed Ant to restructure as a financial rather than tech firm, and sources and analysts have said the financial sector typically carries lower valuations. Warburg Pincus declined to comment on Thursday. ""The size of Ant and the IPO will have to be smaller than what was planned in 2020 because the market conditions have changed and cannot be compared to now,"" said Dickie Wong, executive director of Kingston Securities in Hong Kong. U.S.-listed shares of Chinese tech and e-commerce firms including Didi and Alibaba have gained this week on hints Beijing's one-and-a-half year long crackdown may be easing.

How Wall Street banks made a killing on SPAC craze,https://www.zawya.com/en/opinion/markets-insights/how-wall-street-banks-made-a-killing-on-spac-craze-f449d3vq,2022-07-21,2022-07-21,"NEW YORK - Investment banks have raked in billions of dollars by feeding the frenzy for blank-check companies, and they have done so largely without risking any of their own money on hundreds of deals that have left many investors with punishing losses. A look at one of these deals shows how. In late 2020, Acies Acquisition Corp tapped into investor demand for blank-check companies – formally known as special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs – with an initial public offering that raised $215 million. Among the investment banks Acies signed up to underwrite the IPO were JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer & Co. When the offering closed, Acies, essentially a shell company, followed the SPAC template. With the cash it had raised, it had two years to find and merge with a private company seeking a stock market listing, or return the money to investors. Acies’ management team announced it was on the hunt for a business in the “experiential entertainment industry.” The team didn’t have to look for very long. Hours after the IPO closed, bankers advising Playstudios Inc contacted Acies managers to tell them the Las Vegas-based maker of mobile casino games was for sale, regulatory filings show. Those bankers were also with JPMorgan. In early 2021, the two companies announced plans for a merger that valued Playstudios at $1.1 billion. In the run-up to the merger and the listing of the combined company’s shares, Playstudios touted a rosy future. It forecast that surging ad sales, a new role-playing game and cross-marketing offerings to game players would bring a 20% rise in revenue in 2021 and a 33% jump this year. Since then, the company has scrapped the new game, and revenue fell far short of predictions. Retail investors suffered the consequences. The stock is down more than 50% since shareholders approved the merger last June. “Playstudios is one that looks like crap right now,” Dan Ushman, a 37-year-old Chicago-area entrepreneur, said earlier this year. He put about $26,000 into Acies after it announced its deal with Playstudios and soon saw his investment drop more than 35%. Investment banks involved in the deal fared much better, having risked none of their own money, based on a Reuters review of regulatory filings. JPMorgan, in particular, pocketed hefty fees for its dual role as an underwriter for the Acies IPO and as an adviser to Playstudios – perfectly legal, despite the apparent conflict of interest, if the bank discloses its role, as JPMorgan did. The bank has not disclosed its fees, but financial data provider Refinitiv estimates that JPMorgan earned $4.7 million in underwriting fees and $14.2 million as a sell-side adviser. It also received $1.6 million for helping Acies raise additional capital through a maneuver known as private investment in public equity, or PIPE, according to financial research firm Morningstar Inc and a Reuters analysis. PIPEs, which tap big institutional investors, are often necessary to close a SPAC merger. Morgan Stanley earned about $5.9 million and Oppenheimer about $1.2 million in underwriting fees, according to Refinitiv estimates. Each bank also got about $1.6 million in PIPE-related fees, according to Morningstar and a Reuters analysis. LionTree Advisors, another Playstudios adviser, earned $6.2 million on the deal, according to Refinitiv estimates, plus $1.6 million in PIPE fees, according to Morningstar and a Reuters analysis. JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and LionTree declined to comment. An Oppenheimer spokesman said the bank had a minor role in the Acies IPO. Playstudios noted that the JPMorgan teams it and Acies worked with came from separate divisions of the bank. The company said it has “a robust framework for evaluating, approving, executing and optimizing its game initiatives,” and that it is continually “revisiting the conditions and decision to either advance or suspend an initiative.” A CURIOUS PATTERN The disparate outcomes of the Acies-Playstudios deal – big bucks for the investment banks that sold it and big losses for retail investors who bought into it – are typical of many SPAC deals. For this article, Reuters analyzed hundreds of SPACs spanning roughly two years, reviewed banks’ internal documents and regulatory filings, and interviewed more than two dozen bankers, investors, SPAC managers, lawyers and corporate executives. The examination found that investment banks turbocharged to their benefit what turned out to be a speculative bubble in companies that have often failed to live up to their pre-listing hype. The SPAC market has sagged since the collapse of some high-profile blank-check listings amid overall grim market conditions. And in March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed new rules that would increase disclosure requirements and potential legal liability for SPACs and their banks. Facing these market and regulatory challenges, some banks have been pulling back from the business. Whatever happens to the SPAC market, the Reuters examination reveals in detail for the first time how, over the past couple of years, Wall Street banks have enriched themselves by aggressively promoting the deals in the absence of the legal guardrails and financial risks associated with traditional IPOs. Credit Suisse summed it up last year in a confidential client presentation reviewed by Reuters: SPACs “bend the rules” of the IPO market. The Swiss bank has had a role in 136 blank-check deals since the beginning of 2020 through the end of March, according to a Reuters analysis of SPAC Research data. A Credit Suisse spokesperson said the language in the presentation pertains to SPAC “market conventions” that give companies and investors more flexibility than in traditional IPOs. The bank is committed to “recommending strategies that conform to all applicable rules,” the spokesperson said. In a traditional IPO, underwriters can be held responsible under securities law for any misleading forecasts, projections or other statements made to investors. To protect themselves against liability, banks perform rigorous due diligence on companies whose IPOs they underwrite, and those companies generally do not issue public forecasts about their performance. Banks also buy big chunks of an issuing company’s new shares, risking losses if they can’t resell the stock for more than they paid. With a SPAC, a bank's role as underwriter ends once the blank-check company completes its IPO, but the bank receives a portion of its fee only after the SPAC makes an acquisition. By the time the SPAC announces a merger, SPAC underwriters aren’t responsible for forecasts and other claims about the performance of the company to be acquired and publicly listed. And because blank-check IPOs are typically priced at a nominal $10, banks don't run the risk of having to sell new shares that fall in value. For investment banks, blank-check deals create “moral hazard” – an incentive to take on risk because of little exposure to it – according to Usha Rodrigues, a law professor at the University of Georgia who studies SPACs. That’s because they “don’t have the same liability with a SPAC that they have with a traditional IPO, but banks do get to collect fees if they can get a deal done,” she said. The “companies that merged with SPACs … don’t have the same level of vetting,” which most retail investors do not realize. Shares of companies that obtained a stock market listing in a SPAC merger from 2019 through the beginning of March were down roughly 36% on average from when their deals closed, according to data provided by Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida. That’s even worse than the 14% decline in shares of companies that went public through traditional IPOs during the same period, according to Nasdaq Inc. All told, according to Vanda Research, retail investors lost $4.8 billion, or 23%, of the aggregate $21.3 billion they plowed into SPACs from the beginning of 2020 to the first week of April 2022. Yet the deals that brought those shares to market have yielded a bonanza for investment banks. Industry tracker Coalition Greenwich estimates that banks booked about $8 billion in SPAC-related fees in 2020 and 2021. That represents roughly 6.5% of total U.S. investment banking fees that major banks collected in that period, according to Coalition Greenwich. “The bank has an incentive to push the deal to get closed, at any price, because they want their 3.5% of the SPAC IPO proceeds,” said Mike Stegemoller, a professor of banking and finance at Baylor University, referring to the fees underwriters receive only after a SPAC merger closes. “I think the conflict is with retail investors who are buying common shares of stock … Do you really think banks care about these retail investors? I think there are good incentives not to.” Many banks amped up their take by working for both sides of deals, as JPMorgan did with Acies and Playstudios. Reuters identified roughly 50 such cases from early 2020 to November 2021. SOURED SENTIMENT As the SPAC bubble has deflated, debate over responsibility for investor losses has focused on the executives of blank-check companies. These founding investors – referred to as sponsors – risk losing all of their investment if they can’t find a company to take public through a merger within the two-year window. However, founders acquire their shares at deep discounts to the typical $10 offering price, thanks to preferential treatment and fees that can dilute retail investors’ holdings. Likewise, the hedge funds and other institutional investors that account for a lot of the money behind SPACs often obtain their shares in an IPO or subsequent PIPE under favorable terms that put them at an advantage relative to retail investors. The SEC put SPACs on notice last year with several enforcement actions against specific companies and their sponsors for allegedly misleading investors about their prospects. Then, in late March, the regulator announced its proposed rules, which would, among other things, establish that investment banks that underwrite SPACs could be held legally liable for false or misleading forecasts or statements about blank-check deals. The SEC will vote on the rules after the public-comment period ends later this spring. The SEC declined to comment. In a March 30 statement on the proposed rules, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said “gatekeepers” such as underwriters “should have to stand behind and be responsible for basic aspects of their work” and “provide an essential function to police fraud and ensure the accuracy of disclosure to investors.” In its proposed rules, the SEC said that the fees underwriting banks receive when a SPAC closes a deal could indicate participation in the merger, and that banks also have a “strong financial interest” in making sure a SPAC inks a deal. For these reasons, the regulator said, it is proposing increasing banks’ liability. To date, investors have not sought to hold major Wall Street banks responsible for false or misleading information alleged in any of the 47 SPAC-related class action shareholder lawsuits filed since 2021, according to a Reuters analysis of a public database maintained by Stanford Law School and attorney Kevin LaCroix, who follows the cases. None of those cases have yet succeeded in court. One aspect of SPACs that has already drawn regulatory scrutiny is undisclosed dealings between blank-check companies and their targets before a merger is announced. That’s because investors could be misled if a SPAC privately shakes hands with an acquisition target while publicly stating it is still seeking the best possible merger partner. Communications between a SPAC and its acquisition target are part of an SEC investigation of former U.S. President Donald Trump's $1.25 billion deal, announced last October, to list his new social media venture on the stock market. In a December filing, Digital World Acquisition Corp, the SPAC that is merging with the former president’s Trump Media & Technology Group, disclosed that the SEC had asked for documents relating to communications between Digital World and Trump Media and meetings of Digital World's board, among other things. The SEC stated in its request that its investigation did not mean the agency had concluded that anyone violated the law, Digital World said. Trump Media has since launched the Truth Social platform to lackluster effect. Trump Media and Digital World Acquisition Corp did not respond to requests for comment. The SEC declined to comment. In the Acies-Playstudios deal, pre-existing relationships raise the question of whether the two companies already had a merger in mind, potentially precluding better deals for investors. Acies told investors when it launched its IPO that it had not identified a company to merge with and that it would pursue the best opportunity it could find. However, Andrew Pascal, chief executive officer of Playstudios, co-founded Acies with Jim Murren, who was chief executive officer of MGM Resorts Inc when that casino operator invested in Playstudios, as was disclosed in a securities filing. Playstudios said it “considered all viable SPAC proposals and eventually made the decision it believed was the best of the available options for the company.” Responding to Reuters inquiries on behalf of Murren and Pascal, Playstudios noted that MGM Resorts, not Murren personally, invested in the company, and that Pascal recused himself from ""all Acies deliberations concerning Playstudios"" once talks began and ""forfeited his economic interest in Acies to avoid even the appearance of having conflicting interests."" BACKWATER TO BONANZA For decades, SPACs were a backwater of Wall Street, connecting speculators with companies that had no other means of going public. That changed in late 2019 and early 2020, when shares of Richard Branson’s spaceflight provider Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc and sports betting operator DraftKings Inc surged more than 600% after going public through SPAC mergers. Investors stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and flush with cash from government stimulus payments helped drive those gains, and they clamored for more. Wall Street banks were happy to oblige and began aggressively promoting the business. In client presentations and other documents reviewed by Reuters, they repeatedly acknowledged the tainted reputation of SPACs and boasted of their ability to bring quality companies to market through blank-check deals. In a 2020 presentation, Morgan Stanley said there was a “historical perception of lower quality companies picking (the) SPAC route, although views have improved somewhat.” For its part, Morgan Stanley said it associated “only with the highest quality partners.” Some of its past partners include Acies, the SPAC that brought Playstudios to market. Shares of the 51 companies that Morgan Stanley has helped take public through SPACs either as an adviser or by raising money to close the deal since the beginning of 2020 were down 28% on average through late March, according to a Reuters analysis. Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the presentation and the performance of shares in companies that went public through its SPACs. Citigroup, in a 2019 presentation, said that while SPACs historically had been considered a “four-letter” word, synonymous with poor outcomes, that perception was changing as investors’ appetite for new alternatives grew. Companies that Citi helped bring to market through SPACs since 2020, either as an adviser or by raising money to close the deal, were down 38% on average at the beginning of May, according to a Reuters analysis of SPAC Research data. Among its many deals, Citi was an underwriter for the IPO of a SPAC called Spartan Acquisition Corp II and an adviser to the company Spartan subsequently acquired, Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc, a financier of solar energy systems. The bank helped Spartan determine its valuation of Sunlight at $1.3 billion, based on Sunlight’s own profit estimates, securities filings show. Sunlight later slashed its profit estimates. The shares, after peaking at about $14.33 in early 2021, are now trading at less than $5. Citi and Sunlight declined to comment. Credit Suisse, in a fourth-quarter 2020 presentation to corporate clients, pointed out that the latitude companies enjoy when issuing business forecasts in SPAC deals can “help improve investor perception of the company.” That would be particularly helpful, it said, for companies that “may have struggled to go public via a traditional IPO.” In the same presentation, Credit Suisse highlighted the “creative marketing tactics” it used in the Virgin Galactic deal. These included flying investors and analysts to tour Virgin Galactic’s factory and Spaceport America complex, which the bank said added “a ‘wow’ factor that a regular-way IPO process could not have provided.” When Virgin Galactic went public, it wasn’t generating any revenue. Its shares soared in the months after the listing, peaking at $62.80. They subsequently tumbled amid delays in some product testing and are now trading below $10. In a 2021 presentation, Credit Suisse asserted that the surge in blank-check deals was being driven by “high quality sponsors” that “seek to partner with blue-chip assets.” Quality aside, share prices of the 56 companies Credit Suisse helped bring to market through SPACs in the past two years were down on average about 32% at the end of March, according to a Reuters analysis of data from SPAC Research. A Credit Suisse spokesperson said the bank is “very selective when it comes to choosing SPAC clients,” and that it treats SPAC mergers “much the same way as regular IPOs” in terms of the bank’s internal approval process. When working for a company that could merge with a SPAC, the bank evaluates alternatives and helps identify the “most suitable course of action,” regardless of whether Credit Suisse underwrote the blank-check firm’s IPO, the spokesperson said. Virgin Galactic declined to comment. Another company Credit Suisse helped bring to market is Paysafe Ltd. The online payments platform was valued at $9 billion in a March 2021 merger with a SPAC. Credit Suisse had underwritten the SPAC’s IPO and acted as an adviser to Paysafe on the subsequent merger. The $9 billion valuation was based in part on Paysafe’s forecast that its digital wallets business would see double-digit growth from 2020 to 2023. Securities filings show that banks were involved in discussions on establishing the valuation. After Paysafe went public, it had to write down its digital wallets business and make technological improvements to it. The shares are down more than 80% from their January 2021 peak. Paysafe decided to go public through a SPAC because it was the “best route to take to public markets,” and hired Credit Suisse because it had worked with the bank on prior deals, according to a company spokesperson. Paysafe has put in place a turnaround plan for its digital wallets business that is “well underway” to “deliver on a new growth trajectory,” the spokesperson said. A representative for Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II, the SPAC that acquired Paysafe, declined to comment. WAITING IN THE WINGS The deal that took car retailer CarLotz Inc public underscores the aggressive tactics banks adopted in their pursuit of SPACs. The Richmond, Virginia-based company, which sells used cars on consignment online and through retail outlets, began looking for a buyer through a conventional sale in late 2019 but failed to find one at the $1 billion price it wanted, a source familiar with the matter said. Several months later, Deutsche Bank pitched itself as a sell-side adviser to CarLotz, pledging to find a SPAC buyer, according to a person familiar with the situation. The bank sought SPAC buyers that would value CarLotz at a minimum of $750 million, based on the $730 million paid for rival Shift Technologies Inc in a recent SPAC merger, and possibly as much as $2 billion, a source familiar with the matter said. And Deutsche Bank already had a bidder waiting in the wings, a SPAC called Acamar Partners Acquisition Corp. Deutsche Bank had advised Acamar as an underwriter on its launch more than a year earlier, and the blank-check company was running out of time to secure a merger. Less than a month after CarLotz hired Deutsche Bank, the bank suggested to Acamar that it make an offer for CarLotz, according to regulatory filings. Acamar made a winning offer of $827 million, less than CarLotz had hoped for, but beating out two other bidders, the filings show. In anticipation of its stock market listing, CarLotz started wooing investors with glowing forecasts. It projected it would have almost $1 billion in sales in 2022, nearly nine times its estimated 2020 revenue. It could meet demand, it said, from a diverse supplier base of used cars from corporate fleets. About seven months later, a supplier representing more than 60% of CarLotz’s cars sold in the prior quarter paused its relationship with the company. Sales dried up. Revenue for 2021 came to only $259 million. CarLotz shares are down more than 90% since they were listed, giving the company a market value of less than $100 million. Deutsche Bank did far better. It received fees of approximately $6.7 million as an underwriter and $14.1 million as an adviser, according to Refinitiv estimates. CarLotz and Acamar did not respond to requests for comment. In an interview, Eric Hackel, head of equity origination solutions at Deutsche Bank, declined to comment on the CarLotz deal specifically. In general, he said, the bank’s due diligence for a traditional IPO is “a little bit more thorough” than for a SPAC, but it does “a tremendous amount of diligence on companies we underwrite.” On deals for which the bank is advising the private company and has also underwritten the SPAC acquiring it, “there’s usually another bank advising,” Hackel said. Ultimately, he said, “it’s up to the company” if they hire the same bank that underwrote the SPAC to advise them on a deal. He noted that retail investors enjoy some of the protections institutional investors have – such as the right to redeem shares for $10 before a deal closes. However, once a deal is done, Hackel said, retail investors “have to make their own decisions. They have to do their own diligence.” Kyle Brown, a 30-year-old accountant in Groton, Connecticut, invested in CarLotz. “We lost the totality of our investment with the exception of $35,” he said. “It was about $11,000, $12,000.” Brown had hoped his investment would help pay for a new house, but he ended up having to find other ways to fund a down payment.

How Covid propelled trillion-dollar valuations,https://www.zawya.com/en/opinion/business-insights/how-covid-propelled-trillion-dollar-valuations-k1ofrumy,2022-07-21,2022-07-21,"“A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you’re talking real money,” the late US Senator Everett Dirksen once said, mainly with reference to out-of-control federal spending in America. It was a snarky understatement to emphasise not just wasteful government spending, but also the value of a billion dollars, which, expressed numerically, is 1 followed by nine zeroes — as in, US $1,000,000,000. Although the world’s first billion-dollar company (US Steel) announced itself in 1901, and the world’s first billionaire (John Rockefeller of Standard Oil) was minted in 1916, even in the 1950s, when Dirksen was said to have made the comment, a billion was big, big bucks. Today, a billion dollars — or even a million dollars for that matter — is still a lot of money for an individual. There are approximately 2,800 known billionaires — and many unknown — in the world, a list currently led by Tesla’s Elon Musk, with an estimated wealth of $280bln. But in corporate terms, it is becoming chump change. Companies founded on a whim and prayer, or an app and hope, acquire valuation of a billion dollars in quick time, often based on speculative hope and hype. In an era of easy come-easy go, some endure, many do not. Dubbed Unicorns, a term first popularised by venture capitalist Aileen Lee after the mythical animal to represent the statistical rarity of such successful ventures, they have become a fairly common measure of entrepreneurial fizz. In 2013, when the term was first used to describe startups that scaled up quickly to a billion dollars, there were less than 40 unicorns, mainly in the US. Today, there are an estimated 1,000 unicorns across the world, including 300 in China and 100 in India. Some 30 unicorns, including already-famous names such as SpaceX, Instacart, Stripe, and ByteDance, each valued between $10bln and $100bln, have been given the name Decacorn. Scaling further up, Decacorns become Hectocorns when they are valued at over $100bln. Up until this stage, Unicorns, Decacorns, and Hectocorns are startup companies that are private, venture-backed entities, recognised and evaluated for their potential for growth, and not on their financial performance. Riding on “get big fast” (GBF) strategies, also known as Blitzscaling, these startups try to expand at a high rate through large funding rounds and price cutting to gain an advantage on market share and overrun competitors as quickly as possible. In pursuit of this foothold or market share, many of them don’t make a dime in profit; instead, they burn money to get ahead. Facebook was the first Decacorn and Hectocorn in history, crossing a $100bln valuation before it went public (once they go public with an IPO, they no longer qualify for the informal -corn suffix). It was followed by China’s Alibaba. ByteDance, owners of the app TikTok, which is backed by investors such as Sequoia Capital China and Softbank Group among others, is a current Decacorn, valued at over $140bln — more than the current market cap of storied companies such as AT&T and American Express. Since Facebook became the first privately-held Decacorn-turned-Hectocorn, a $100bln-plus privately-held company, an additional 84 Decacorns have been created. Not all have survived, with 33 of them losing their status for various reasons. This leaves 51 companies still straining at the leash to go public, whereupon they enter new terrain. They include names such as India’s Byju’s, currently valued at $21bln, making it the world’s most valuable education technology startup, and China’s Yuanfudao, also an edtech startup valued at $15.5bln. While Unicorns and Decacorns grow through large funding rounds from private venture capital firms and investors to get an early foothold in the marketplace, sitting on top of the pyramid are companies that do go public and scale a stratospheric height of a trillion dollars — companies for which there is still no agreed upon term as yet. The name Pegasus has been suggested for such companies which reach the new valuation pinnacle of $1trln (like the unicorn, the pegasus is also a mythical horse, but with wind beneath its wings). Collectively, they are simply known as Big Tech. They are the T company. The market cap of $1trln A trillion is no trifling sum. For starters, it is 1 followed by 12 zeroes — as in $1,000,000,000,000. A trillion dollars is greater than the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of all but a score of countries. It is greater than the GDP of Switzerland, Sweden and Argentina, each with GDP below one trillion dollars in nominal terms. For that matter, the valuation of Apple, which recently crossed $3trln (it has since dropped to about $2.65trln at the time of writing), nudged the GDP of Great Britain and India, two of the larger economies of the world. Today, there are around half-a-dozen companies in the world that have a market cap of over $1trln. All but Saudi Aramco are US-born and US-based, and each has a tech orientation. As of March 31, 2022, they are led by Apple ($2.85trln), followed by Microsoft ($2.31trln), Alphabet/ Google ($1.84trln), Amazon ($1.65trln), and, the most recent addition to the list, Tesla ($1.1trln). Couple others have crossed the 1-T mark or nibbled at it and receded — notably PetroChina and Meta/Facebook. The rise, rise, and rise of US tech companies has also led to growing concerns about ‘Big Tech’ — an analogous recall of market dominance by a few companies in other market sectors such as Big Oil and Big Pharma. For instance, the big five tech stocks, originally dubbed FAAMG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google) and now TAAMG (with Tesla replacing Facebook, which has lost nearly 30 per cent of its valuation), account for about a quarter of the market capitalisation of the entire 500 companies in Standard&Poor’s 500. This effectively means 1% of the companies in the index account for about 25% of the total market value. Such market concentration isn’t unusual. In fact, some companies in the past represented an even bigger share of the market. Back in 1932, AT&T accounted for 13% of total US stock market value, more than twice Apple’s approximately 6% share of the current S&P value (about $ 40 trillion). Even further back, in 1928, General Motors represented 8% of the market, and, in 1970, IBM 7%. But there is a big difference in the time and pace of how the modern Big Tech became bellwethers. While four of the five American companies hit the $1trln market cap before the pandemic, what is remarkable is that the onset of Covid-19 — which lowered the boom on many traditional legacy companies — powered Big Tech to even greater heights. For instance, Apple, which hit $1trln market cap on August 2, 2018, doubled that in just two years, going up to $2trln on August 19, 2020, in the middle of the pandemic. It took even less time to breach $3trln (on January 3, 2022) before receding slightly. Similarly, Microsoft went from breaching $1 trillion in June 2019 to surpassing $2trln in June 2021, and Google went from scaling 1-T in January 2020 to topping 2-T in November 2021. So, what gives? How and why did this happen, particularly during a pandemic? The pandemic and the online giants To begin with, even in the pre-pandemic economy, four members of the Trillion Dollar Club (Tesla came late to the party) dominated their respective market: Apple in smartphones, Microsoft in cloud computing, Alphabet/Google in Internet advertising, and Amazon in online retail. When the pandemic kicked in, the stay- work- and buy-from-home economy brought rich rewards to these companies. While the already besieged brick-and-mortar companies collapsed, the online giants boomed, helped in addition by stimulus payments that put money in people’s pockets on top of low interest rates. Apple and Microsoft sales of IT products and cloud services soared, as did Amazon retailing and Google services, as people spent more and more time indoors and online. In many ways, the pandemic helped clarify a trend that was already becoming apparent before Covid-19 struck. Rewind or flashback 25 years, and you will see that the top 10 companies in terms of market cap were a mix of oil, food, pharma, and technology, all valued between $100 million and $220 million. In 1997, the list of most valued companies in the world read General Electric, Royal Dutch, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Coca Cola, Intel, Nippon, Merck Toyota, and Novartis. Up until even a decade ago, five of the top ten publicly listed companies in terms of market cap were oil companies, with Exxon Mobil and PetroChina leading the way. There were only two tech companies in the list — Apple at #3 and Microsoft at #10. In fact, PetroChina, a Chinese oil and gas company, an arm of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, became the first company to roar past the $1 trillion mark in 2007, a decade before Apple rang up its first trillion in market cap. In January 2007, just as PetroChina was nearing the $1 trillion valuation, Apple introduced its first iPhone, when the company was still shy of being $100 billion (it was worth $73.4 billion at that point). Introducing the iPhone, Apple founder Steve Jobs promised a “leapfrog product” that would be “way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, super easy to use”. As it turned out, not only did Apple reinvent the phone, it reinvented the market. In the years to come, the iPhone would become one of history’s best-selling products, racking up (most recently) sales of more $200 billion annually within a decade. The device has now become so ubiquitous that television presenter Jason Silva, paraphrasing the philosopher Descartes, joked “iPhone, therefore I am”. Signs that the iPhone would power Apple to the top spot became clear as early as 2012, when it displaced ExxonMobil as the world’s most valuable company, with PetroChina slipping to third place. The new-age ‘pinnacle’ In the decade since, Apple has never lost that pole position — except in 2019, when Microsoft briefly toppled it. Founded in 1974, just a few months before Apple by Jobs’ contemporary Bill Gates, Microsoft is another money-spinning behemoth, often ranked with Apple as one of the most profitable companies in the world. Just as Apple reinvented the phone, and itself, with the iPhone, Microsoft relaunched itself with cloud computing, the biggest revenue source for a company that was a byword for software. Relative to Apple and Microsoft, which are of mid-1970s vintage, Amazon and Facebook were founded in the 1990s; Tesla is even newer, founded only in 2003. But each has carved a niche in the market in its area, with rivals at a distant second. By early this year, Big Tech had completely trumped traditional companies, with eight of the ten most valued companies in the world all belonging to the tech stable: Apple, Microsoft, Google /Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla occupying top five positions, with Nvidia, Meta/Facebook, and TSMC in the 5-10 slot. The only exceptions were Berkshire Hathaway at #6 and United Health at #10. So, are the T-companies really worth all that much, how much further can they — and will they — grow? What propelled them to such dizzy heights and will they survive? These are questions that haunt every market maven as the world teeters on the brink of the twin crisis of war and pestilence. The recent tumult over the hostile bid for Twitter, and the meltdown of Netflix stock, has raised new questions on valuation. But one thing looks certain, at least in our lifetime: the trillion-dollar pinnacle is the new summit large companies will aspire to climb. Copyright © 2022 Khaleej Times. All Rights Reserved.

Iridium study finds that less than 1/3 of IPOs in the GCC succeed,https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/research-and-studies/iridium-study-finds-that-less-than-1-3-of-ipos-in-the-gcc-succeed-rdfzoenf,2022-07-21,2022-07-21,"Dubai: With 38 GCC market debuts, 2021 was the best year for new listings since 2007. Yet, the high volume of listings disguises the reality that only one-third are successful. Specifically, just 38% of IPOs were priced adequately - the majority of companies leave too much money on the table. Only 32% of companies traded within the typically desired share price range of 20% within the first 30 days of going public. And merely 31% of new listings outperform companies that are already listed in the longer term. These are among the findings of a new report published by Iridium Advisors, entitled “The Renaissance of IPOs in the GCC,” that examines the success rate of company listing and demystifies some common misconceptions about IPO winners and losers. Iridium’s analysis of 457 initial public offerings in the GCC region between 2005 and 2021, benchmarked companies against three objective criteria of success: 1. Underpricing: the difference between the IPO offer price and the first-day closing price 2. Stabilization period: the 30-day period of price stabilization post-listing 3. Excess return: the relative company share price versus a country index over time “It is very encouraging to see government-owned and private companies embracing public equity markets in the GCC,” says Oliver Schutzmann, CEO of Iridium Advisors and a co-author of the report. “With a well-thought-out program of new public listings, which is already underway, the region has the opportunity to re-energize its capital markets and attract foreign capital to diversify economic growth. Nevertheless, there is still a big mountain to climb to unlock the true capital markets potential of listed companies for both issuers and investors.” Companies planning a public listing need to be aware of the high probability of disappointment and ask why this should be the case. Iridium’s analysis has identified three key areas that are commonly overlooked by company owners, directors and senior management that can play a part in improving the odds of success: 1. There are different dynamics at play in the primary and secondary market: Successful issuers recognize that investors trade among themselves in the secondary market without any direct involvement from the company, and that their company is only worth as much as the last share price. 2.  There is a difference between pre-IPO and post-IPO investors: Companies whose share price outperforms its benchmark after the listing understand that there are different types of investors with varying motivations and interests. 3. The assumption that Public Relations and Investor Relations are synonymous could lead to failure: While both PR and IR have an important role to play, PR features more prominently before and after an IPO, while IR often tends to remain an afterthought. Schutzmann concludes by adding: “The risk of value destruction is real for private and public sector companies in the GCC preparing for an IPO, SPAC, or a direct listing in 2022. It is, however, not inevitable. Key areas of focus to improve the chances of success are taking a long-term view in pre-IPO preparation, identifying the right type of investor, and developing the capability to create organic relationships with the professional investment community. These three steps can guard against major share price gyrations after a listing and will go a long way to ensure that the region’s companies – and their owners - are rewarded with the right valuation by the market.” A copy of the report can be downloaded here.

Kuwait's government is taking cautious measures to keep critical commodity prices in check and has halted all grain exports for the next three months. Central Bank of Kuwait has raised its main interest rates by 25 bps in March, subsequent to the interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve and Kuwaiti banks are expected to be benefitted by this interest rate hike. Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain have also increased their policy rates by 25 bps. Kuwait’s M2 money supply expanded 1.9% YoY in January, and bank lending to the private sector grew by 6.8% YoY in the same month. Kuwaiti bank revenues grew 7.1% in 2021 with profits almost doubling to $2.9 billion driven by increase in revenues as well as decline in loan loss provisions.

            ",2022-07-21,"Brazilian fintech Nubank launched in 2013, headed by billionaire David Velez with assets valued at $ 5 billion. The company offers loans, account loans and insurance. It quickly conquered the Brazilian market by offering its services free of charge - unlike local traditional financial institutions, and then it entered other Latin American countries. Suffice it to say that several hundred thousand Colombians have already signed up to use its services, waiting for the official start of Nubank in their country. In eight years, fintech gained 40 million customers in the Americas, and Warren Buffet alone invested in the company over $ 500 million. For now, this company is valued at $ 30 billion. However, after going public, its value could rise to as much as $ 50 billion, making it the most valuable online bank in the world. By comparison, Nubank's biggest competitor, Swedish Klarna, is valued at $ 45.6 billion. According to experts, such a high valuation is just the beginning - the Latin American market still has untapped potential, and Nubank is getting ready for global expansion - now it plans to enter the Indian market and has invested at least $ 45 million in fintech Jupiter. Poles can also participate in the stock exchange debut in NYC via the website freedom24.com, i.e. through the online store of the Freedom Finance Europe holding, which is a subsidiary of the American holding company, whose activities are regulated by the strict American Securities Commission - so do not worry about the certainty and security of transactions . The company is valued at $ 4 billion on the market and employs 2,000 people in 10 countries. Its services have already been used by over 340 thousand. Customers. INVEST IN NUBANK The investment itself is simple - you need to create an account in the Freedom24 store and then enter the amount you want to spend on investments (minimum $ 2,000, for shares costing from 10 to 11 dollars) - subscriptions last until December 8. The store warns, however, that we may receive shares for less than the amount for which the order was placed. Freedom24 reminds you that due to the number of investors, it can only execute part of the brokerage order. This is perfectly normal and happens every time you go public. The allocation rate, depending on the IPO, is from 1%. Up to 70 percent Of course, the money for the shares that have not been purchased is returned to the clients' accounts. The store reminds that the allocation depends on the customer's assessment. It is influenced by the number of transactions, the liquidity of the securities portfolio, as well as whether buyers invested sums of a similar size in other IPOs. This means that if someone is just beginning to be interested in the action cinema during stock market debuts, he can count on a smaller allocation than an experienced player with a long experience. The IPO is the ""Initial Public Offering"", ie the stock exchange debut during which the company's shares go mainly to institutional investors and - to a lesser extent - to individual players. During this process, the company ceases to be privately owned and becomes a public offering. An IPO is mainly used to raise new capital or profits from private shareholders who had invested in the company before it went public. After its debut, the shares of a given company are available on the open market on the selected trading floor. Although the process has many advantages, its preparation, which is usually the responsibility of investment banks (they must - for example - estimate the cost of shares in a public offering), is expensive - entering the trading floor requires meeting many requirements and paying additional costs. Details of the offer can be found in the prospectus, which is also prepared by the investment bank."

There are so many things that can still be improved in the area of ​​our business and we are back to work on them - he said. Nuyts also said that he will not spread great visions of development now, he will limit himself to thanking him. As he emphasized, thanks are due, above all, 100 thousand. sellers operating on the platform and 12 million customers. He also thanked the company's employees and all external companies involved in the IPO. The total value of Allegro's public offering will be PLN 10.6 billion if the additional allocation option is fully exercised or PLN 9.2 billion without the additional allocation option. The public offering included the issue of 23,255,814 new shares, from which the company obtained gross proceeds of approximately PLN 1 billion, and the sale of 190,293,225 existing shares sold by the existing shareholders. The funds from the issue of new shares are to be used to repay the company's debt. Allegro's offer initially included a total of 216 million shares (including up to 15% of shares that will go to Morgan Stanley as an option stabilizing the price after the company's debut on the stock exchange). After the offer was raised, the total number of shares offered was 246,857,143, including the stabilization option. Free float shares will account for 20.9 percent. (before exercising the additional allocation option). The remaining shares held by majority shareholders are covered by a lock-up agreement for 180 days from the first day of listing on the WSE. Under the Allegro offer, retail investors were allotted a total of 9,342,771 shares, and institutional investors a total of 236,238,624 shares (including additional allotment shares). The average reduction rate for buy orders placed by retail investors in the Allegro offer was approximately 84.85%. Allegro Group runs the largest trading platform in Poland, which is Allegro. pl, and the price comparison engine in Poland - Ceneo.pl and employs over 2,400 people. Allegro's profit in the first half of this year. increased year on year to PLN 289.7 million from PLN 195.7 million. Krzysztof Krawczyk, CEO Shoper Allegro's debut on the WSE will be more important for the financial market than for the e-commerce industry itself. Here, the relations between stores and marketplaces are already quite well organized, and investments in the sector should have a positive impact on the entire e-commerce industry in Poland. Allegro is also one of the sales channels for online stores. Allegro is a business partner for companies such as ours, which provide solutions for online sales. We encourage online stores using our platform to sell wherever there are customers, including Allegro. Our software has been prepared in such a way as to enable the management of multiple sales channels, both in one's own store and an account on the auction site. At the beginning of 2020, we additionally strengthened our relationship with Allegro, thanks to which online store owners can now use Allegro Ads advertising campaigns. We also noticed that Allegro sellers started to launch their own channel more often and integrate it with sales service in the marketplace to have everything in one place. Thanks to these movements, the number of stores with Allegro integration has increased by 39 percent since the beginning of the year. Paweł Szewczyk, Vice President of the Management Board of merce.com Allegro's debut is a local confirmation of what is happening on global stock exchanges. Companies related to e-commerce are starting to actively seek funds for further dynamic development. In August, the BigCommerce platform made its debut on the stock exchange overseas, and a few weeks ago, Wish marketplace announced similar plans. Investors look favorably at smaller (compared to Allegro and American giants) e-commerce companies, because they are able to ensure high rates of return. Although the property of Jeff Bezos attracts the attention of the media the most, it is not Amazon that boasts the greatest increases on the global stock exchanges, but local e-commerce companies that are smaller than it. An example of such a company can be the Swedish Boozt, German Home24 or the Polish SFD. All this should encourage more Polish players to enter the dance floor. Answear has already announced this. Against this background, Allegro's entry on the WSE is not so much a harbinger of a new era for online trading, but fits in with the current trend of investing in e-commerce businesses, which the Covid-19 pandemic is further exacerbated. A psychological factor may turn out to be significant, if, as expected, the Poznań website turns out to be the highest-valued company on the stock exchange and maintains this position for longer, dethroning the current leader, CD Projekt. He may then follow in his footsteps as a popularizer of his industry in the collective imagination. It was similar with gaming, which, thanks to the stock exchange successes of the Warsaw studio, began to be perceived not only from the perspective of new technologies, but also in the business and investment context. Ewa Bartnik, Finance and HR Director of IMKER We are concerned that the date of Allegro's listing on the stock exchange is not without significance. The e-commerce giant Amazon is likely to start operating on the Polish market soon, and its presence will negatively affect the valuation of the Polish company. Today Allegro shares seem bargain, but it may very quickly turn out that entering the stock exchange was profitable only from the perspective of current investors."

            ",2022-07-21,"According to Le Nouvel Observateur, ""numerous complaints"" have been filed against Facebook and the three banks - Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs - which were underwriters during the IPO of an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Banks are accused of informing only the largest investors about this, having lowered the prospects for Facebook. Those who were not warned filed collective complaints on Wednesday, saying they had been wronged by FB's failed debut. Facebook made its debut on Friday in New York on the Nasdaq over-the-counter new technology market. The IPO was less spectacular than expected and the FB share fell further until Wednesday as they recovered 2.77%. As Le Nouvel Observateur writes, FB kept its listing on the day of its debut slightly above the opening price only thanks to the intervention of the banks that introduced it to the stock exchange. According to Reuters, on May 9, even before its debut, the portal instructed analysts of banks guaranteeing the issue to lower their earnings forecasts. In the following days, Morgan Stanley and at least three out of 33 institutions introducing FB to the stock exchange lowered their forecasts for the second quarter of this year and their annual forecasts and provided information about it to selected institutional investors. Reuters - citing anonymous sources - reports that FB provided the right guidance to underwriters, which may mean that banks are responsible for misleading most investors. Two American institutions, federal and state, regulating the stock market, will investigate the portal's IPO - writes Reuters, without specifying which market regulators are meant. Facebook declined to comment on the investigation, and Morgan Stanley issued a statement saying that it followed the same procedures with the portal that it adopts for the IPOs of other companies. The IPO of the social networking site coincided with a very difficult moment on the stock exchanges. Concerns that the European sovereign debt crisis will plunge many banks in the EU have caused significant declines in global stock markets, and the FB debut has failed to improve sentiment on Wall Street. Some analysts advised against investing in Facebook shares before the IPO, explaining that the company's highest valuation (USD 104 billion) puts FB ahead of companies such as Disney and Kraft Food, which earn three or four times more than the portal. 104 billion dollars that's over 100 times more than Facebook earned last year."

Genome editing’s patent problem fuels concern for the future of food,https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/genome-editing-s-patent-problem-fuels-concern-for-the-future-of-food/47287668?utm_campaign=teaser-in-channel&utm_source=swissinfoch&utm_content=o&utm_medium=display,2022-01-31T09:00:00+01:00,2022-07-21,"Amid growing concern about whether a world battered by climate change will be able to produce enough food to feed the planet, genome editing has been touted as part of the solution in many countries including Switzerland. But an outdated patent system threatens to stifle its potential and put more power in the hands of big business. Jessica covers the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to big global companies and their impact in Switzerland and abroad. She’s always looking for a Swiss connection with her native San Francisco and will happily discuss why her hometown has produced some of the greatest innovations but can’t seem to solve its housing crisis.  My specialty is telling stories, and decoding what happens in Switzerland and the world from accumulated data and statistics. An expatriate in Switzerland for several years, I have also worked as a multimedia journalist for the Swiss national broadcaster.  For more than 10 years scientists at Switzerland-based Syngenta Group worked to develop a variety of disease-resistant cabbage that would thrive in hot, dry weather, and benefit the soil by requiring less nitrogen to grow. The basketball-sized vegetable was bred to grow close to the surface, making it easier for farmers to harvest. On display at the company’s annual showcase for its latest seed innovations last autumn, the “weather-proof” cabbage was joined by other new designer vegetables including “rust-resistant” green beans, snackable snow peas, and a “burger leaf” lettuce bred specially to stay crisp and fresh when squashed between a hot burger and a sandwich bun. But agriculture technology firms like Syngenta, now owned by Chinese state-owned company ChemChina, no longer see the need to spend years developing new vegetable varieties using conventional breeding methods that involve crossing two plants over multiple generations. They want to use technology like CRISPR-Cas9, a genome-editing tool that enables them to alter the DNA of vegetables and other crops, adding beneficial traits and removing undesirable ones, to get just the product they want. This could cut the time it takes to produce some new varieties by as much as 75%. More

What’s behind the science and the debate on genome-edited plants?  “Genome editing has a huge amount of potential for the future in terms of the seed products we can develop,” Charlie Baxter, Syngenta’s head of global seed traits and regulatory, told SWI swissinfo.ch. “We need to recognise that if we are going to feed a growing planet, and in a sustainable way, we are going to need to use new technologies.”   With an initial public offering (IPO) on the Shanghai stock exchange in preparation, the company is tight-lipped about its plans. However, a spokesperson told SWI it is investing in genome editing in countries including the US and China to change the nutritional content, increase yields, and improve resistance to pests and diseases across a variety of crops. With each new trait, Syngenta, and many other big seed companies, are amassing more patents, giving them the right to exclude anyone else from reproducing, using, selling, or distributing their invention. But this development is raising red flags among many plant breeding experts and farmers’ rights activists, who fear it will wreck the global seed market, shutting out small players and choking innovation. The introduction of tools like CRISPR-Cas9 into the food system is already a flashpoint in much of Europe as regulators consider how, if at all, it should be regulated. At the centre of the debate are the safety and environmental risks, and whether plants bred with genome-editing technologies should be classified as Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), whose cultivation has been banned or heavily restricted in agriculture in the European Union and SwitzerlandExternal link for nearly two decades. Up to now, Switzerland has followed EU regulators, classifying genome-edited seeds under GMO regulation. But views are shifting – a European Commission studyExternal link published in April 2021 proposed updating legislation to reflect advances in genomic techniques, and in December, one chamberExternal link of the Swiss parliament voted to exclude genome editing from the GMO ban. If the technology advances and more governments allow genome editing, 50% of new seed varieties on the global market will have at least one genome-edited trait in 20 years’ time, predicts Michael Kock, a patent attorney who spent nearly a decade as head of intellectual property at Syngenta. All seeds with these traits will be covered by at least one patent. Genome editing has already led to an exponential rise in the number of patents even though only two genome-edited food products – a soybean oil and a tomato – have been launched on the market. Kock estimates about half of all international plant patent filings in 2021 involved aspects of genome editing.   More Join the discussion Multinational companies Genome editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 are being tabled as a way to feed the planet. What do you think about the idea? According to IPStudies-Centredoc, a Switzerland-based patent analysis firm, there were 21 patent families (all patent filings in different countries for one invention) on plants using CRISPR in 2012. By 2021, this had reached 2,000. Within each patent family, there can be dozens of patents in various countries. While a majority are in China and the US, about 700 extend to other countries. This sea change has profound implications for the future of our food because it means that any new trait like drought resistance or leaf size can be patented provided the genetic change doesn’t already exist in nature. As genome editing allows for more precise changes to a plant’s genome, the number of new traits will surge. And it’s not only traits that can be patented. New breeding methods, genetic sequences and in some cases, products such as beer made with genome-edited barley, can be covered by patents. New plant varieties can also be covered by other forms of intellectual property protection (see box). Such protection should encourage research into new, more useful seeds by giving inventors ways to recoup their investment. Since the advent of GMOs and biotechnology in agriculture, patents are granted more oftenExternal link. Patent laws vary from country to country, but most allow some form of patent or plant variety protection. A seed or plant, as well as any natural object, plant and animal and biological process, is excluded from patent protection. However, a patent can be granted for traits, sequences, or methods if the genetic change doesn’t already exist in nature. Patents are awarded when the applicant can demonstrate it is novel, an inventive step, and has industrial application. A plant varietyExternal link, which is a precisely defined group of plants within the same species, can’t be patented but can be covered by a plant variety protection (PVP) certificate based on conventions from the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV). A certificate is granted when a variety is distinct, uniform, stable and new. There is an exemption for breeders to use the seed (without the consent of the PVP holder) to develop a new variety. Farmers can reuse seeds in some cases but can’t sell or exchange them without consent. It isn’t just the number of patents that is expected to increase. Plant breeding is a constant process of taking one seed and crossing it with another, so that the same germplasm gets passed on to the next generation of seeds. As genome editing speeds up innovation, patents will get stacked on top of each other and overlap more often. In an articleExternal link published late last year, Kock, who now works as an independent advisor to the seed industry, warned that this patent stacking could have a “chilling effect” on innovation. “If one seed is covered by 8-10 patents, it will be so difficult for breeders or farmers to negotiate royalties with all the different patent owners,” Kock told SWI. Breeders will need to secure multiple licenses to market their new variety, which gets complicated and expensive as breeders usually pay a percentage of sales to the patent owner. Some breeders will be reluctant to reuse seeds at all, even those developed through conventional methods, fearful they could unknowingly infringe on someone’s patent. Kock says some breeders already today don’t want to touch the genetics of certain seed companies. These concerns were echoed by the European Commission’s recent studyExternal link, which warned that patents and licensing associated with new genomic techniques can act as a “barrier to market entry” for small companies and limit access to new technologies and genetic material for further breeding. “We need to find a way to make innovation accessible without throwing away the incentive to create the next generation of innovation,"" says Kock. He argues that there needs to be a fundamental overhaul of the intellectual property system. Plant breeding has been practiced for thousands of years by farmers in search of products with desirable traits such as higher yields, resistance to disease, or improved flavour. Today, gardeners and farmers are still involved, but the industry is dominated by companies – Euroseeds, a Brussels-based industry association for the European seed sector, says it has more than 36 national member associations from EU member states and beyond who represent several thousand seed businesses. At the top of the pile are deep-pocketed multinationals such as Syngenta, US-based Corteva Inc. (formerly the agriculture division of DowDuPont), and Bayer AG which bought rival Monsanto in 2018. They are among the world’s 10 largest seed companies who, through mergers and acquisitionsExternal link, are estimated to controlExternal link at least 70% of the global market. Farmers’ rights campaigners and small breeders are increasingly concerned that the inevitable march toward patenting everything will concentrate the seed market even more in the hands of these big companies. “It's not only the technology itself that is a problem, but it's a problem of the power relations and the industrial agricultural system behind it,” says Simon Degelo from Swissaid, which has been campaigning for the rights of small-scale breeders and farmers in poorer countries. “Farmers should be allowed to [freely] choose the seeds they want and re-use them if they think that's best for them.” CRISPR-Cas9 was supposed to democratise innovation because it is cheaper and easier to manipulate genetics in plants. But all the intellectual property protections will shut others out of the market by making it more expensive and difficult for farmers and breeders to re-use seeds, argues Mariam Mayet, director of the African Centre for Biodiversity in Johannesburg, South Africa. “It’s more of the same but just more dangerous because you're now going into the genome of the plant,” says Mayet. This raises the prospect of more genetic material falling into the hands of private companies. Most of the foundational patents for CRISPR technology are owned by academic institutions and licensed out to companies and others to use. This concern is shared by Monika Messmer, a senior scientist at the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture in Switzerland. “When new cultivars [plants bred for certain traits] are released in Europe, breeders still can profit from the progress of others and the whole community improves due to the breeders' exemption of the plant variety protection. That is something highly threatened by patents because you aren’t allowed to take it to improve your own seeds.” She fears more money will flow into major crops like maize and soybean, and into traits like pesticide resistance where the prospects for profit are greatest. “We shouldn’t just be asking if this technology is safe and release it. We also need to ask what benefit it brings to society,” Messmer told SWI. She thinks companies should be required to share genetic material through gene banks for others to use.   Euroseeds told SWI that it encourages companies to license patented traits but that it’s an “individual business decision” what and how to license something. Syngenta’s Baxter says the company is open to sharing technology with others, and has already created a licensing platform for vegetables, which allows breeding companies and academic institutes to use the technology how they want. “Seed companies are successful because they know what they're doing, and they put a lot of expertise into developing new products,” says Baxter. “If they didn't work, people wouldn't buy our seed products. We are trying to do something good for the growers. The market is open to competition.” Edited by Nerys Avery Correction: please note that this story has been updated to clarify that most of the foundational patents for CRISPR technology are owned by academic institutions and licensed out to others to use.

State-owned ChemChina bought the Basel-based Swiss agriscience group Syngenta for $44 billion in 2017. ChemChina’s application to list on Shanghai’s STAR Market was accepted at the start of July and was widely expected to be the world’s largest flotation this year. The STAR market suspended 57 applications on September 30, citing a lack of updated financial information. Under bourse rules, applicants must provide additional information if financial materials in applications are outdated. ""The application review has been temporarily paused"",  ChemChina is also considering a secondary listing for Syngenta that could take place less than a year after its Shanghai debut, with exchanges in Zurich, London and New York among the options being examined, sources told Reuters. The takeover of Syngenta in 2017 and airline catering business Gategroup by Chinese companies in 2016 sparked a reaction by the Swiss authorities and new rules. In the future the takeover of Swiss companies by foreign state-owned or state-linked funds is to be better regulated.

When not covering fintech, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, banks and trade, swissinfo.ch's business correspondent can be found playing cricket on various grounds in Switzerland - including the frozen lake of St Moritz.   Co-founder and chair Olga Feldmeier told me the company is looking at a range of European exchanges on which to list, including Deutsche Börse and Swedish-based Nasdaq First North Growth Market. We will send you a bi-weekly exploration of financial technology innovations in Switzerland. Biweekly The SBC Privacy Policy provides additional information on how your data is processed.  I consent to the use of my data for the SWI swissinfo.ch newsletter. Nasdaq First North has hosted three crypto initial public offerings (IPOs) already this year: Coinshares, Safello and Xpecunia. All these listings were heavily over-subscribed at a time when the cryptocurrency market had witnessed spectacular price gains. In April, the US crypto exchange Coinbase caused a stir by raising $86 billion by listing on Nasdaq. Smart Valor has a more modest two-digit million target from its proposed IPO. Feldmeier is confident that Smart Valor has boosted its balance sheet enough with its latest funding round to pass muster at most exchanges. But she would not be drawn on the timing of an IPO. “The blockchain technology, as every other early-stage technology, currently still has a bit of mixed reputation,” she said. “As an authorised exchange and custodian we practice stringent corporate governance which helps to gain trust of our customers. As a bridge between the decentralised economy and consumers we are in the business of trust. This goes hand-in-hand with a public listing.” Other companies are also eager to escape the sometimes murky shadows of the cryptocurrency industry. Having failed to gain a Swiss banking license earlier this year, Bitcoin Suisse now says it wants to go public in the near future. Set up in canton Zug’s “Crypto valley” in 2017, Smart Valor is also eyeing up a distributed ledger technology (DLT) stock exchange license in Switzerland. “It’s a state-of-the-art license. No other country has created such an advanced regulatory framework for blockchain based exchanges today,” says Feldmeier. As I said in my last newsletter, it’s been all but impossible to set up a cryptocurrency exchange in Switzerland in the past without a banking license. Smart Valor, Lykke and Swissborg have all found it easier to operate elsewhere in Europe despite having Swiss HQs. Smart Valor runs its asset management business from Switzerland and currently operates exchange services from neighbouring Liechtenstein – where it is also applying for a license to issue digital securities. More widely known exchanges, like Binance and Bitfinex once tried their luck with the Swiss regulator but decided against the move. For a long time, this was a noticeable empty space for a country that markets itself as “Crypto Nation”. The new Swiss DLT exchange license, unveiled on August 1, now provides another option – with the added benefit of being able to trade digital securities to the general public. This might produce some competition for the SIX Digital Exchange, which was awarded a license to operate last month. I will explore the theme of how Switzerland plans to gentrify cryptocurrencies in an article on SWI Swissinfo.ch soon, so watch out for it. More

Swiss footwear company On is making a name for itself in an industry that has been dominated by big players like Nike. What makes it different?  The previous day, Sportradar started a new chapter in its history as a Nasdaq-listed company worth $8 billion. Both firms had good reasons to opt for an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. Sportradar is taking advantage of recently relaxed sports betting laws that pave the way for more US states to legalise the practice. The Swiss-based company says it aims to grab around a third of the rapidly expanding US market with its technology that processes sports data for the media and betting industries. “Ultimately, for any company, the decision of where to go public is a business decision rather than one related to patriotism,” Leti McManus, founder of consultancy firm Tiger Link Advisors, told SWI swissinfo.ch. This also applies to On Group, which leverages its Swiss quality label and the backing of Federer. The Zurich-headquartered company chose to list on the NYSE because the United States last year became the brand’s largest market with the highest growth in sales. “The US is the largest sportswear market in the world. A listing there offers a massive opportunity for publicity and media exposure, which means visibility amongst customers and investors,” said McManus. “The NYSE is home to other well-known sportswear brands, such a Nike and Adidas, so it’s no surprise that On wanted to list on the same platform as the big players.” On Group has seen sales almost triple in the last three years to CHF425.3 million in 2020. But these sums pale in comparison to industry market leaders Nike and Adidas, which dominate the $118.5 billion global sports shoe market. The sportswear industry as a whole suffered from the Covid-19 pandemic, which closed retail stores around the world, but market research firm Euromonitor expects the sports shoe market to pick up to reach around $180 billion by 2024. On appears to be following in the footsteps of Nike, which catapulted into the big league in 1984 by designing a basketball shoe endorsed by legendary player Michael Jordan (who is now, coincidentally, a backer of Sportradar). Federer became an On Group investor in 2019 and has helped design a tennis shoe bearing his name. Back in Switzerland, the main Swiss stock exchange has averaged just under five company listings per year between 2010 and 2020. Operator SIX Group aims to improve on this record by introducing a new share segment, called SparksExternal link, aimed at encouraging some of the country’s nearly 600,000 small and medium sized enterprisesExternal link (with less than 250 employees) to list their stock.

In an interview in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, the co-CEOs asserted that the company cultureExternal link will stay the same – focused on running and nature. Instead of going out to buy Porches and yachts today, the employees at On’s local offices apparently celebrated the IPO by climbing a mountain. For years, the company had a niche following among athletes and urban trendsetters but this changed when tennis star Roger Federer came on board as an investor and designer of his own shoe line. The company also outfitted the Swiss Summer Olympic Team, giving it visibility and catapulting it into the mainstream and as a viable competitor to the likes of Nike and Adidas. But the company has always said it wants to do things differently than the big footwear brands on the market. And a big part of that is using its “Swissness” – quality, innovation and design – to its advantage. Industry watchers are curious what the company will do next with the cash influx. One clue, say the CEOs, is the company plans to take on the Chinese market, opening 40-50 new outlets in the country in the “medium term”.  Deep Dive: What airports tell us about how countries see the future of the pandemic. For many of us that braved Covid restrictions and took an airplane in the past few months, soaring above the clouds never felt so exhilarating. But the starkly different travel experiences at airports in cities like Beijing, Zurich and London are a window into how different cultures deal with pandemic fears and how they view the future. Sam Jones from the Financial Times writes today about his own experience flying back and forth from Zurich to London. Where Zurich is calm and orderly, London is complex and costly as it copes with the UK’s ever-changing travel and border policies. In November, as the second wave of the pandemic gripped Europe, Zurich airport opened its gleaming new business conference centre, writes Jones. If Zurich airport is a “signal of Switzerland’s intent after the pandemic, it is one of openness and business as usual”. Switzerland and Britain are the two big European economies outside the European Union, and if they are serious about trading with the bloc, “it is their airports that count as the litmus test of how that is going”. But making your way through London airport still pales in comparison to the experience in China where authorities have gone to far-reaching extents to maintain its “no Covid” strategyExternal link. A journalist with the NZZ said his experience traveling to Qingdao, China felt sometimes “like you're on a mission to the moon”. The journey included seventeen coronavirus tests, three weeks in quarantine, one dead bat, and too many QR codes to count. What's your experience been like traveling?

UBS wealth business booms but are risks piling up?,https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/ubs-wealth-business-booms-but-are-risks-piling-up-/46942876?utm_campaign=teaser-in-channel&utm_source=swissinfoch&utm_content=o&utm_medium=display,2021-09-13T08:47:00+02:00,2022-07-21,"Soon after Iqbal Khan joined Credit Suisse in 2013 he was invited to dinner at Zurich’s elegant Ristorante Bindella for a discreet conversation with the chief financial officer of UBS, his new employer’s fierce rival. Khan had got to know Tom Naratil well over the previous two years while Khan was a partner at EY and lead auditor to Switzerland’s UBS. Over a chandelier-lit pasta meal, Naratil decided UBS would benefit from bringing the highly ambitious Khan onboard.  Now, two years after the ex-auditor finally joined his one-time client, Khan and Naratil are running UBS’s $3.6-trillion (CHF3.3 trillion) wealth business, the bank’s beating heart and its profits engine. “The fact that they didn’t end up in a situation where either got fired or they killed each other, that’s actually a pretty good relationship,” said a senior UBS executive. But with profits hitting record levels, the pair must now prove they can keep returns high while also managing the growing risks. As the world’s biggest wealth manager, UBS has had a stellar pandemic. Its ultra-wealthy clients have seen their assets soar on the back of the trillions central banks pumped into the global economy. Much of that injection has ended up in the financial markets, helping the total wealth of billionaires worldwide rise from $5 trillion to $13 trillion in the first 12 months of the pandemic. UBS’s Global Wealth Management business reported $1.3 billion of quarterly pre-tax profits in July, accounting for half the wider group’s total profits. That represented a 47% increase on a year earlier and its best second quarter ever, with record profits in Asia. But UBS’s resurgence in wealth management has as much to do with a new strategy code-named Elevate, which was introduced by Naratil and Khan 18 months ago, as it does with macroeconomic events. The plan was to restructure the ailing wealth business to make it more efficient and sell higher-margin products and services to UBS’s richest clients, taking advantage of the bank’s considerable heft. “I don’t think it was rocket science what we did,” said Khan in an interview with the FT. “It was all about how do you elevate the business based on the great foundation it already has.” But the emphasis on rich clients borrowing more, trading more and taking on more sophisticated products has raised concerns that UBS is taking on riskier business for the sake of bigger profits. It was a strategy Khan pursued with vigour as head of the wealth business at Credit Suisse until his dramatic departure two years ago after falling out with the group’s then chief executive Tidjane Thiam. Since the launch of Elevate in January 2020, invested assets in UBS’s wealth arm have ballooned by $595 billion, more than the total assets under management of Switzerland’s third-largest bank, Julius Baer, which Khan was close to joining as chief executive before switching to UBS. More 
While there is this deep-rooted tradition of respect of the environment in Switzerland it does not necessarily extend beyond the country's borders.  Meanwhile, UBS has lent an additional $49 billion to its clients over the past 18 months, with more specialised, higher-margin lending becoming a small but growing part of the business. “In the current environment, this strategy is working and working well,” said a senior executive at a rival Swiss bank. “But are they able to manage risk and reduce leverage if volatility picks up and there is a strong correction in the market? “This is the proof we don’t yet have and will tell us whether they are doing a good job or not.” The series of scandals engulfing Credit Suisse since Khan’s departure — including the $5.5 billion loss on the collapse of family office Archegos Capital and liquidation of $10 billion of funds linked to specialist finance firm Greensill Capital — point to the dangers of neglecting risk controls in the pursuit of profitable clients. UBS has had its own share of issues. It was hit by $861 million of losses from Archegos, having offered prime brokerage services to the business run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang. And the decision of a French court on September 27 over whether the bank should pay up to €4.5 billion in penalties for helping rich clients evade paying tax also looms. While Elevate has produced strong results for UBS so far, critics are sceptical about whether it can keep going. “Elevate has been about grabbing low-hanging fruit up till now,” said a former UBS executive. “The big question is, what’s next?” The plan to increase lending predated Khan’s arrival. But one of the first things he did when he joined was convince the group’s executive board to extend more credit to UBS’s richest clients and give them more flexibility in trading. “Some people will say you guys are pushing lending now,” said Naratil. “We don’t push lending — our clients borrow. They just don’t borrow as much from us as we would like.”

Last year Khan poached one of his senior lieutenants at Credit Suisse, Remi Mennesson, to lead a new global financing team at UBS, which straddled the wealth management business and investment bank.  The UBS team was set up to offer a faster service to its richest clients, but also to explore more sophisticated lending. Rather than traditional forms of credit, such as mortgages and Lombard lending — which use the borrower’s listed securities as collateral — the so-called structured loans that Mennesson’s unit specialises in use illiquid assets, such as stakes in private companies, as collateral. Though such loans can command higher interest rates for the bank — up to double earned from Lombard lending — they are also riskier.  The majority of UBS’s lending to rich clients has taken place in the US, where Naratil said UBS is finding more demand for specialised lending. “More and more wealth is created from entrepreneurs in the new economy and companies staying private for longer,” he added.  Khan had focused Credit Suisse’s lending strategy on extending credit to the bank’s wealthy Asian clients. Among the recipients was Lu Zhengyao, chair of Chinese Starbucks rival Luckin Coffee. Thiam once feted Zhengyao as a “dream client” and “absolutely the poster child for what we want to do”. Credit Suisse had sponsored Luckin’s IPO in May 2019 but when Luckin Coffee’s shares plunged 82% last April following allegations of a $310 million fraud, Zhengyao’s family company defaulted on a $518 million margin loan. Credit Suisse was one of a handful of banks that provided the syndicated loan. More

Swiss retail banks are the most profitable in terms of profit per customer among wealthy nations, according to an international ranking.  UBS has offered relatively few structured loans so far, accounting for less than 5% of the $49 billion of gross loans provided this year. By contrast, around a quarter of Credit Suisse’s wealth loan book is in structured lending. However, in another ill-fated deal, both UBS and Credit Suisse, along with JPMorgan, jointly offered WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann a $500 million personal loan that used his WeWork stake as collateral before the group’s failed IPO in 2019. Since Ralph Hamers replaced Sergio Ermotti as UBS chief executive 10 months ago, he has presided over a period of strong growth, though analysts and shareholders have been underwhelmed by his lack of grand strategy. Khan and Naratil, however, back Hamers, saying their business has benefited from his focus on putting clients’ needs first and improving efficiency through digitisation.  But at one stage all three were fighting for the top job. And the success of Elevate will stand Khan and Naratil in good stead when the position next becomes open — but if the risks prove unmanageable then the pair could also fall.

More and more blockchain companies are starting up their business in Switzerland using cryptocurrency start-up capital.  Start-ups that are chosen to go through CV VC’s three-month kickstart programme will each receive $125,000 in seed funding. Later stage financing for the most promising projects will be decided on a case-by-case basis. In return, the young companies will give CV VC a stake in their business of up to 8% in the shape of shares or digital tokens. Working out of the established CV Labs co-working space in Zug, the start-ups will receive support and mentoring from a team of experienced business and technology consultants. While CV VC will be based in Switzerland, it plans to operate on a global scale and is currently seeking new investors from around the world to help it set up future incubators in other countries. “Blockchain technology is a global phenomenon so we could expand anywhere in the world,” said CV VC co-founder Mathias Ruch on Thursday. Many blockchain start-ups have ridden the wave of the initial coin offering (ICO) crowd investing boom over the last 18 months. This source of funding has generated billions of dollars in previously untapped capital. But ICOs have also been criticized for spiraling out of control, with a spate of failed start-ups destroying a large chunk of the capital raised from the public. Ruch, who founded the Lakeside Partners consulting group (that will be merged into CV VC), is convinced that the worlds of ICOs and traditional initial public offering (IPO) funding will merge into a new model of start-up financing with better checks and balances to protect both companies and investors. This thought was echoed by Vasiliy Suvorov, CV VC advisor and vice-president of the Crypto Valley Association. “ICOs will continue to be a useful mechanism but they will no longer be core to the blockchain economy,” he said. “We have had all the hype about ICOs, and now we need a model that takes all these great technology ideas and brings them into the real economy.” Crypto Valley has already seen some 600 blockchain companies establish in region, both home-grown and foreign imports. These include Xapo, Bitcoin Suisse and Shapeshift. * Correction: the original version of this text wrongly stated that the goal was to produce 1,000 companies every year. More

While the main topic of the meeting, which was eagerly awaited by Turkey and attended by leading businessmen and state officials, was ""Balancing, Discipline and Change"", the steps to be taken in this context were gathered under 7 different headings. A detail under the targets on Growth and Employment, which is the fifth of these titles, did not escape attention.
 
 Minister Albayrak announced live! Here is the 'New Economy Program'
 
According to the news of Mahmut Ekinci from Milliyet, the following statements were included in the third article of the Policy and Measures regarding Growth and Employment on the 17th page of the report shared on the official website of the Ministry of Treasury and Finance:

 
An Initial Public Offering (IPO), or more commonly known as an ""IPO,"" can be defined as the sale of stocks to called investors. While companies provide financing to themselves with this method, they make the investors a partner of the company by selling shares.

ICO, or Initial Coin Offering, is a concept that comes to the fore with cryptocurrencies. The difference of the ICO, which is just like the IPO, is that the thing to be invested in is not a company, but a cryptocurrency that has not yet appeared in the markets. Cryptocurrencies that will enter the market begin to collect financing by calling potential investors during their ICO period. The ICO then takes the form of cryptocurrencies by being traded on the stock market or used in trades.
This remarkable detail in the report published by the Ministry is interpreted as a development that increases the possibility of seeing a state-supported domestic cryptocurrency in the coming period.
 
 
             ""From October, inflation will start to decline""
 
 
 




ICO software developer Erkan Kule said:

“ICO is a good idea and entrepreneurs who need the necessary financing to realize this idea directly ask for funds from investors before the project is even launched. A well-known Ethereum is a good example. Ethereum ICO, a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency platform developed by Vitalik Buterin, invests $ 15 million. Last year alone, $8 billion was invested in ICOs.
 
             ""7 million new jobs created""
 
 


The FileCoin ICO example, which does the job of sharing the excess capacity of users' computers, broke a record in this field with $ 250 million.
The fact that the Ministry has brought this issue to the agenda means that the state now sees ICO as a financing tool for the financing of new ventures in Turkey, and probably the necessary legal arrangements are on the way.""

Saudi Aramco aims to announce the start of its initial public
offering (IPO) on Nov. 3, three people with direct knowledge of the
matter told Reuters, after delaying the deal earlier this
month to give advisers time to secure cornerstone investors,
Trend reports.
Separately, Aramco has not approached the Kuwait Investment
Authority (KIA) to invest in the IPO, the sovereign wealth fund’s

IPO, and KIA will look at the IPO like any other investment,”
Bastaki told reporters on the sidelines of an investment conference

Nasser, was not present at the conference on Tuesday as he was
meeting investors abroad ahead of the offering.
Aramco, in response to queries by Reuters, said on Tuesday the
oil company “does not comment on rumour or speculation. The company
continues to engage with the shareholders on IPO readiness
activities. The company is ready and timing will depend on market
conditions and be at a time of the shareholders’ choosing.”
The people declined to be identified due to commercial
sensitivities.
Aramco will start subscription for investors in its initial
public offering on Dec. 4, Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya said
in a news flash on Tuesday citing sources.
The oil giant plans to announce the transaction’s price on Nov.

market, the Tadawul, on Dec. 11, the broadcaster reported.
The company will soon have more shareholders from institutions,

Saudi Arabia's Capital Market Authority approves IPO of oil giant Aramco,https://www.azernews.az/region/158089.html, 3 November 2019 14:44 (UTC+04:00),2022-07-21 12:06:17.579526,"
By Trend
Saudi Arabia’s Capital Market Authority (CMA) has approved the
initial public offering of state oil giant Aramco, in a move that
the CMA said would be valid for at least six months, Trend reports citing Sputnik.
In a statement on Sunday, the CMA also said that Aramco’s
prospectus is due to be published in the run-up to the beginning of
the subscription period.
The move comes a day after Reuters cited unnamed sources as
saying that “Crown Prince [Mohammed bin Salman] finally gave the
green light” to Aramco’s IPO.
Plans for the decision were first announced in 2016 as part of
Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 economic overhaul programme but have
been delayed a number of times.
Riyadh reportedly expects the IPO to value the oil giant at some
$2 trillion, the largest such valuation in history, which would
allow the company to raise as much as $100 billion by listing just
a 5 percent stake.

The oil facilities belonging to Aramco were attacked in
mid-September, which resulted in a temporary sharp decrease in the
kingdom's oil output.

Saudi Aramco is close to selecting banks for its IPO,https://www.azernews.az/region/155527.html, 4 September 2019 16:55 (UTC+04:00),2022-07-21 12:06:19.082088,"

Saudi Aramco aims to select underwriters for its initial public
offering as soon as this week, as the state energy giant
accelerates preparations for the world's biggest share sale,
reports Trend referring to Aljazeera.com.
Global investment banks are finishing up a week of pitches that
started last Tuesday in Dhahran, the eastern Saudi city where
Aramco is based, according to the people. Some firms seeking a role
on the deal made presentations in Dubai or London, the people said.
Aramco plans to tell banks later this week or early next week
whether they got a role on the offering, the people said, asking
not to be identified because the information is private.
Aramco is expected to choose about four or five banks to lead
the IPO marketing as joint global coordinators, while a larger
number will work on the deal in more junior capacities, the people
said. It is considering selling shares on the Saudi stock exchange
as soon as late this year or early next year, with a potential
international listing at a later date, the people said.
Top officials from the exchanges in London, New York and Hong
Kong have been pitching to host the IPO, Bloomberg News has
reported.
The oil producer has told Saudi investment banks that it will
invite pitches around the end of this month from local underwriters
seeking a role on the company's domestic listing, the people said.
A number of options are being considered, and no final decisions
have been made on the structure of the deal, according to the
people.

Aramco, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., didn't
immediately respond to a request for comment. The company recently
said it ""continues to engage"" with its owner on ""IPO readiness
activities"" and is ready for a share sale that will take place ""at
a time of the shareholder's choosing.""

Despite market volatility, Volkswagen is still working toward an
initial public offering (IPO) for Porsche in the fourth quarter

carmaker's finance chief said on Wednesday, Trend reports with reference to Reuters.
""We are optimistic we can pursue this project in the fourth
quarter,"" Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz said at the Reuters
Automotive Europe conference in Munich. ""Porsche would gain
entrepreneurial freedom, we can expect a lot from them.""
He added there was still plenty of investor appetite and capital
available for an IPO.

Oil gains amid push by Saudi Arabia for further supply cuts,https://www.azernews.az/oil_and_gas/159169.html, 3 December 2019 10:28 (UTC+04:00),2022-07-21 12:06:21.183152,"
By Trend
Oil prices rose on Tuesday, as OPEC and its allies discuss
whether to deepen a supply cut pact ahead of meetings this week,
although prospects after Saudi Arabia’s planned listing of Aramco
fuelled uncertainty for traders, limiting gains, Trend with reference to Reuters reports.
Brent futures LCOv1 rose 13 cents, or 0.2%, to $61.05 a barrel
by 0424 GMT, after gaining 0.7% on Monday.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 was up by 20 cents, or
0.4%, at $56.16 a barrel. The contract rose 1.4% on Monday.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and
its allies, a group known as OPEC+, are discussing a plan to
increase an existing supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day
(bpd) by a further 400,000 bpd and extend the pact until June, two
sources familiar with the matter said.
Saudi Arabia is pushing the plan to deliver a positive surprise
to the market before the initial public offering (IPO) of
state-owned Saudi Aramco, the sources said.
The “oil price is little moved today, suggesting that traders
are sceptical about the additional 400,000 bpd cut on top of the
extension of (the) current production cut agreement,” said Margaret
Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore.
“The question is what they are going to do after the Aramco IPO
and that creates uncertainty for the oil prices,” Yang said.
OPEC ministers will meet in Vienna on Thursday and the wider
OPEC+ group will gather on Friday.
Concerns about the inability of the United States and China, the
world’s two biggest oil users, to reach a preliminary deal to
resolve their 17-month trade dispute also weighed on oil prices,
along with discouraging U.S. economic data.
A senior adviser to President Donald Trump said a U.S.-China
trade deal was still possible before the end of the year, adding
that the first phase of the agreement was being put to paper, but
the talks have been dragging on for weeks now.
And while OPEC may cut output, U.S. producers have been only to
happy to match any market shortfalls, with production setting
successive records. Growth into 2020, though, may range between
100,000 bpd and 1 million bpd.
U.S. crude inventories are expected to have declined last week,
which may support prices, with analysts in a preliminary Reuters
polls suggesting a contraction of 1.8 million barrels.
In a sign of buying interest for oil, fund managers increased
net long positions in U.S. crude futures and options in the week to
Nov. 26, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission said.

"Saudi Aramco confirms to sell 0.5 pct to retail investors, lockup period for government",https://www.azernews.az/region/158329.html, 10 November 2019 12:12 (UTC+04:00),2022-07-21 12:06:23.647455,"
By Trend
State-owned Saudi Aramco will sell 0.5% of its shares to
individual shareholders and the government will have a lockup
period of at least six months on further share sales after the
initial public offering, its prospectus said on Saturday.
The over 600-page prospectus did not include details of how much
of the company would be floated or any commitments from anchor
investors.
Aramco fired the starting gun on the initial public offering
(IPO) on Nov. 3 after a series of false starts. Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to raise billions of dollars to
diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in
non-energy industries

Oil prices slip as demand concerns outweigh efforts to curb supply,https://www.azernews.az/region/154768.html, 13 August 2019 14:57 (UTC+04:00),2022-07-21 12:06:24.665997,"
By Trend
Oil prices slipped on Tuesday, offsetting narrow gains in the
previous session, as sluggish demand forecasts countered
expectations that major producers would prop up oil prices by
limiting crude oil output, reports Trend referring to Reuters.
International benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 were down 18
cents or 0.3%, from the previous settlement, to $58.39 a barrel by
0310 GMT.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 futures were at $54.81
per barrel, down by 12 cents, or 0.2%, from the last close.
“Although the outlook remains bleak, oil prices have remained
anchored this week after a rapid response from Saudi Arabia, who is
serious about stepping in to defend the oil price,” Stephen Innes,
managing partner at VM Markets Pte Ltd said in a note.
Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said late last week it plans
to keep its crude oil exports below 7 million barrels per day in
August and September to help drain global oil inventories.
Analysts expect the country to support prices ahead of its plans
to float Saudi Aramco, in what could be the world’s largest initial
public offering (IPO).
Saudi Aramco was ready for its IPO, but the timing for the deal
will be decided by its sole shareholder, the Saudi government, a
senior executive said on Monday.
Kuwait on Monday also reiterated its commitment to OPEC+ supply
curbs after Oil Minister Khaled al-Fadhel said Kuwait had cut its
own output by more than required by the accord.
OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, have agreed to cut 1.2
million barrels per day (bpd) since Jan. 1.
But booming U.S. shale oil production continues to chip away at
efforts to limit the global supply overhang, weighing on
prices.
U.S. oil output from seven major shale formations is expected to
rise by 85,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September, to a record 8.77
million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecast in
a report.
Gloomy forecasts for the global economy and oil demand growth
have also dragged on oil prices as the trade dispute between the
United States and China escalates.
“The swift reaction from Saudi Arabia will likely stabilize oil
prices, but the oil price probably won’t move much above $60 per
barrel until there is evidence of progress in U.S.-China trade
negotiations,” said Innes.
China’s central bank lowered its official yuan midpoint for the
ninth straight day to a fresh 11-year low on Tuesday to reflect
broad weakness in the local unit.
A lower yuan raises the cost of dollar-denominated oil imports
in China, the world’s biggest crude oil importer.

Coinbase IPO: Bitcoin Investors Must Expect More Government Scrutiny Of Crypto,https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO2104/S00159/coinbase-ipo-bitcoin-investors-must-expect-more-government-scrutiny-of-crypto.htm,"Thursday, 15 April 2021,  5:56 am",2022-07-21,"
Bitcoin investors should be braced for – but not put
off by – “much greater government scrutiny,” warns the
boss of one of the world’s largest independent financial
advisory and fintech organizations.The warning from
Nigel Green, CEO and founder of deVere Group, comes on the
day Coinbase, the biggest cryptocurrency platform in the
U.S., prepares for its public debut.It launches its
initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq under the symbol
COIN starting on Wednesday.On Tuesday on the deVere
Crypto app, Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by
market capitalization, hit all-time highs of
$64,000.Mr Green says: “Coinbase’s direct listing
is a truly momentous day for the
cryptoverse.“Should it hit its private market
valuation of $100 billion, it would immediately become one
of the 85 most valuable companies in the U.S.“Of
course, this is driven by the fact the world’s two biggest
cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, to which Coinbase is
intrinsically linked, have risen 800% and 1,300%
respectively over the last year.”He continues:
“But with these astronomical price jumps, and as they
become increasingly embedded in the global financial system,
and, critically, as the direct listing on the Nasdaq will
reach a wider investment base other than the usual crypto
evangelists, investors must expect much greater government
scrutiny.“Governments, central banks and regulators
will be keen to protect the currency status quo.











“We
should expect considerably higher levels of regulation in
the crypto market. Indeed, I believe it is
inevitable.”Mr Green goes on to add: “However,
Bitcoin investors shouldn’t be put off by the likelihood
of greater government scrutiny.“Major draconian
clampdowns are unlikely as digital currencies are
increasingly regarded as the future of money – even by
traditionalists. They can’t put the genie back in the
bottle.“Indeed, proportionate regulation should be
embraced. It would help protect investors, shore-up the
market, tackle criminality, and reduce the potential
possibility of disrupting global financial stability, as
well as offering a potential long-term economic boost to
those countries which introduce it.”The deVere CEO
concludes: “The Coinbase IPO underscores that
cryptocurrencies in some form or another are here to stay
– and the market is only set to grow.“Because of
this, investors should know that regulation will become a
greater
priority.”

Lithium battery startup files for IPO in Hong Kong,https://supchina.com/2022/03/15/lithium-battery-startup-files-for-ipo-in-hong-kong/,"March 15, 2022",2022-07-21 12:08:57.886433,"

CALB Co. Ltd. 卡尔吧, one of China’s largest electric vehicle battery makers, has filed for a Hong Kong IPO on the back of soaring electric vehicle sales in China. According to CALB’s IPO prospectus, the proceeds will go to expand equipment research and testing facilities for battery trials.


In 2021, CALB controlled 5.9% of China’s battery installation market, making it the country’s third-largest domestic supplier.

The Jiangsu-based enterprise has dug its way out of a loss in recent years. In 2020, CALB posted a total loss of 18.3 million yuan ($2.8 million). However, last year, the company garnered profits to the tune of 111.5 million yuan ($17.5 million), increasing total revenue by 141% year-on-year.

CALB already ranks in the top 10 in the world by manufacturing capacity. Forecasts predict that by 2025, the company could move up a notch to become China’s second-largest supplier.

The context: As a top battery supplier for EVs, CALB’s success parallels the explosion of China’s electric vehicle market. Over 70% of CALB’s soaring 2021 revenue came from battery sales to Xpeng Inc., Aiways, and GAC, among others.


China sold a total of 3 million electric vehicles last year, compared with 800,000 in the U.S. Part of the reason for China’s enormous EV sales volume is its domestic market price range. For instance, low-end electric vehicles start around $4,000, making them affordable for most Chinese consumers.

China is expanding its electric vehicle operations globally. Currently, about a dozen Chinese EV makers have operations in Europe. Regardless of Europe’s 10% car import tariff, many Chinese firms still maintain price competition with European manufacturers.



However: CALB has an Achilles heel. Until 2015, the firm was tied to the state-owned Aviation Industry Corp. of China, a supplier of defensive military equipment. As battery technological capabilities expand and geopolitical tensions continue to escalate, CALB may be caught in the  crossfire.

In the last decade, entrepreneurs like Yang Guo Fu, many of whom are not from malatang’s home province of Sichuan, have turned the street food item into an urban fast food staple. Some of the chains have spread internationally, offering global consumers a taste of the unique spicy, numbing sensation of Sichuan peppercorns and dried chillies.
Like long-time rivals McDonald’s and KFC, Yang Guo Fu shares the top industry spot with Zhang Liang, another Harbin-based spicy hotpot chain with more than 5,800 stores worldwide. The two are the only chains in the sector to go global.
Spicy hotpot chains have proliferated of late following Yang Guo Fu’s success. There’s Cuanyue Spicy Hotpot (founded by Yang’s brother), Mijie Spicy Hotpot, and Little Barbarian Pepper.

The takeaway: Yang Guo Fu is part of a wave of Chinese IPOs in the food and beverage sector of late that centers on traditional Chinese delicacies from noodles to hotpot.
On Friday, another fast food chain Hefu Noodle announced a plan to list its shares overseas. Other IPO hopefuls include the Sichuan-based Country Style Cooking, Anhui-based Home Original Chicken, and Henan-based Banu Hotpot. Legacy American brands like KFC are facing heavy competition.

The successful completion of the Public Offer and the trust received from investors give us the opportunity to continue the path of expanding and consolidating the Aquila business to another level,â said Jean Dumitrescu, Investor Relations Director, Aquila.The new shares sold in the IPO represent a third of the companyâs total number of shares after the transaction. Aquila was thus valued at EUR 222 mln, which is 18.3 times more than the net profit reported for 2020 - EUR 12.1 mln.Local brokerage firm Swiss Capital managed the IPO and BRK Financial Group and Tradeville were distribution agents.

Romania's Electrica IPO guide: main benefits for small individual investors,https://www.romania-insider.com/romanias-electrica-ipo-guide-main-benefits-for-small-individual-investors,2014-06-13,21-07-2022,"Small individual investors who will subscribe on the small tranche of Romanian electricity distributor Electrica initial public offering (IPO) will have the option to choose between having their orders guaranteed up to 1,000 shares or getting a 5 percent discount to the final IPO price, according to the prospectus. The procedure, however, is not the easiest.The tranche for small investors in the Electrica IPO is 7 percent of the total number of shares sold by the company. That is 12.4 million shares out of a total of 177.19 million shares. The price interval for the IPO is RON 11 to 13.5 per share.Subscriptions for the small retail tranche start at a minimum of 250 shares and go up to 20,000 shares. When making the subscription, investors must pay the maximum price per share of RON 13.5. At the end of the IPO period, which is June 16-25, the price of the IPO will be set based on subscriptions made by institutional investors, who get 85 percent of the total shares.Retail investors will pay the same price as institutional investors. For example, if this price is RON 12 per share, small investors will get back the difference of RON 1.5 per share.Small investors who make their subscriptions in the first five days of the offering period (up until and including June 20) will get a 5 percent discount to the final price. Again, as an example, if the price is RON 12, then the discounted price would be RON 11.4. However, investors who choose to have their subscriptions guaranteed do not get the discount.Investors can choose to have their subscriptions guaranteed up to 1,000 shares. In this case, the advantage is that they know from the start how many shares they will get in the IPO, so the allocation ratio is one on one. A maximum of 10 million shares will be set aside for guaranteed subscriptions, with a first come, first served policy.Itâs uncertain if an investor who wants to subscribe between 250 and 1,000 shares can also choose not to have his subscriptions guaranteed, in order to get the discount. However, in this case he could get significantly less shares than the number he applies for, because the allocation will be pro-rata. So if the non-guaranteed portion of the tranche is five time oversubscribed for example, he will get only 20 percent of the shares he subscribed.Small investors who want to subscribe more than 1,000 shares also have more options. For example, someone who wants to subscribe 10,000 shares can make two orders, one for 1,000 shares with guaranteed subscription, and one for 9,000 shares non-guaranteed, for which he gets the 5 percent discount. He can also go with a single order for 10,000 shares non-guaranteed.Itâs not the easiest subscription procedure and investors will have to be very careful how they structure their orders in order to get the expected results. Assistance from a broker would prove useful, but even among brokers there are different interpretations given to the prospect. Hopefully all these will be clarified by Monday, June 16, when the offer starts.Investors in Romania can subscribe in the Electrica IPO through BRD, Raiffeisen Bank and brokerage firm Swiss Capital, which are members of the intermediary consortium. But most local brokerage firms can also receive subscriptions from investors which they pass forward to the syndicate.More details in the IPO prospectus.Andrei Chirileasa, andrei@romania-insider.comÂ"

The offer consists of 177 million new shares, representing 105 percent of the companyâs total number of existing shares. They include shares and GDRs (global depository receipts), with one GDR standing for four shares, the company announced.During the last two weeks, the managers of the offering were engaged in the pre-marketing activities for the IPO, which means they contacted potential investors and presented them the company while at the same time asking them how many shares Â they would be interested to buy and at what price. Based on that feedback from investors, they established the price range for the offering.This price range remains to be harmonized with the Governmentâs expectations, which still requires some negotiations. Following these negotiations, which should end today (June 10), the official price range will be presented on Wednesdayâs weekly Government meeting for approval.The offering price cannot, by law, be lower than the sharesâ face value, which is RON 10, which means that the offering will for sure be larger than RON 1.77 billion (EUR 400 million). This will make it larger than the Romgaz IPO last year, in which the Romania state sold 15 percent of the company for EUR 390 million.After it gets the Governmentâs approval, the price will be filled up in the IPO prospectus, which should then be approved by the Romanian Financial Supervision Authority ASF. After this step, the prospectus should be made public, either on Wednesday evening or on Thursday this week. The prospectus will be available on the Electrica website, on the Bucharest Stock Exchange website, but on sites of the intermediaries as well.The consortium which manages the Electrica IPO consists of Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Raiffeisen Bank Romania and SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Corporate & Investment Banking, who are joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the offer, BRD-Groupe SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale (Romania) as manager, and local brokerage firm Swiss Capital, as distribution agent.Andrei Chirileasa, andrei@romania-insider.com"

20.07.2022 13:27 ",2022-07-21,"Стартапы – это часто прекрасные разработки. Но чтобы результаты креативных идей стали востребованы, их необходимо дорастить. Доращивание технологических компаний происходит благодаря федеральному проекту «Взлёт от стартапа до IPO» (входит в госпрограмму «Экономическое развитие и инновационная экономика»).  Его цель – создать условия для появления в России новых технологических лидеров.  С нынешнего года российские IT-компании могут получить гранты на доработку своей продукции под требования крупных корпораций-заказчиков и воспользоваться государственной поддержкой на льготных условиях. Государство поможет бизнесу на всех этапах его становления: от идеи до первой публичной продажи акций. Этапов этих выделено три.  Первый – массовая предакселерация команд (от идеи до первых продаж) и акселерация (когда новый бизнес начинает приносить выручку). Здесь действуют институты инновационного развития, в том числе фонд «Сколково», Фонд содействия инновациям и Платформы НТИ, а также используются традиционные инструменты поддержки, среди которых гранты и обучение предпринимателей. Второй этап – развитие зрелых стартапов. Поддержка оказывается компаниям с выручкой от 100 млн руб. через такие инструменты, как льготное кредитование. Его уже сейчас предоставляют МСП-банк и Корпорация МСП. В общей сложности порядка 40 млрд руб. получат более 200 малых и средних инновационных компаний за 3 года. Третий этап – поддержка стабильного бизнеса, то есть компаний с выручкой от 500 млн руб. – поможет провести IPO (Initial Public Offering – первое публичное размещение акций на бирже). В Министерстве цифрового развития уверены, что проект позволит увеличить количество публичных технологических компаний в России. На сам процесс IPO Фонд содействия инновациям предоставит субсидии в размере до 50% затрат (для получения выручка не должна быть менее 800 млн руб.). По стратегической инициативе «Взлёт от стартапа до IPO», которая соответствует задачам национального проекта «Малое и среднее предпринимательство», и реализация которой завершится к 2030 г., будет работать так называемый бесшовный механизм господдержки. Это значит, что благодаря единой цифровой среде институты развития станут обмениваться между собой необходимой информацией о компании и результатах её деятельности и оперативно предоставлять меры поддержки.

30.05.2022 15:31 ",2022-07-21,"Жители республики Башкирия, а также Псковской и Новосибирской областей, о которых мы решили рассказать, вряд ли даже знакомы друг с другом. Но похожи — своей решительностью и желанием зарабатывать деньги так, чтобы дело приносило максимальную пользу обществу. Анастасия и Максим познакомились в Нижнем Новгороде, когда учились в военно-медицинском институте. Работали в воинской части, а потом перебрались в Великие Луки, откуда родом Максим Князьков. Когда в семье родился пятый ребенок, многодетные супруги получили участок и решили построить там собственный дом. Идею собственного дела «придумала жизнь» — супруги-медработники (она — эндокринолог, он — хирург-онколог) достаточно часто встречали людей с ограниченными возможностями. И выяснили, что среди таких граждан, особенно колясочников, достаточно много желающих путешествовать. Поэтому Князьковы решили создать гостевой домик для маломобильных людей. Домик с доступной средой «Ласточкин сад» — уникальный проект не только для Великих Лук. И проект почти сразу же по достоинству оценили. Семья Князьковых в декабре 2021 года стала победителем регионального этапа всероссийского конкурса «Лучший социальный проект года-2021» в номинации «Лучший проект социального предпринимательства в сфере поддержки и реабилитации людей с ограниченными возможностями здоровья». 1 мая 2022 года домик торжественно открылся для посетителей. Его особенности видны сразу: вход оборудован пандусом, полы внутри помещений уложены без порогов, установлены подоконники низкого уровня. Также для отдыхающих обустроен комфортный проезд к кухне. На втором этаже расположена спальня, где с удобством смогут разместиться люди, сопровождающие своих подопечных, детей или родственников. На территории, прилегающей к домику, Князьковы разбили большой сад: просторные дорожки с твердым покрытием, зону барбекю, широкие прогулочные зоны с твердым покрытием, уложили каменную сенсорную дорожку. Участок полностью засажен различными цветами, ягодами, травами, хвойными и лиственными деревьями. На территории есть даже специальные приподнятые грядки, к которым легко подъехать людям-колясочникам и своими руками что-то посадить. Кроме того, на заднем дворе установлена детская водная площадка, которую разработали воспитанники детского технопарка «Кванториум». «Проект гостевого домика развивается с 2019 года силами нашей большой семьи, с поддержкой бизнес-инкубатора «Новация», — рассказала Анастасия. — В прошлом году мы получили грантовую поддержку от общества инвалидов «Ковчег» (г. Калининград), Комитета по экономическому развитию Псковской области и Центра инноваций социальной сферы региона, который работает благодаря поддержке национального проекта «Малое и среднее предпринимательство». Пока не до конца решен лишь вопрос с логистикой: семьям людей с ограниченными возможностями нужен транспорт, чтобы добраться с вокзала до микрорайона Лаврино, где расположен домик. Сибирячка Олеся Сизых очень долго искала своё дело. Лишившись работы во время кризиса 2008 года, начала бизнес просто чтобы как-то выбраться из сложной ситуации. Вместе с будущим мужем Константином они основали компанию по продаже крепежей для строительной и производственных сфер. «Бизнес начали в собственной кухне с капиталом 30 тыс. рублей, через месяц сняли офис и начали расширяться», — вспоминает Олеся. Всё началось с известных каждому предпринимателю и продавцу «холодных звонков» — когда приходится беспокоить людей, которые твоего звонка вовсе не ждут и тебе не рады. И предлагать им свой ""уникальный товар""». Все это время бизнесвумен не переставала учиться. Курсы бухгалтеров, руководителей торговых предприятий, осваивала документооборот и программное обеспечение. Все рекламные навыки она применяла в собственном бизнесе. «Мой первый миллион я заработала на нашем уникальном торговом предложении — химическом крепеже, это когда вылетают другие элементы, заливается химия и ставятся суперпрочные шпильки. Мы были его первыми продавцами в Новосибирской области», ― вспоминает девушка. До 2020 года компания работала в качестве оптового поставщика с промышленными и строительными объектами Сибирского федерального округа, включая работу по контрактам с ресурсоснабжающими организациями. Осенью 2020 Олеся узнала о национальном проекте «Малое и среднее предпринимательство» Министерства промышленности и торговли Новосибирской области и «Школе торговли» местного центра «Мой бизнес». И снова пошла учиться. На одной из лекций она познакомилась со спикерами — представителями одного из крупнейших интернет-маркетплейсов. Олесе пришла в голову идея продавать крепёж по-новому. «Сидя на заднем ряду, я нарисовала в блокноте центра ""Мой бизнес"" схему упаковки, варианты фасовки и прибежала в офис с круглыми глазами, с криком «Мы будем продавать на ""Озон""!», — вспоминает девушка. ― Коллеги не верили. Я же ночами изучала возможности маркетплейса. Навыки маркетинга и рекламы позволили мне все просчитать и упаковать новый продукт. А учёба в ""Моем бизнесе"" ― исправить ошибки». В итоге к концу 2020 года заработал интернет-магазин Олеси и Константина, где пригодились рекламные навыки. Осенью 2021 года бизнес вышел на новый уровень, пришлось набирать команду и учиться работать на новых площадках. «Хороший специалист — это не тот, кто не совершает ошибок, а тот, кто умеет их признавать и исправлять», — считает Олеся.	


Льготные кредиты и гранты. Меры поддержки для предпринимателей в России

 Предприниматель Айрат Ишмияров из Стерлитамакского района известен в Башкортостане как «грибной фермер». Несколько лет назад он открыл свое фермерское хозяйство — начал выращивать шампиньоны и трюфели. Сначала вместе с супругой Айгуль они выращивали грибы в подвале своего дома. Позже, когда бизнес начал развиваться и появился спрос на продукцию, фермер выкупил здание бывшего кормоцеха животноводческого комплекса. Сельский предприниматель принял участие в госпрограмме «Агростартап», (которая реализуется по региональной программе «Акселерация субъектов малого и среднего предпринимательства» национального проекта «Малое и среднее предпринимательство и поддержка индивидуальной предпринимательской инициативы»). Айрат успешно прошел конкурсные испытания и выиграл грант в 3 млн руб. На эти деньги фермер обустроил производственное помещение. «Для выращивания грибов очень важен микроклимат, — объясняет фермер. — Температура воздуха в инкубационном цехе должна быть на уровне +18 градусов Цельсия, влажность должна достигать 86-90%. Важно контролировать и содержание углекислого газа. Сейчас на ферме есть все необходимое оборудование». Раз в месяц на грибной ферме снимают урожай по 3-3,5 тонны, а в год — более 30 тонн. Субстрат для их выращивания Ишмияров закупает в Туле и Ижевске. Грибная продукция поставляется в Стерлитамак, Салават и Ишимбай как в свежем, так и в маринованном видах. В основном это места общественного питания, рынки и оптовые точки. Предприниматель планирует развивать «грибное дело», открыть цех по консервации и переработке шампиньонов, выйти на рынки Уфы и других городов республики. Выращивание грибов уже стало семейным делом: в сборе, доставке и продаже товара участвует супруга Айгуль. И уже начали помогать родителям их сыновья — Искандер и Тагир.

26.05.2022 09:00 ",2022-07-21,"26 мая в России отмечается День российского предпринимательства — праздник, утвержденный Президентом Российской Федерации 18 октября 2007 года и объединяющий предпринимателей со всей страны. В этот день в стране ежегодно проходят крупные мероприятия, призванные поддержать бизнес, обозначить его значимость и важность, а также вовлечь жителей страны в предпринимательскую деятельность. По мнению председателя Правительства России Михаила Мишустина, рост малого и среднего бизнеса — одна из ключевых задач, которую нужно решить в рамках достижения национальных целей, поставленных Президентом России. «На небольших предприятиях получает заработную плату примерно каждый третий работник в нашей стране. От процессов, которые происходят в этом секторе, во многом зависят и темпы развития экономики в целом. Ведь многие свежие идеи, новаторские решения появляются именно в этом сегменте: в малом и среднем бизнесе», — считает он.  Сегодня все больше людей стремятся начать свое дело, так, например, предприниматели открывают компании и масштабируют производства, развивают экспорт и выходят на новые рынки сбыта, открывают рестораны, запускают агробизнес. Многие граждане регистрируются как самозанятые, осваивая и пробуя себя в новых сферах. На сегодняшний день в России насчитывается более 6 млн субъектов малого и среднего предпринимательства и около 5 млн самозанятых граждан, что практически в два раза превышает запланированные показатели национального проекта «Малое и среднее предпринимательство» к 2030 году. Зарегистрироваться в качестве самозанятого могут граждане, получающие доход от своей профессиональной деятельности и не имеющие работодателя и наемных работников. Для самозанятых установлена минимальная ставка налога — 4% при работе с физическими лицами и 6% — с юридическими и индивидуальными предпринимателями. Для вновь зарегистрировавшихся самозанятых предусмотрен разовый налоговый вычет в размере 10 тыс. рублей, который они могут направить на оплату будущих налогов. Они также освобождены от обязанности платить страховые взносы, сдавать налоговые декларации и отчеты, использовать кассовую технику, а чеки формируются в мобильном приложении «Мой налог». Кроме того, на самозанятых распространено большинство мер поддержки, ранее доступных только субъектам МСП.  Наиболее популярные среди населения меры поддержки по национальному проекту — это обучающие программы для предпринимателей, предоставляемая помощь в центрах «Мой Бизнес», а также льготное кредитование.

02.02.2022 12:19 ",2022-07-21,"​Прямые инвестиции в малый и средний бизнес с участием лид-инвестора сегодня называют революцией в инновационных продуктах. Почему? Количество людей, которые стремятся заработать на инвестициях, растет в геометрической прогрессии и это приводит к снижению средней доходности большинства инвест-направлений. Так, давно уже перестала быть «кузницей миллионеров» фондовая биржа: ее средняя доходность (8-10% годовых) едва покрывает инфляцию. Коммерческая недвижимость приносит в лучшем случае 16% годовых. Вместе с этим консервативные инструменты, такие как депозиты, из-за инфляции не обеспечивают даже сохранение средств.  На этом фоне инвесторы со средним и крупным капиталом активно ищут новые инструменты, которые могли бы приносить стабильную высокую доходность при разумных и контролируемых рисках. Одним из таких инструментов стали прямые инвестиции в МСБ-компании. Еще недавно это направление — давно и хорошо развитое на Западе — считалось (и отчасти справедливо) чрезмерно рискованным, труднодоступным для частных инвесторов и не подходящим для специфики российского рынка. Дать этому инструменту настоящий старт в России, сделать его доступным широкому кругу и найти механизмы управления сопутствующими рисками смогла инвестиционная компания IMPACT Capital, основанная в 2019 году лауреатом конкурса «Молодой предприниматель России» Валерием Золотухиным.  Мы попросили у представителей компании IMPACT Capital отзывы о новом подходе к инвестициям в МСБ, рисках и выгодах, которые приносит инвесторам данный инструмент.  По их словам, частные инвестиции в молодые частные компании приносят доходность от 20-35% годовых до сотен и даже тысяч процентов при выходе портфельного проекта на IPO. Объектом таких инвестиций выступают молодые предприятия с инновационным, выдающимся продуктом, которые уже миновали стадию стартапа и находятся на раунде А. Риски на этом этапе значительно ниже венчурных, а порог входа сравнительно более доступный, чем на стадии pre-IPO.  До IMPACT Capital частным инвесторам было затруднительно инвестировать в МСБ напрямую, без посредничества инвестиционных фондов, так как не существует единой площадки для поиска таких компаний, их анализ требует специфических компетенций. Кроме того, не всегда возможно инвестировать «с улицы» в даже самый перспективный бизнес.  IMPACT Capital сосредоточились на поиске и фундаментальном анализе МСБ-компаний — этим занимается как центральное московское подразделение, так и развитая сеть региональных и международных партнеров. Из тысячи проанализированных компаний в портфель IMPACT Capital в среднем попадает только одна. Чаще всего это настоящие самородки, которые обладают не только ноухау, но потенциалом работы на мировом рынке. Например, компания IMPACT Capital инвестировала в такие проекты, как Dodo Pizza, Technored и Omnic, которые сегодня известны далеко за пределами России.  Компания IMPACT Capital инвестирует в перспективные МСБ-предприятия сама и помогает войти в них частным инвесторам через механизм инвестиционных синдикатов. Инвестор сохраняет возможность действовать гибко и независимо, может принимать участие в работе портфельной компании и увеличивать доходность своей доли за счет собственных знаний и компетенций. Сам IMPACT Capital в данной модели выступает в роли лид-инвестора, обеспечивая юридическое и стратегическое сопровождение сделок, тем самым снижая риски всех вовлеченных сторон. На сегодняшний день прямые инвестиции в частные компании с помощью IMPACT Capital совершили уже более 140 инвесторов. Их отзывы об IMPACT Capital и предложенной ею инвестиционной модели положительные. По оценке участников инвестиционных синдикатов, новую модель прямых инвестиций в МСБ можно назвать революцией на рынке инвестиционных продуктов, которая открывает частным инвесторам доступ к прежде закрытому и элитарному рынку Private Equity.  Ознакомиться с условиями управления активами, получить сведения о лице, осуществляющем управление активами, и иную информацию можно на сайте https://impact-capital.com, по телефону +7 (495)278-08-88 или в офисе по адресу — ул.

"Complex business. The head of the ""New Dynamo"" project - about future prospects",https://aif.ru/sport/football/slozhnyy_biznes_glava_proekta_novoe_dinamo_o_dalneyshih_perspektivah,"
21.12.2021 19:07 ",2022-07-21,"Московское «Динамо» неоднократно становилось объектом внимания любителей футбола, а его поклонники и вовсе знают о клубе все. Вместе им пришлось пережить немало испытаний, в том числе и вылет клуба из высшего дивизиона. Сейчас же видеть клуб на второй строчке турнирной таблицы РПЛ, да еще и в статусе едва ли не единственного легитимного преследователя признанного гегемона внутреннего первенства, санкт-петербургского «Зенита», достаточно непривычно. Своим мнением о дальнейших перспективах в интервью с «Интерфаксом» поделился глава проекта под условным названием «Новое Динамо», председатель совета директоров принадлежащего ВТБ клуба, а также первый зампред банка Юрий Соловьев. Отвечая на вопрос: какую задачу ставят перед собой и руководство клуба, и сами игроки, Юрий Соловьев ответил следующее. «Когда мы взяли на себя управление клубом два с половиной года назад, большое внимание уделили стратегии, чтобы найти свою собственную философию и точнее передать дух команды. „Динамо“ — это сила в движении, сила в единстве. Это должно было найти отражение на поле. Мы несем ответственность за развитие клуба, для нас это большая честь. Мы действуем очень последовательно, осторожно, но уверенно. Мы нацелены на долгосрочное развитие команды, ее игры. Развитие — это, наверное, ключевое слово. И за эти 2,5 года мы показали, что команда развивается по всем направлениям», — отметил Юрий Соловьев. Он также отметил, что и тренерский, и спортивный штабы также разделяют данную философию. Они также отмечали, что в числе их приоритетов обеспечение развитие игроков, совершенствование навыков футболистов, проведение работы с молодыми талантами. Следствием такой работы станут результаты команды. И тот факт, что сейчас клуб борется за первое место — отлично и уже превосходит запланированные результаты. Но при этом работает как отличная мотивация. «Что мы ждем весной от клуба, в том числе и я? Качественного привлекательного футбола, самоотдачи в каждом матче, желания побеждать, бороться. У нас тут общее видение с главным тренером, со спортивным штабом. Текущая стратегия клуба — это выходить и показывать максимум в каждом матче. Наша цель не изменилась — выйти в еврокубки и достойно выступить на европейской арене», — сказал Юрий Соловьев. Руководитель проекта отметил, что стратегия клуба расписана по большому количеству направлений. Каждая команда управленцев имеет свои четкие КПЭ. Эти установки в полной мере отражают тот футбол и ту философию, которую хотелось бы видеть. «Вертикальный футбол, интенсивный, зрелищный, красивый, нацеленный на удары по воротам. И так мы подходим ко всему, от бренда до технологической трансформации клуба. Это важно понимать, поскольку очень много фундаментальных процессов нам пришлось перезапустить», — подчеркнул Юрий Соловьев. В 2023 году клуб будет праздновать солидный юбилей — 100 лет с момента основания. Естественно, и футболисты, и их тренерские штабы, а также их спонсоры стремятся отметить такой «день рождения» яркой победой. «2023 год — год столетия клуба, особенный момент. Выиграть титул в год столетия, да просто выиграть титул — для нас это мечта. Но все же самое важное в том, что мы нацелены на долгосрочное развитие клуба, а не на краткосрочные результаты. Нам важно, чтобы „Динамо“ по праву занимало лидирующие позиции, боролось за призовые места регулярно, каждый сезон. А разогнаться, добиться цели, а потом уйти в небытие — это неинтересно», — объясняет Юрий Соловьев. Ни у кого не должно возникать сомнений, что все причастные к клубу сделают все, чтобы его выступление было достойным. Пришлось долго жить не победами, а воспоминаниями о них, трофеями, которые видели отцы и деды. «Мы стремимся к тому, чтобы эту ситуацию изменить. Болельщики своей преданностью и верой в команду на фоне длинной полосы неудач точно заслужили такой праздник. Наша цель — вернуть „Динамо“ титулы и статус топ-клуба. Мы в начале новой главы в истории клуба, и мы хотим сделать ее очень яркой», — рассказывает Юрий Соловьев. Как нередко отмечалось, долгое время проблемой клуба было отсутствие четкой вертикали управления. То есть создалась ситуация, когда решения вроде бы принимались, но при этом за последствия, особенно если это были негативные варианты, ответственность брать на себя никто не хотел. И даже было неясно, к кому адресовать претензии. Сейчас ситуация меняется. Было решено, что нужно задействовать лучшие управленческие ресурсы и заняться проектом серьезно. «Мы действительно выделили значительные ресурсы, прежде всего человеческие. Мы, как группа, являемся инвесторами в огромное количество разных видов бизнеса, в разных секторах, в разных странах. У нас накоплен колоссальный управленческий опыт и свое видение того, как должен работать бизнес. Соответственно, мы подошли к управлению клубом с тем же лекалом. Весь свой 30-летний опыт работы в финансовой сфере я применил и к „Динамо“. И кроме меня еще очень много людей в этом процессе участвует», — рассказывает Юрий Соловьев. Сейчас работает схема с советом директоров, где проходят обсуждение и получают одобрение все стратегические вопросы по всем направлениям развития, в том числе и вопросы по трансферам. Здесь же определяются и стратегии разного плана — от спортивной до финансовой. Есть при совете и комитеты, прорабатывающие задачи в рамках своего направления. Кроме того, как говорит Юрий Соловьев, есть и консультационный совет, в который привлечены ветераны футбольного клуба, а также представители общественности, бизнеса и болельщиков. Далее в иерархии управления клуба присутствует правление, есть генеральный директор, отвечающий за свой круг вопросов. «Сейчас очень четко понятно, кто за что отвечает. Футбол оказался более сложным бизнесом, чем, наверное, большинство других, с которыми мы работаем. Здесь совсем нет мелочей, абсолютно, важно буквально все — от риск-менеджмента при подписании контрактов с футболистами и работниками клуба до того, какая именно вода в кулерах. Я периодически встречаюсь с командой. На первой встрече 10-15 минут были посвящены обсуждению качества воды, которую пьют футболисты», — говорит Юрий Соловьев. Вся вертикаль управления сегодня вкладывает в развитие клуба и финансовые средства, и опыт, а еще и свою душу. Ведь футбол сравним с наукой, искусством, а также это и тяжелая работа, и определенный элемент удачи. Важный вопрос в такой масштабной работе — время. Ведь приходится сочетать развитие клуба с основной работой. «Пришлось выделять на это помимо рабочего больше личного времени — на уик-эндах, по ночам и в отпусках. Было время, когда приходилось собирать менеджмент клуба по несколько раз в неделю, поскольку мы тогда только начали выстраивать все процессы. Я очень много времени посвятил лично — так же, как члены совета директоров и правления — поиску персонала, управленческой команды. Футболистов это тоже касается», — отмечает Юрий Соловьев. Но это важные затраты, так как, по мнению руководителя проекта «новое Динамо», то время, которое уделяется какому-то вопросу, обратно пропорционально уровню доверия или тому, как со своей работой справляются и целые подразделения, и отдельный человек. В фокусе внимания продолжают оставаться стратегические вопросы — Юрий Соколов тщательно за ними следит. «Для меня люди — приоритет номер один, и пока я буду занимать эту должность, я всегда буду уделять время главному — команде в широком смысле слова. Для меня это очень важный проект. Я не получаю за него какую-то финансовую компенсацию, для меня — это вопрос и чести, и ответственности», — говори он. После игр на домашнем поле руководитель клубного проекта старается зайти к игрокам — это помогает оценить микроклимат внутри команды, побыть с игроками как в минуты радости, так и огорчений. Активная работа не могла остаться незамеченной. Так, например, в три трансферных окна, которые оказались очень важными, прошло ощутимое обновление коллектива, сменились не только футболисты, но и два тренерских штаба. И это были важные стадии становления и развития всего проекта. «Это были важные стадии становления и развития всего проекта. Результаты клуба, наверное, говорят сами за себя, команда очевидно боеспособна, оценка ее стоимости увеличивается. С мая 2019 года, когда „Динамо“ возглавила новая управленческая команда, суммарная трансферная стоимость игроков клуба выросла с 33 млн евро до 82,4 млн евро по данным Transfermarkt», — подчеркнул Юрий Соловьев. «Привезти качественного футболиста за вменяемые деньги в Россию достаточно сложно. И мы видели примеры даже за эти 2-3 года, когда приезжают достаточно дорогие игроки и не могут адаптироваться в нашем чемпионате. Это не в одной команде происходит, а практически у всех лидеров российского чемпионата эти истории периодически повторяются. Сложно привезти не только хорошего игрока, но и человека, который встроится в коллектив и сможет себя реализовать в нашем чемпионате. Но есть примеры, и очень позитивные, футболистов, которые приезжают и работают. Про другие клубы не буду говорить, но у нас абсолютное большинство легионеров команды очень хорошо прогрессирует сегодня», — отмечает глава проекта. Конечно же, важная тема IPO в футболе. «Продать какой-то клуб болельщикам в российских бизнес-реалиях, с тем, как работает бизнес-модель российских клубов в настоящий момент, — без титульного спонсора, который фактически несет на себе финансовую нагрузку существования клуба, — наверное, невозможно. Поэтому нужно быть готовым много вкладывать в клуб для того, чтобы выбранная модель, при условии поддержки экономики сектора в целом, вывела клуб в какой-то положительный результат», — говорит Юрий Соловьев. Он также апеллирует к европейскому опыту. Где есть несколько десятков торгуемых клубов и при этом по результатам последних 3-4 лет большая часть и них убыточна. "" Если посмотреть на базу инвеcторов футбольных клубов, то, как правило, эти клубы входят в индексы бирж, на которых они торгуются, это то, что называется small caps, то есть компании невысокой капитализации, часть их free float покупается индексными фондами, вынужденных приобретать структуру индекса. Остальная часть — частные инвесторы, которые являются болельщиками клуба. У них не вполне экономическая мотивация владения этими акциями. Этот элемент эмоциональности в приобретении акций футбольного клуба совершенно точно может найти себя и в российской действительности, даже в том случае, если сама экономическая бизнес-модель клуба или сектора в целом убыточна«, — поясняет Юрий Соловьев. И добавляет, что для выхода на серьезный уровень клуб должен обзавестись большим числом болельщиков и относительно вменяемой ценой. Но не стоит сбрасывать со счетов и клубный патриотизм. Как говорит Юрий Соловьев, этот параметр можно считать важным элементом социальной стоимости клуба. «Несколько раз на нас выходили европейские клубы и инвесторы в футбольные клубы, мы обсуждали различные модели кооперации, в том числе и кросс-акционирования. Мы пока не нашли правильную форму, которая отвечала бы интересам прежде всего футбольного клуба „Динамо“. Мы сторонники открытой экоплатформы, экосистемы в целом в группе ВТБ, но для нас важно не просто чье-то участие, нам важно, чтобы люди привносили дополнительную ценность, опыт, умные деньги, если речь о них. Поэтому пока в этом контексте мы партнеров не нашли», — говорит Юрий Соловьев.  


Футбол детям. В городах России открылись филиалы академии «Динамо»
Подробнее 



 Единственный путь развития академии «Динамо», по мнению Юрия Соловьева, — сделать ее независимой от различных негативных факторов в экономике. И лучше всего выбрать для нее источником финансирования эндаумент. Тем более, что банк является аьбсолютным лидером в управлении целевыми капиталами — имеется больше 70 эндаумент-фондов под управлением. В 2020 году был создан такой фонд для «Динамо», и сейчас в нем насчитывается 4,3 млрд рублей, из которых 4 млрд — целевой капитал, остальное относится к инвестиционному. «В 2022 году мы планируем активизировать работу по фандрайзингу, будем активно рассказать болельщикам и всем, кто неравнодушен к футболу, что пожертвования в эндаумент-фонд — уникальная возможность для личного участия в формировании будущего футбола в нашей стране. По нашим расчетам, в течение ближайших четырех-пяти лет целевой капитал эндаумента выйдет на тот уровень, который позволит следующее десятилетие полностью финансировать затраты на развитие нашего детско-юношеского футбола. Эндаумент предполагает, что целевой капитал не расходуется, инвестируется, а инвестиционный доход направляется на финансирование академии. Инвестиционная стратегия фонда достаточно консервативная: сейчас 20% инвестируются в акции, 80% — в облигации», — подчеркнул Юрий Соловьев. «Мы считаем это краеугольным камнем для дальнейшего развития футбольного клуба в целом. Я оценил бы работу академии за последнее десятилетие положительно. Яркие дебюты последнего времени — это Константин Тюкавин, Арсен Захарян, Ярослав Гладышев, Александр Кутицкий, Владислав Галкин. Можно вспомнить еще очень много фамилий, в основном составе „Динамо“ сегодня 11 выпускников нашей академии, от капитана Антона Шунина и до очень молодых футболистов. Также ряд ярких футболистов из динамовской академии играют в других клубах, в том числе, и ведущих клубах РПЛ», — отметил Юрий Соловьев. Он также заявил, что крайне важно продолжать эти традиции, увеличивать число ярких талантов. Уже было открыто 4 региональных центра, в планах в следующем году открыть еще два. Также в начале года необходимо приступить к строительству центральной академии, которой у клуба долгое время не было. Тем более, что место уже найдено. «Надеемся построить одну из лучших академий страны по абсолютно топовым европейским стандартам. Поэтому если все получится, как мы планируем, в 2024 году у „Динамо“ должна быть новая академия для мальчишек и девчонок в Москве», — поделился планами руководитель проекта. Она должна расположиться на берегу Москва-реки по северо-западному направлению. По франшизе сейчас работают 26 спортивных школ, а хочется, чтобы их было 100. На данный момент в таких школах занимаются 1200 детей. И несколько молодых футболистов из первой школы «Динамо» в Махачкале уже были привлечены в Москву. «Подход и философия игры будет одна, начиная от основной команды до самых юных возрастов, „Динамо“ готовит ребят по специализированным методикам, чтобы выпускники спортивных школ, те, кто доучится и проявит себя, соответствовали критериям игры в основной команде. Клуб полностью переводит процесс подготовки на технологические рельсы. В прошлом году „Динамо“ первым в России поставил на тренировочном поле академии умные камеры со встроенным искусственным интеллектом и технологией отслеживания мяча и спортивных событий, происходящих на поле, получаемые видео становятся частью процесса подготовки аналитического досье воспитанника. Только в этом году тысячи тренировок были проведены с видеонаблюдением. Надеюсь, в перспективе, как делают большие клубы, „Динамо“ будет анализировать ДНК маленьких футболистов, чтобы более эффективно строить тренировочный процесс», — делится планами Юрий Соловьев. Сегодня технологии в футболе и биотехнологии уже на другом уровне. У клуба есть лаборатория, работающая с основной командой, а в дальнейшем планируется использовать их в отношении более юных возрастов. Клуб старается подходить как к тренировкам, так и учебному процессу максимально научно. Также к работе подключили и единую цифровую систему — в ней собрана вся информация по игрокам. Такая мера позволит эффективно управлять командой, планировать тренировки, отслеживать физическое состояние игроков, медицинские назначения, анализировать показатели игры. Туда подключены и команды академии. «Собирается статистика по молодым игрокам с их первых шагов в спорте. С годами и увеличением количества выпускников академии, прошедших через анализ искусственного интеллекта, мы будем вырабатывать и получать определенные алгоритмы как подготовки, так и понимания спортивного потенциала развития футболистов. Мы очень жадно ищем технологии по всему миру, у нас работают международные консультанты, которые сотрудничают с топовыми клубами. Мы стараемся сделать из „Динамо“ цифровой клуб», — рассказывает Юрий Соловьев. Он также отмечает, что нужно создавать максимально благоприятные условия для развития игроков, чтобы им хотелось оставаться в клубе, было куда расти и показывать прогресс. Такой подход находит поддержку и у тренерского и спортивного штабов. Тренеры дают молодым ребятам все возможности и работают над развитием их качеств. Причем клуб не гонится за покупками игроков, стараясь уделять внимание своим — уже было несколько отказов от приобретения игроков в пользу воспитания своих ребят. «На мой взгляд, у большинства наших ребят очень правильные приоритеты, правильное окружение, их поддерживают семьи, что очень важно в период становления. Мы надеемся дальше работать и с ними, и с их агентами, и с их семьями, чтобы дать им возможность дальнейшего прогресса. И если дальнейший прогресс будет вне стен „Динамо“, мы будем этому содействовать», — отметил Юрий Соловьев. «На данный момент отчетность клуба и финансовые планы на ближайшие годы полностью соответствуют всем критериям финансового fair play. Я этому лично уделял очень большое внимание, это был важный пункт в моем списке задач. Мы каждый год получаем лицензию, позволяющую принимать участие в еврокубках, находимся в постоянном рабочем контакте с УЕФА по этому вопросу», — рассказывает Юрий Соловьев. Был определен объем финансов на год, который пока увеличивать не планируется При этом клуб четко вписывается в те же самые деньги. А стоимость бренда и клуба растет. «Коммерческая стратегия клуба подразумевает рост выручки от мерчендайзинга в 2,5 раза по итогам этого сезона по сравнению с сезоном 2020/2021, а спонсорства — в 1,5 раза. Matchday revenue тоже планируются к увеличению», — отмечает руководитель проекта. Планируется рационализировать использование стадиона в пользу его большей прибыльности. Есть рост интереса со стороны спонсоров, связанный с ростом аудитории клуба и улучшением его спортивного результата. Работа с агентами не может оставаться в футбольной теме вне внимания. «Агенты — это часть футбольной реальности. „Динамо“ работает по своим клубным стандартам, мне кажется, агентское сообщество это уже четко понимает. Клуб не делит агентов на своих и чужих, главный фокус — это развитие футболистов, улучшение их профессиональных качеств, предоставление им платформы для дальнейшего развития карьеры», — уточняет Юрий Соловьев. Клуб «Динамо» не рассматривает агентов в качестве собственников футболистов. Прежде всего работа строится как с представителями игрока и внимательно отслеживается такой пункт, как интересы игрока. «Важный элемент в футбольном бизнесе — прозрачность. Не редки случаи, когда агенты пытаются манипулировать, искажают информацию, которая идет от руководства клуба. Клуб в свою очередь всегда настаивает на прозрачности, долгосрочности и взаимовыгодности отношений», — говорит Юрий Соловьев. При этом клуб старается иметь партнерские отношения с агентами, пытается найти общую финансовую цель. Сейчас же руководство клуба и проекта под условным названием «новое Динамо» настроено позитивно, развитие продолжается. Юрий Соловьев надеется, что 2022 станет для «Динамо» годом побед, а имя клуб в самом хорошем смысле может прогреметь в российском футболе. "

Formation of a new order. Eco-responsibility of the Russian music industry,https://aif.ru/society/ecology/formirovanie_novogo_uklada_ekootvetstvennost_muzykalnoy_industrii_rossii,"
06.09.2021 17:41 ",2022-07-21,"В ближайшее время «Русская Медиагруппа» объединится с «Российским экологическим оператором», чтобы призвать представителей медиа и музыкальной индустрии популяризировать идеи рационального использования природных ресурсов, совместно участвовать в природоохранных и волонтёрских акциях. Ключевым документом нового союза стало «зелёное соглашение», подписанное в рамках ВЭФ-2021. По задумке разработчиков документа, главная цель «зелёного соглашения» — увеличение доли населения Российской Федерации, осуществляющего раздельный сбор отходов, и формирование экологической культуры в обществе. О том, как изменилась музыкальная индустрия в России из-за пандемии, как в компании реализуется стратегия устойчивого развития, почему важно сотрудничество медиа и экологов, а также какие эфирные и неэфирные проекты ждут слушателей в новом сезоне, АиФ.ru рассказал управляющий директор «Русской Медиагруппы» Дмитрий Медников. — Со 2 по 4 сентября во Владивостоке прошел Восточный экономический форум, в котором ваш холдинг принимал участие. Какие темы были затронуты на площадке ВЭФ? — Мы подписали соглашение с «Росконгрессом» о целом наборе совместных проектов. Наша задача состоит в том, чтобы на большую международную площадку (сейчас ПМЭФ и ВЭФ — одни из крупнейших в мире по количеству участников и по капитализации этих участников) полноценно вывести российскую музыкальную индустрию.  На Дальнем Востоке у российских соседей очень много примеров роста стоимости музыкальных брендов. Это и корейский, и китайский рынок, где прошли феноменальные IPO таких брендов. Доходы этой индустрии тоже растут опережающими темпами по отношению ко всей экономике. Это яркие примеры, которые понятны инвесторам, связанным именно с инвестициями в музыкальные бренды. Они достаточно устойчивы, долго работают и для инвесторов дают хорошую капитализацию.  На ВЭФ к нам присоединились Вячеслав Бутусов и Дима Билан, звезды российской музыки. Участие в таком крупном экономическом событии — лучший повод продемонстрировать, что у музыки появляется новая стоимость и новая капитализация. Для нас было также важно заявить об успешном развитии, создании бизнеса через ценностную повестку.  — Как вы оцениваете последствия пандемии COVID-19 для музыкальной индустрии? — Пандемия критически повлияла на музыкальную индустрию. Вся офлайновая часть индустрии испытывает драматические проблемы. Это может привести к исчезновению ряда игроков, сильному перепрофилированию рынка, изменению подходов. Другой вопрос, что уменьшение офлайновой части привело к увеличению внимания к онлайновой, к стримингам, к музыкальным радиостанциям, к самим артистам в цифровой среде. При этом мы видим, что интерес к офлайновой музыке возрастает. Люди не просто не отвыкают, они хотят больше живых событий, которых в силу понятных обстоятельств до сих пор немного. Мировой опыт показывает, что креативная индустрия все больше и больше лидирует в формировании стоимости, в доходности, в капитализации. Все в равной степени растут, осуществляют экспансию на новые рынки. Появляются новые способы потребления музыкального контента. Благодаря беспроводным наушникам люди все больше и больше слушают звук. Многие практически не расстаются с наушниками в течение дня. По 10 часов в сутки они используют их для того, чтобы что-то слушать либо разговаривать. Существенная часть с удовольствием уделяет время прослушиванию музыки. И, по сути, это время расцвета потребления музыки можно сравнить с эпохой появления радио.  Развлекательная индустрия, в том числе музыкальная, не находилась в деловой коммуникации в России. Это была абсолютно отдельная сфера. Нет правил игры, нет моделей, нет собственно специалистов, инвесторов. Но сейчас возникло понимание того, что это интересно и необходимо.  — Каков личный опыт холдинга? Как удалось пережить кризисный период и как дела обстоят на сегодняшний день? — Год был тяжелый. Очевидно, что все находились в некотором непонимании, как рекламодатели, так и медиакомпании. Был год большого падения. Все, кто пережил, сокращали расходы и максимально оптимизировали собственную деятельность. В этом году мы видим, что рынок сильно вырос. Показатели «Русской Медиагруппы» уже опередили показатели 2019 года. Рынок цифрового аудио в ближайшие годы будет расти на десятки, а то и сотни процентов в год.  Радио в России традиционно недооценено, несмотря на то, что радийная реклама — один из самых эффективных способов продвижения. Радио сейчас находится по эффективности на первом-втором месте. Другой вопрос, что «цифра» дает более быструю, более точную статистику. Но, когда радийный охват и радийная эффективность совмещаются с цифровой статистикой через радио, подкасты и плейлисты, возникает уникальный сервис, который позволяет достаточно качественно оценивать поведенческие модели аудитории, таргетировать рекламу и осуществлять массовые рекламные кампании очень оперативно. Восстановиться в полном объеме музыкальной индустрии, безусловно, поможет отмена ограничений. — Каким образом в холдинге реализуется стратегия устойчивого развития? — Существенный компонент устойчивой повестки развития бизнеса — это экологическая повестка. Сейчас все более значимым становится стандарт ESG, и очевидным образом музыкальные лидеры точно так же формируют это общественное мнение на бытовом уровне и определенную культуру поведения. И мы как раз будем обсуждать новый уклад бизнес-жизни и возможности взаимодействия культуры и бизнеса в этом новом укладе. Существенной частью этого является экологическая повестка в разных вариантах (индустриальная, природоохранная, охрана животных, переработка мусора и т. д.) У нас цели устойчивого развития давно начали воплощаться в жизнь. «Русская Медиагруппа» — холдинг медийный, он отличается достаточно низкими нагрузками на окружающую среду. Но исторически он принимает участие в проектах, направленных на социальное развитие, по сути, инвестируя свои рекламные возможности в социальные проекты. Это и волонтерские проекты, и природоохранные, и образовательные.  До поры до времени это не было сформулировано как полноценная стратегия устойчивого развития. В стандарты устойчивого развития бизнес приходит последний год. В этом смысле активность была, сейчас она формируется в понятную длинную дорожную карту. Дорожную карту не просто внутреннюю, а открытую для внешних партнеров. Именно поэтому на ВЭФ-2021 мы вышли к нашим партнерам с «зеленой инициативой». Кстати, первыми к ней присоединились российские звезды, такие как Вячеслав Бутусов, Дима Билан, Nyusha, Согдиана, Юля Савичева, Тимур Родригез, Юлианна Караулова. Мы очень рассчитываем на то, что возникнут достаточно тесные системные отношения между компаниями, лидерами мнений, управляющими общественным мнением в области устойчивой повестки. Для нас важно вырабатывать новые нормы и способы распространения, по сути, новой культуры. Экологической. Где, условно, наша задача — это распространение, а задача центров компетенции и экологов, крупных корпораций — эту компетенцию формулировать.

Новые заповедники и заказники. Как в России сохраняют экологию



— Почему возникло решение о сотрудничестве с «Российским экологическим оператором»? — Мы не являемся экологами, профессионалами в этой области. Эти компетенции сконцентрированы либо у ученых, специалистов, либо у крупных промышленных холдингов, которые инвестируют в это много лет, а мы постепенно с рядом партнеров будем подписывать соответствующие соглашения.  Одно из соглашений, которые мы подписали на ВЭФ-2021, — это как раз соглашение с «Российским экологическим оператором» о взаимном обогащении друг друга. Мы — со стороны эфирных и неэфирных возможностей, а коллеги — с точки зрения компетенций. Именно РЭО сегодня выступает центром экологической компетенции в коммуникации между бизнесом, медиа и обществом. И наша общая задача состоит в популяризации идей и принципов рационального использования природных ресурсов, бережного отношения к природе и формировании экологической культуры. В принципе, уважающая себя компания (что в России, что в мире) не сможет работать вне экологической повестки. Повестка сохранения окружающей среды в ее многообразии будет все более значимой.  И до тех пор, пока не появится четкого и внятного ответа на вопрос о том, сумеем ли мы все вместе избежать климатической катастрофы в ближайшие десятилетия, эта повестка будет становиться все более значимой. Сейчас очень много дискуссий климатологов. Кто-то говорит о том, что изменения уже невозможно повернуть назад, они носят необратимый характер. Кто-то говорит о том, что та деятельность, которая сейчас ведется, позволит через 30 лет начать обратный процесс. Все равно все, как я понимаю, сходятся в том, что глобальное потепление имеет инерционный характер. И понятно, что вопрос изменения — это вопрос не нескольких юридических лиц, это вопрос нового уклада. И мы как участники процесса и рынка понимаем существенную ответственность и очень хотим быть частью процесса формирования правильного экологического поведения человека. Экологичность поведения — это не только вопрос окружающей среды, это и вопрос жизни в больших городах, и вопрос общения с соседями, с друзьями. Это в какой-то степени новый экономический уклад. В свое время появился индустриальный уклад. До этого момента люди переходили из кочевого состояния в состояние оседлости. Сейчас люди переходят из состояния безответственности в состояние экологической ответственности. И мы, очевидно, чувствуем себя частью этого процесса, хотим в нем активно участвовать и приносить пользу.  — Какие эфирные продукты и внеэфирные мероприятия ждут зрителей и слушателей? — Мы запустим несколько новых проектов. К примеру, мы войдем в кинопрокат. С октября зрители в кинотеатрах смогут увидеть лучшие концерты топовых групп. «Максимальный уикенд» пройдет при поддержке радио MAXIMUM. Потом посмотрим, стоит ли этот опыт распространить шире. Очень хочется надеяться, что это поможет удовлетворить запрос на живую музыку. Аудиовозможности кинотеатров и зрелищность, конечно, живой концерт полностью не заменят, но это лучше, чем концерт на экране телефона. Это создаст существенный эффект присутствия. И для нас как медийного холдинга, и для кинотеатров это новый контент. Причем новый контент топового мирового уровня. Кроме того, 1 сентября у нас стартовал всероссийский «Музыкальный кастинг» исполнителей. Сначала кастинг пройдёт онлайн, потом в очном формате художественный совет из программных директоров радиостанций «Русской Медиагруппы» и экспертов музыкальной индустрии выберет самых талантливых и перспективных, их мы проинвестируем.

The Cabinet of Ministers has prepared a new package of support for small and medium-sized businesses,https://aif.ru/politics/russia/kabmin_podgotovil_novyy_paket_podderzhki_malogo_i_srednego_biznesa,"
25.05.2021 04:35 ",2022-07-21,"The government has formed an additional support package for small and medium-sized businesses, which Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed to prepare, Izvestia writes, citing three sources close to the Cabinet. According to the interlocutors, the support pool included the zeroing of VAT for restaurateurs and hoteliers, as well as an increase from 15% to 20% of the mandatory quota for purchases from SMEs for state customers and from 20% to 30% for state-owned companies. In addition, the new support package is planned to include the provision of capital in the amount of 100,000 rubles in the form of certificates for start-up entrepreneurs to start their own business and support in bringing the business to an IPO. During the conversation with correspondents of the publication, the managing director of the NKR rating agency Dmitry Orekhov noted that the direct cost of an additional package of measures for the budget is not too high, since a significant part of the instruments does not require financing. In his opinion, about 15 billion rubles may be required from the government for these purposes. Recall that earlier, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin also instructed the Ministry of Industry and Trade to prepare proposals for additional support for import substitution by July 15."

Who is Peloton’s co-founder and former CEO John Foley?,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14688053/peloton-bike-founder-ceo-john-foley-net-worth-billionaire/,9 Feb 2022,2022-07-21,"JOHN Foley founded Peloton out of a need for fitting exercise into a busy work-life schedule.   The company skyrocketed throughout the pandemic, before facing a dramatic stock crash in November 2021. John Foley is the founder and former CEO of Peloton. Before he started his business venture, he was formerly the e-commerce president at Barnes & Noble. Foley also worked at Mars Inc. before founding Peloton and earned his bachelor's degree in science and industrial engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1994. In 2001, he earned an MBA from Harvard Business School. Throughout 2020 and much of 2021, Foley was worth around $1.5billion and listed on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. However, on November 4, 2021, Peloton announced a hiring freeze in light of decreased demand for its product, and the company saw shares plummet in response. As of January 2022, Foley's net worth dropped from $850million in November 2021 to $350million, according to Business Insider. The largest trade he's ever made was selling 100,000 units of Peloton Interactive Inc stock on 15 March 2021 worth more than $11,067,000.  Peloton was founded in 2013 after Foley, a cycling enthusiast, raised $307,000 to get his in-home exercise startup off the ground. He co-founded Peloton alongside Graham Stanton, Hisao Kushi, Yony Feng, and Tom Cortese. Peloton now has more than 60,000 riders and the number continues to increase as the company grows. Foley is married to fellow self-described fitness addict Jill Foley and the two reside in New York City. Peloton rose out of a need to make workouts convenient for busy people who want to stay fit.  Attending instructor-led fitness classes became difficult for the pair after they started their family. Foley thought that fitness could be easier if people could have instructor-led fitness training streamed to their homes. This led to Jill Foley running Peloton's apparel division.  The company sells branded exercise apparel in its 15 showrooms and online. John Foley has been replaced as CEO of Peloton by the former chief financial officer of Spotify and Netflix, Barry McCarthy. Along with the change in leadership, Peloton Interactive Inc. is also laying off 2,800 employees after a drop in demand led the once-hot cycling company's stock price to fall. “Barry is an incredible leader who has held senior executive roles at Spotify and Netflix and is a longtime advisor and board member at public and private technology companies,” said Foley in an open letter.  “This appointment is the culmination of a months-long succession plan that I’ve been working on with our Board of Directors, and we are thrilled to have found in Barry the perfect leader for the next chapter of Peloton.  ""I look forward to working with him and invite you to welcome him with open arms.” The change came after Peloton's stocks plummeted, resulting in what McCarthy says is a need to implement a ""succession plan."" Part of McCarthy's plan is to cut back on warehouses nationwide, ultimately saving the company more than $800million annually. The Wall Street Journal also reported that McCarthy will be laying off about 2,800 employees, equating to a roughly 20% cutback in the workforce. ""This restructuring program is the result of diligent planning to address key areas of the business and realign our operations so that we can execute against our growth opportunity with efficiency and discipline,"" Peloton commented in a press release. McCarthy claims the changes are a result of ""missteps"" the company made and its rapid growth set it behind financially. ""I love Peloton,"" McCarthy said, adding ""We own this.,"" referring to the company's alleged errors.  ""I own this,"" he said. ""And we're holding ourselves accountable.""
