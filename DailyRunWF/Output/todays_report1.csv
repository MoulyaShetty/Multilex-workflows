Kenya: No offers in two years as NSE suffers IPOs drought,https://www.african-markets.com/en/stock-markets/nse/kenya-no-offers-in-two-years-as-nse-suffers-ipos-drought," March 07, 2018 10:48 PM",2022-10-13 03:44:33.578391,"Kenya capital markets lagged behind peers in Africa in Initial Public Offers (IPOs) and other secondary listings in the last five years, a new report shows.
 
According to the 2017 Africa Capital Markets Watch by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) had no IPOs raised in either 2016 or 2017.
 
In the last five years, the NSE has only been able to raise Sh4.2 billion ($42 million) through two IPOs offered in 2014 and 2015 raising Sh700 million and Sh3.5 billion respectively.
 
“There were also no IPO activity in 2017 in Ghana compared to 2016, which saw $102 million raised on the Ghana Stock Exchange.

This year, the Nairobi Securities Exchange and Nigeria Stock Exchange both extended their IPO drought, with no new IPO capital raised in either 2016 or 2017,” the report said.
 
In contrast, elsewhere on the continent, 2017 saw some significant increases in IPO value on exchanges in Namibia, Rwanda and Tanzania compared to 2016.
 
This increased activity can be attributed to a combination of continued efforts by governments to either privatise stakes in state-owned entities or encourage local companies to list on domestic exchanges to build local market participation, and in certain situations, regulatory requirements compelling certain companies in certain sectors to list.
 
Over a five-year period, the vast majority of Further Offer (FO) activity (which include rights issues and second public offering) took place in South Africa, representing 65 per cent and 86 per cent of total FO volume and value, respectively.
 
Kenyan FO activity stalled in 2017 with no further offers on the NSE, potentially attributable to the tense environment that developed subsequent to elections held during the year.
 
During the period, Kenya was only able to raise a total of Sh31.8 billion from five offers, with two raising Sh4.6 billion in 2014, and three raising Sh27.2 billion in 2016.
But in 2016. KenGen FO was among the top 10 FOs of that year after raising Sh26.2 billion.

Millions have already been raised in this historic Initial Product Offering (IPO), with people across Namibia showing incredible appetite to invest in Letshego Namibia shares.
 
Letshego Namibia’s story is about empowerment, via the solutions it provides, and now via Ekwafo Letu, as it offers 20 percent of the company’s shares for sale to the Namibian public.
 
Letshego believes that to be totally financially inclusive, it should offer Namibians the opportunity to be part of its growth. As Letshego grows, so shall ordinary Namibians’ wealth.
 
Letshego Namibia CEO, Ester Kali: “This is a platform for financial inclusion, and our objective from the onset was to ensure maximum citizen participation in this great opportunity for empowerment.

“This is with a particular focus on previously disadvantaged Namibians. The reception by Namibians has been strong, and we look forward to welcoming a great many new shareholders in this proudly Namibian business. This is our time. This is Ekwafo Letu.”
 
The opportunity for Namibians to buy shares is limited – the last day they can submit their offers to purchase Letshego Namibia shares is Friday, September 22.
 
The total value of the shares offered to the public is about N$470 million. When Kali first announced the floating of shares , she said it was done to ensure maximum public participation and ownership of the Letshego shares with priority for citizens.
 
She said citizen empowerment and potential for financial gain through share value growth and dividends are some of the benefits that could be gained through this opportunity.
 
“This is also an opportunity for us to raise the profile of Letshego in Namibia among members of the general public, investors and target markets within Namibia, and to accelerate the rate of economic growth by stimulating entrepreneurship and investment,” she stated.
 
LHN opened its doors in 2002 as Edu-Loan Namibia, providing consumer and micro-lending services. In August 2008, Letshego Holdings Limited, a Botswana Stock Exchange-listed entity, acquired 100 per cent of the company, soon after which the company re-branded to Letshego Financial Services Namibia.
 
Currently, the Botswana Stock Exchange-listed entity owns 65 per cent of shares in Letshego Namibia, whilst 15 per cent is retained by Kumwe Investments Holding.
 
The Bank of Namibia has given the foreign-owned bank until the 2020 to comply with requirements that locals should hold at least 40 percent equity in commercial lenders operating in the country. An individual will only be allowed to buy a minimum number of 200 shares, which means the least amount they can offer is N$940."

The prospectus reveals that the firm plans to sell an 18% stake in the company, which will be increased to 20% within 24 months after the initial public offering. The company’s board and shareholders agreed to tender 657,179,319 of the company’s 3,651,909,200 shares. With the firm’s authorised share capital currently at Shs45,648,865,000, it means that the issued shares are valued at Shs3,651,909,200 or Shs12.5 per share.
 
Emmanuel Katongole, the company’s executive chairman, said the offer “is a sale of shares by the selling shareholders” and is not aimed at raising capital. “The Company is well capitalised, is cash generative and has sufficient resources to self-fund its growth and, as such, does not anticipate the need to raise any primary capital at this time,” Mr Katongole said in a statement published in the prospectus.

The offer shares will comprise shares offered by Cipla EU, a United Kingdom subsidiary of Cipla Ltd, Capitalworks, a South African private equity firm, the three Ugandan founders, and Amistad, a Mauritius-registered company controlled by TLG Capital. Cipla EU is to sell all its shares, currently 11.25% of the company’s issued shares, while Capitalworks will see its stake reduce to 11.11% from the current 14.4%. Amistad’s stake will reduce by 1% to 11.50% after the offer.
 
The three Ugandan founders – Emmanuel Katongole, George Baguma, and Frederick Mutebi Kitaka – will each own 2.78% after the offer, from the current 3.60% each. Only Mediatab, a Mauritius-registered company wholly owned by Cipla Ltd, will retain the same stake, 51.05%, it currently owns after the initial public offering.
 
A preliminary prospectus is filed by a firm with the securities industry regulator before its initial public offering and is “intended to provide pertinent information to prospective shareholders about the company’s business, managers, strategic initiatives, financial statements, and ownership structure.”
 
The document is issued before the offering price is determined by the underwriter. The price will be determined after the book building process – in which the underwriter tries to determine the IPO price based on the demand of the shares from institutional investors – and will be included in the final prospectus, which is expected to be published on 10 August.
 
According to the preliminary prospectus, the book building for Cipla Quality Chemicals opened on 26 July and will close on 9 August. The IPO will open to retail investors on 13 August, allowing them to take part in the offer, and will close on 24 August. The company expects to be admitted to listing and trading on the USE on 24 September.
 
The Kenyan subsidiary of Renaissance Capital, the investment bank, is the lead advisor on the transaction as well as the sole underwriter, while Bowmans (AF Mpanga Advocates) was retained as legal counsel.
 
Other advisors are Ernst & Young Limited as reporting accountants, Standard Chartered Bank as the receiving bank, and C&R Group as registrar of the company. Crested Capital is the transaction’s lead sponsoring broker.
 
However, as is spelt out in the prospectus, those dates could be amended and extended if Cipla Quality Chemicals, the Uganda Securities Exchange, and the Capital Markets Authority agree."

Nigeria’s IROKO to file for IPO on London Stock Exchange,https://www.african-markets.com/en/news/west-africa/nigeria/nigeria-s-iroko-to-file-for-ipo-on-london-stock-exchange," February 10, 2021 6:06 PM",2022-10-13 03:44:47.960085,"Nigerian-based media company, IROKO plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market in 2022.
 
Founded in 2011 by Jason Njoku and Bastian Gotter, Iroko is one of Africa’s first mainstream online movie streaming websites, and it has the world’s largest online catalog of Nollywood films.
 
According to TheAfricaReport, the media company will raise between $20 million and $30 million valuing the company at $80 million to $100 million. Discussions with brokers will start in the coming weeks. Njoku holds a stake of 18% in the debt-free company.





In 2020, Irokotv planned to increase its average revenue per user in Africa from $7-8 to $20-25. It seemed the company was set to achieve that until the pandemic came. Consumer spending in Nigeria and other African markets reduced and subscriptions dropped by 70% but international subscribers grew by 200% during the lockdown hitting a $25-30 ARPU range.
 
Jason Njoku told TechCrunch that, “The costs of pursuing Africa growth is what was really resized dramatically. We were so focused on defending Africa and basically ended up doing nothing. Zero marketing or anything to drive that.
 
“We pulled back to focus on where our economics actually makes sense. Our international business organically grew double-digit in 2020 and we expect it to continue this way for the foreseeable future.”
 
Why London Stock Exchange?

IROKO makes 80% of its revenue outside Africa and listing on a foreign exchange will help consolidate its efforts. According to Njoku, the Nigerian Stock Exchange or other local exchanges do not have a history of listing early-stage tech companies; therefore, the London Stock Exchange makes more sense in the short term.
The company is focusing more on international subscribers primarily in the U.S and the U.K where it has been able to execute a 150% price increase from $25 per year to $60 per year without any negative impact.
The company is seeking a market cap of about $100 million, which is small for the primary market. This is why it is choosing to list on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the LSE. A sub-market of the LSE, the AIM is built specifically for small-cap companies.

 
IROKO secured around $30 million in total during its Series E funding in January 2016 and it plans to raise less or a similar amount when going public in 2022.

The IPO comes after a six-year drought since Umeme (UMEM) listed on the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) in 2012.
It will bring the number of locally listed companies on USE to nine. Currently, USE has eight locally listed stocks and eight cross-listed companies – all from Kenya.
The company, according to the prospectus that has been sent to the Capital Markets Authority for approval, hopes to put on offer more than 657 million shares, through which the public will own a share of Uganda’s largest pharmaceutical firm.
Renaissance Capital will be the lead transaction advisor while Crested Capital will be the lead sponsor for the IPO that is expected to mobilise at least Shs100b, according to sources familiar with the process.

Cipla Quality Chemicals, according to the prospectus, is currently conducting a book building process that will inform its final figures and decision.
The company is currently owned by a consortium of investors. At 62.3 per cent, Meditab Holdings holds the largest stake.
The Indian drug maker and biotechnology company, which sells under the Cipla trading name hopes to hold 51 per cent after the IPO.
Other shareholders include Capitalworks Investment Partners (14.4 per cent), TLG Capital, which intends to sell part of its 12.50 per cent stake and Mr Emmanuel Katongole, who holds 3.6 per cent.
Mr Katongole, the Cipla Quality Chemicals chairman and a founding director, hopes to reduce his shareholding to 1.80 per cent after the IPO.
Mr Frederick Mutebi Kitaka and Mr George Baguma are also expected to reduce their respective shareholding from the 3.6 per cent they currently hold. Mr Katongole yesterday told Daily Monitor they will begin discussing particulars of the intended IPO on Monday, declaiming to divulge into details.
In 2004, Quality Chemicals partnered with Cipla and the government of Uganda to form a joint venture that would later establish one of the largest pharmaceutical industries in East Africa.
The government of Uganda in 2010 divested from the drug manufacturer, selling its stake to Cipla Quality Chemicals at a transaction that was valued at about $5m (Shs18.7b).
Mr Keith Kalyegira, the Capital Market Authority chief executive officer, yesterday said the IPO indicates growing confidence in Uganda’s equity markets, which has afforded the public to own a share of some of Uganda prime companies.
“The more people believe the more we shall see investor participate. It is a very strong confidence move that [Cipla Quality Chemicals] has taken,” he said.
Companies, he said, are increasingly finding relevant to mobilise cheap resources through the stock exchange instead of resorting to banks, whose interest rates are increasingly becoming volatile.

The IPO, which was opened to East African investors –from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi— raised Sh16.94 billion (Ush535.9 billion).

In a statement issued last Friday, the bank said over 12 500 applications were received from local and one international investor(s), to the value N$1,4 billion.
 
The initial public offer was for 81 million shares, however, investors demanded 160 million shares, leading to an oversubscription of almost twice the public offer.
 
The 81 million shares offer raised N$722,2 million.





Retail applicants, including individuals, rendered 12 478 applications and they will all be considered, the bank said.
 
Institutional investors including pension funds and investment companies made 45 applications to the value of N$1,1 billion, an indication that the market is indeed flooded with money looking for investments.
 
Only one international investor was attracted to the Standard Bank offer, making an application worth N$70 million.
 
While all the retail applicants would be allocated a stake in the bank, only 41,58% of N$1 billion worth of applications rendered by institutional investors will be accepted and 20% of the N$70 million from the international investor will be considered.
 
The rejection of part of the Namibian institutional investors and the international investor will result in at least N$700 million that should look for investments elsewhere.
 
Vetumbuavi Mungunda, the bank's chief executive officer, had said although it was an odd time to list, the bank is going to operate for the long term and for that reason he said what the economy was going through now is just a cycle.
 
From the turnout, it appears investors were convinced by his talk amid the bank's high dependency on the property market, an alarmingly high non-performing loan ration, minimal digitisation and them not being engaged in the micro-lending market. This seemed not to ward off investors.
 
One would say the interest rested in the bank's loan book growth in these difficult times, a better earnings per share and solid parent company, Standard Bank SA.
 
The Namibian has reported that the market is flooded with too much money looking for investments, and the over-subscription of Standard Bank's shares confirms this.
 
According to PSG Wealth Namibia's analysis of the public offer results, the offer was oversubscribed 1,98 times.
 
Following the conclusion of the allocation from the public offer, Standard Bank is expected to list on the main board of the Namibian Stock Exchange (NSX) with a free float of 25,1%.
 
The NSX has approved the listing of all the issued ordinary shares of SBN Holdings (SNO), from 09h00 on Friday, 15 November 2019.
 
According to the public offering prospectus, the main purpose of the public offer was to allow selected applicants and members of the public to participate directly in the equity growth and income streams of SBN Holdings.
 
The public offer was also to allow Standard Bank to broaden Namibian ownership in the group, broaden Namibian previously disadvantaged individual's ownership in the group and to provide the liquidity mechanism to unlock value for the Purros Scheme (an employee share trust).
 
There are, however, talks that shareholders in the Purros Scheme might sell their shares after 31 December 2019."

During an event to launch the shares over the weekend, JATU’s Managing Director Peter Isare said the capital will be injected into commercial farming and setting up processing factories to add value to agricultural produce.
 
“Our aim is to ensure that Tanzanians benefit from a whole value chain of the agriculture,” Mr Isare stated in Dar es Salaam.
 
The company will focus on crops that have high demand within the country, including maize, sunflower and rice as well as investing in modern farm equipment such as tractors.





“Support us in this new endeavour so that we can prove that we really want to transform agriculture in the country,” Mr Isare assured.
 
He said the agricultural projects that the form intends to venture into would also contribute to the country’s food security.
 
The launching of the shares under the IPO came after the Stock Exchange (DSE) temporarily suspended Jatu from trading for two months to pave the way for issuing an (IPO).
 
The bourse said the suspension started June 1st and would last up to July 28th as the firm wants to list 15,000,000 new shares in a way of splitting whereby an IPO price is 500/- a share,
 
Normally when the firm splits its shares, the number of shares of that company increase, but the ‘market capitalisation’ remains the same and as the number of shares increases, the price per share goes down.
 
Orbit Securities Head of Research and Analytics, Imani Muhingo, said the suspension was ‘a well procedural’ since Jatu is an IPO from the beginning of this month.
 
“It’s self-defeating if the shares would still be trading in the secondary market” while others are in the primary market, Mr Muhingo told Daily News yesterday.
 
Jatu, the agri-based firm share was trading 1,200/- before the suspension on Tuesday against 420/- during listing late last November.
 
Vertex International Securities Ahmed Nganya seconded Mr Muhingo said the “temporary suspension was to allow for the IPO of new Jatu shares that take place” between 1st June and 15 July.
DSE said in a statement that the suspension following the guidance from Capital Markets and Securities Authority (CMSA) necessitate the harmonization of Jatu’s corporation actions.
The statement said all shares, following the share split for existing shares together with new shares subscribed during the IPO, will be credited electronically and deposited in the Central Depository System on July 29th to enable secondary trading.
Jatu runs and manages various agricultural projects in collaboration with its members, which currently totalling at over 30,000 members.

The telecom, a South African MTN Group subsidiary, said Tuesday that it had received regulatory approvals to list 20 percent of its shareholding.
 
The firm said Tuesday that it would disclose details of the offer in its prospectus to be released on October 11.
 
Uganda’s Capital Markets Authority (CMA) Chief Executive Keith Kalyegira said the IPO is expected to raise about $1.2 billion.





“The intention to float announcement is a major step towards delivering on our plan to list on the USE,” MTN Uganda chairman Charles Mbire told reporters.
 
The widely anticipated stake sale of the leading telecom in Uganda will be restricted to citizens of the East African Community trading bloc, Ugandan regulators said earlier.
 
Besides Kenya and Uganda, the other members of the EAC are Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.
 
The IPO is expected to boost the number of retail investors at the Uganda Securities Exchange from about 40,000 to 200,000 investors.
 
The listing will make MTN Uganda the second publicly traded telecom in EAC after Safaricom’s IPO on the Nairobi Securities Exchange in 2008.
 
“This will potentially be the largest IPO on the Ugandan market and will be delivered primarily through a digital paperless/ green platform which is the first of its kind in East Africa,” said MTN Uganda in a statement.
 
 
Licence condition
“The offer and listing of MTN Uganda is in line with MTN Group’s localisation plans to drive local ownership in the markets within which MTN operates,” the firm said.
 
The Ugandan government set the listing of telecoms on the local bourse as one of its licence renewal conditions to allow local ownership of big companies with few large shareholders.
 
MTN Group Ltd of South Africa owns more than 90 percent of the company’s shares, while a Ugandan businessman holds less than five percent shares. 
 
MTN Uganda, which has 15 million subscribers, had its operating licence renewed for 12 years in February last year after paying $100 million with the local listing requirement as a precondition for the permit nod.
 
“We are delighted to witness the honouring of this commitment by MTN,” said Irene Kaggwa-Sewankambo, the Executive Director of the Uganda Communications Commission.
 
MTN Uganda was granted two years starting July 1 2020, to list 20 percent of its equity on the Ugandan Securities Exchange.
 
“This IPO gives Ugandans an opportunity to own a piece of the company,” said USE chief executive Paul Bwiso on Tuesday.
 
MTN Uganda started operating in the country in 1998.
 
Although relatively small, Uganda’s telecoms and data market is seen as potentially lucrative because many of the country’s 42 million people are young.
 
Mobile penetration in Uganda grew from 0.27 percent in 1998 to 67 percent as of March 2021 underlining the sector's rapid growth."
Tanzania: Halotel Makes Progress in Floating IPO At Dar Bourse,https://www.african-markets.com/en/stock-markets/dse/tanzania-halotel-makes-progress-in-floating-ipo-at-dar-bourse," January 25, 2018 10:13 PM",2022-10-13 03:44:59.997507,"Halotel Tanzania has submitted its prospectus to the Capital Markets and Security Authority (CMSA) to be considered for floating an initial public offering (IPO) at Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE).
 
CSMA principal public relations officer Charles Shirima confirmed that Halotel the company submitted its prospectus late last year.
 
Halotel is among telecommunications companies that are yet to float 25 per cent of their shares through an initial public offering at DSE in accordance with the Electronic and Postal Communication Act (2010).
 
“We returned the prospectus to Halotel because it lacked some regulatory requirements. After we finalise working on it, the company shares will be floated at the market,” he said.

If the prospectus is approved by CMSA, Halotel Tanzania, which is owned by the Vietnamese government, will be the second to float an IPO behind Vodacom Tanzania, which was listed last year.
 
The quarterly communications statistics report of 2017, shows that Halotel had the lowest tariffs on SMS both locally and internationally, charging Sh30 and Sh95 respectively. Halotel had 3.7 million voice subscribers as of September, last year, which was 9 per cent of the mobile telecom market share.
 
According to the report, 442,512 people subscribed for Halotel mobile money, which made two per cent of total mobile money subscription. Recently, organisers of the International Business Awards (Steve Awards 2017) named Viettel Tanzania PLC, which trades as Halotel Tanzania, as the fastest-growing enterprise in Africa and the Middle East. For the past two years, Halotel Tanzania has managed to register 3.5 million customers, ranking fourth among eight telecoms operating in Tanzania. The firm overtook some mobile operators that have existed longer. Halotel was launched in October 2015 and deployed in all 26 Tanzanian regions. This was Viettel’s fourth investment in Africa after Movitel, Lumitel and Nexttel in Mozambique, Burundi and Cameroon respectively. Viettel started investing in the country in 2011 and planned $736 million in investment after then-President Jakaya Kikwete visited Vietnam.
 
The entry of Viettel also saw further liberalisation of the communication sector, with the government allowing private companies to lay their own optic fibre cables. The company had promised to connect several public institutions around the country with the optic fibre network and connect over 1,500 villages to the telecommunications grid that were previously not served. The company also tried to partner with state-owned energy company Tanzania Electric Supply Company to use the utility firm’s power poles to serve as antennas."

It said in a statement that 60 per cent of the offer was raised through subscriptions by Tanzania investors and 40 per cent of the offer from international investors. “We are proud and excited that many Tanzanians have participated in the offer and supported our company.
 
We also thank investors from outside the country for their support and confidence in our company,” the telecom firm said.

Vodacom offered 560,000,100 ordinary shares at a price of 850/- in the country’s biggest share sale opened from March to July after the government ordered all telecommunications companies in the country to sell at least a 25 per cent stake on the Dar es Salaam exchange to boost domestic ownership.
 
“We look forward to the public investors becoming our shareholders and to the listing of our company, and to be part of our company’s vision to lead Tanzania into the digital age and change lives through technology.”
 
It was expected once completed, the IPO will boost the bourse’s capitalisation by at least 2.4 per cent to about 20.7tri/-. This is a significant landmark transaction for the country, being the largest IPO in the history of Tanzania’s capital markets and has attracted more than 40,000 Tanzanian investors, most of whom are first time participants in the capital markets in Tanzania.
 
The CMSA has approved the shareholders’ register reflecting these results, ready for crediting the allotted shares to the respective shareholders’ Central Securities Depository (CSD) accounts.
 
In accordance with the IPO timetable approved by the CMSA and included in the Addendum to the Vodacom Tanzania Prospectus, 7th August, 2017 was the official announcement date of the results of the IPO.
 
According to the statement, following completion of the CSD Accounts postings, Vodacom Tanzania shares will be listed on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) on 15th August, 2017 under the ticker “VODA” and trading in the Vodacom shares shall commence on the same day."

Trading on e-finance’s shares will begin on Wednesday, October 18th, opening at EGP 13.98 per share, Sarhan pointed out, adding that the IPO values at around EGP 5.8 billion ($367 million).
 
On Sunday, the Egyptian Exchange (EGX) announced that the public offering of e-finance was oversubscribed by almost 61.36x, with total purchase orders placed on 1.581 billion shares.

Egypt prepares for second wave of IPOs,https://www.african-markets.com/en/stock-markets/egx/egypt-prepares-for-second-wave-of-ipos," August 21, 2019 11:15 AM",2022-10-13 03:45:02.874319,"Egypt’s government is gearing up to implement the second wave of Initial Public Offerings (IPO) in September.
 
Minister of the Public Business Sector Hisham Tawfik has said on Monday that preparations are underway to offer stakes in two state-owned companies, including Banque du Caire.
 
Tawfik declared in April that the second wave will involve new sectors that are not listed on the Egyptian Stock Market (EGX) in a bid to attract more investments and energise the stock market, as well as provide cash liquidity in the domestic market.





The governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has announced that Banque du Caire will offer a stake of its shares, ranging between 30 and 40 percent, which is expected to garner between $300 million and $400 million at the most.
 
Official sources say that the government will also offer a share of 10 to 15 percent of E-finance, a national company which is operating the Egyptian government's financial network with a paid capital of EGP 350.5 million, to be the second company offered alongside Banque du Caire.
 
Head of E-finance Ibrahim Sarhan told Ahram Online that the offering ""is subject to the government’s will, it is not a final order.""
 
“We are already working on studying the market. We will finish our work within a month-and-a-half and all the results of our study will be announced in a press conference before the offering process,” Sarhan added.
 
The second phase of the IPO will include new sectors that do not exist on the Egyptian stock exchange, which will attract more investors, Minister Tawfik said.
 
Tawfik added that the strategic objectives of the government’s IPO programme are to expand the ownership base, increase governance practices and private sector participation in management, and provide the necessary financing to restructure and develop companies.
 
He stressed that the offering will be for profitable companies only, noting that good preparation and timing are among the most important guarantees for the success of the proposal process.
 
“It also depends on external factors, including macro-economic, global markets, and other internal factors related to the stability of the company's operations,"" he said.
 
The minister also emphasised the importance of the role of the investor relations officer.
 
In 2016, Egypt announced the launch of the IPO programme by offering a portion of state-owned company’s shares in the EGX to revive the market as part of the country's economic reform programme.
 
The goal from the IPO is to attract investments flows to the domestic market and make ultimate use of state assets.
 
The programme is scheduled to be fully implemented within three to five years over 23 companies and banks in various sectors, including real estate, services, petroleum, and chemicals, targeting to collect approximately EGP 8 billion, according to the financial initial statement of the fiscal year FY2019/20 budget.
 
Previously, in March, Egypt offered a stake of 4.5 percent of Eastern Company’s shares on the EGX with a total value of EGP 1.72 billion. Emirati Mohamed Alabbar and Saudi Arabian investors had acquired more than 25 percent of the company's shares with a total of EGP 400 million."
Tanzania: Maxcom On the Threshold of IPO,https://www.african-markets.com/en/stock-markets/dse/tanzania-maxcom-on-the-threshold-of-ipo," January 09, 2018 8:32 PM",2022-10-13 03:45:03.613783,"A leading ICT integration firm in Tanzania, Maxcom Africa Limited, is currently in the final stages of preparing to submit its draft to the Capital Markets and Securities Authority (CMSA) for listing on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE). Mr Raphael Masumbuko – the chief executive officer of Zan Securities Limited, who are providing advisory services to Maxcom – told The Citizen that they were seriously considering February this year as the month in which to launch the company’s initial public offering (IPO).
 
“We’re considering February as the right time to open the IPO because the economy of the country (Tanzania) will be stable –and members of the public would have already finished dealing with their January financial obligations,” he said, referring to the myriad expenses that are usually associated with the month of January such as rent, school fees, etc.
 
“Although it’s not mandatory for Maxcom to launch an IPO, we nonetheless consider February to be the perfect time in which to start an IPO. We expect the company to be listed on the local bourse (DSE) by February or March this year,” the Zan Securities chief stated.

Mr Masumbuko further explained that, apart from Maxcom, several companies have shown interest in listing on the DSE. However, he would not divulge their names or other details, ostensibly because “they were not yet ready for that kind of publicity.”
 
Currently, Maxcom operates in six African countries, namely Tanzania – which hosts the firm’s headquarters – Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and Burundi.
 
The firm’s board chairman, Prof Samwel Wangwe of Tanzania, recently said that the listing would enable the company to freely operate in compliance with the country’s laws and regulations.
 
According to the chairman, the application to go public was aimed at conforming with Tanzania’s Electronic and Postal Communication Act of 2010, and the Finance Act (2016), which requires communications operators to offload a minimum of 25 per cent of their shares on the general public.
 
June last year, Tanzania President John Pombe Magufuli ordered the revocation of operation licences for mobile telephony companies which were not willing, able or ready to list with DSE.
 
In the event, Dr Magufuli directed the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) to act tough against stubborn companies – emphasizing that all mobile phone firms operating in the country were required to float shares on the bourse.
 
Maxcom chairman Wangwe said implementation of the president’s directive would improve the company’s efficiency.
 
In that regard, the good professor stressed that he would strive throughout his term to efficaciously manage the company, and expand its activities within and beyond the country’s borders.
 
“Listing at the DSE will enhance” all that, Prof Wangwe confidently stated."

Nigeria: Why Geregu listed by Way of Introduction and not by IPO,https://www.african-markets.com/en/stock-markets/ngse/nigeria-why-geregu-listed-by-way-of-introduction-and-not-by-ipo," October 12, 2022 2:32 PM",2022-10-13 03:45:05.613930,"Geregu Power Plc (NGX:GEREGU) is a power generation company incorporated in 2006 and commissioned in 2007. The Company is principally engaged in the generation and sale of electric power.
 
Geregu’s power plant is wholly owned and operated by Amperion Power Distribution Company Limited (“APDCL”).
 
On Wednesday, October 5, 222, the company became the first power-generating company in the country to be admitted with the Mainboard of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) by way of listing by introduction with the admittance of 2.5 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each at N100 per share on the Exchange.
 
The listing added N250 billion to the market capitalization of NGX. On its first trading day on the NGX, the Power generating company’s share gained 10% to close at N110 per share from the N100 per share it was listed by introduction.
 
Meanwhile at the close of the last trading on Tuesday, October 11, 2022, it closed at 120.90 and thus has gained 9.91%, ranking it 39th on the NGX in terms of year-to-date performance and the 14th most valuable stock with a market capitalization of N302 billion.
 





 
Why Geregu listed by way of Introduction
Most companies prefer an Initial Public Offer ” IPO” during the listing, where new shares are created, underwritten, and sold to the public. During secondary trading on the NGX, ownership of shares is simply transferred from one investor to another.
 
IPO listing is a bit cumbersome and costly for most companies; hence some companies list their stocks via Listing by Way of Introduction (LBI).

In LBI, the company listing does not have to undergo the book building, underwriting, and public offer process, and no new shares are created; only existing, outstanding shares are sold.
This means Geregu Power Plc listing by introduction entails that only existing shareholders of Geregu in this case, its owners trade their already existing shares with anyone who may be interested in buying a piece of the company.
Amperion Power Distribution Company Limited owns the largest share in Geregu Power Plc.

Companies may opt for listing by the introduction to time the market and avoid or reduce market uncertainties or for other reasons not because they need money immediately.

For example, in 2019, Nigeria’s leading telecommunication company, MTNN listed by introduction on the NGX and prior to going public, had announced earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation of N453.1bn ($1.27bn) for the 2018 financial year.
Also, recall that Geregu Power Plc in July 2022 announced its debut of N40.085 billion senior unsecured bonds under its N100 billion multi-instrument bond issuance in the debt market, which was over-subscribed.
The issuance which started on July 1, 2022, following Security and Exchange Commission’s approval closed on July 14, 2022, with a bond yield of 14.50%

 
Company Performance
The audited financial statements of the power generating company submitted to the regulators show that, in terms of earnings, the company, met the NGX listing requirement of a pre-tax profit from continuing operation of not less than N300million cumulatively for the last three (3) fiscal years and a minimum of N100 million in two (2) of these years.

The company’s last pre-listing financial year (2021) profit before tax stood at N29.512 billion; 43% up from N20.649 billion in 2020, while profit after tax was up 45.49% to N20.550 billion from N14.125 billion in 2020FY and earnings per share jumped to N2,055 per share from N1,412.54 in 2020.
Over the past four years (2018 -2021), the average profit after tax is N18.782 billion or 25% average growth per year, resulting in an impressive average net profit margin of 28% per year.

Bottom Line: Overall, when deciding to invest in shares of Geregu Power Plc, take a similar approach as if you are investing in IPO shares. Read the listing document or prospectus of the company to understand the business nature, its performance, which we have highlighted herein, and its outlook, to find out any corporate action recently taken such as dividend distribution or any possible risk."

Egyptian Exchange awaits 6 new IPOs in 2022,https://www.african-markets.com/en/stock-markets/egx/egyptian-exchange-awaits-6-new-ipos-in-2022," February 10, 2022 11:27 AM",2022-10-13 03:45:14.856572,"An opinion poll conducted by Daily News Egypt on the expected initial public offerings (IPOs) during 2022, revealed that three government IPOs and another three private ones are expected this year. 
 
The first quarter (1Q) of this year will witness two offerings, one from the public sector and the other from the private sector. The first of which is Macro Group for Pharmaceuticals, which is expected to be offered in February, the second is the IPO of the state-owned football company, Ghazl El-Mahalla SC.
 
Mohamed Omran, the Chairperson of the Financial Regulatory Authority, expected the shares of Macro Group for Pharmaceuticals to debut on the stock exchange (EGX) this month.
 
He added that the list of propositions includes the offering of Ghazl El-Mahalla SC Company, which will be its first time under the public subscription system. “There is also another company which is currently communicating with the authority to complete its offering on the EGX under the public subscription system during the coming period,” he revealed.
 





 
Omran expects that 2022 will witness a large number of IPOs.
 
“Companies affiliated with the Egyptian Armed Forces are expected to be offered this year, in addition to the government IPO programme and the private sector’s offerings.
 
Mohamed Maher, the CEO of Prime Holding — which is responsible for the offering — said that the procedures for offering Ghazl El-Mahalla SC on the EGX are expected to be completed by the end of February or March at the latest. He added that the IPO will be incorporated as a new company with an initial capital of EGP 200m. 
 
The remaining unissued capital in the offered shares will come in the form of an in-kind contribution from the Misr Spinning and Weaving Company.
 
Moreover, sources closely related to the offering of the Ebtikar for financial services said that the company’s IPO is expected after the Eid Al-Fitr holiday (in May), as an agreement is currently underway with an independent financial adviser to prepare fair value studies. 
 
Also, the company is awaiting the approval of the relevant authorities regarding the implementation of the Vodafone deal, which completed its due diligence checks.
 
Among the private sector companies expected to be listed on the Egyptian Exchange during the second half (2H) of 2022 is Abu Auf.
 
Also, sources told Daily News Egypt that the government IPO programme will witness the offering of three other state-owned companies’ shares in the EGX before the end of the current fiscal year. The government IPO programme resumed with the e-finance IPO in 2021, following a long hiatus after selling a secondary stake in the Eastern Company in March 2019. 
 




 
Besides Ghazl El-Mahalla SC, Banque du Caire is the most prominent of these IPOs, and it is expected to be completed during 2H of 2022.
 
It is worth noting that Qalaa Holding has announced the postponement of the listing of TAQA Arabia on the EGX again to 2023 when market conditions are expected to improve.
 
TAQA Arabia was supposed to debut in 2020, however, the company postponed the offering to 2021 and then decided last week to postpone it again till next year.
 
Followers of the Egyptian financial markets have always wondered when can Egypt catch up with global financial markets in terms of the number and sizes of IPOs.
 
Recently, Arab stock exchanges have witnessed more IPOs compared to EGX; after a disappointing year for Egyptian IPOs, dealers are waiting for a new year with better investment opportunities.
 
The EGX only witnessed 3 offerings in 2021 with a value of EGP 7.95bn, including two companies in the main market and another in the small projects market, with little growth compared to 2020, which witnessed 1 offering of EGP 200m.
 
Last year, the EGX witnessed the offering of e-finance, which debuted with 1.6bn shares with a value of EGP 5.84bn, along with Taaleem Management Services with 730.3m shares with a value of EGP 2.1bn. While the IPO of Emerald for Development and Project Management in the SMEs market with 425m shares worth EGP 57.6m. 
 
Emerald Real Estate Investment Company was also offered on the Nile Stock Exchange with a value of EGP 200m.
 
Looking over the past year, global IPOs witnessed their best performance in 20 years, with 2,388 deals worth $453.3bn, according to data released by Ernst & Young, increasing deals by 64% year-on-year (y-o-y). Issuance revenue also jumped by 67% y-o-y.
 
The US continued to dominate the global IPO markets, as it acquired about 80% of all deals in the Americas region, which contributed to an increase in the number of regional deals by 87% y-o-y to 528 deals, while the value of issuances amounted to $174.6bn."

        According to insiders, most of the cuts should be limited to underperformers in investment banking, who are really feeling the pinch of weak deal flow in equity capital markets and advisory services. As Insider has previously reported, mortgage-lending units are also exposed to job cuts.

1. Wall Street executives see job cuts as a return to banking's life cycle: Cull your weakest links to ensure that the well-oiled machine keeps running with fresh talent for an evolving business.
    




        For many, the return of staff cuts is kind of a return to normalcy. In capital markets, the dealmaking volumes of 2020 and 2021 were always going to be a rarity. Record sales in the bond market, a deluge of initial public offerings thanks in part to the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) boom, and trillions of dollars in private-equity cash meant happy days for M&A bankers in 2021.
    




        But that has come to a screeching halt.
    




        Today's world of increased interest rates, slowing growth, and stubbornly high inflation have left some bankers with fewer deals to execute. While many have solid pipelines of work, the reality is that it's not enough to justify the current staffing levels.
    




        After all, bank CEOs are beholden to their shareholders and must do what it takes to trim expenses and improve their stock prices.

Flutterwave is considering an IPO amid a PR nightmare





        Flutterwave is reportedly considering an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the US and Nigeria, according to Bloomberg. Sources familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that the recent recruitments into key positions at Flutterwave were all in preparation for the IPO. Recall that Flutterwave had recently hired Oneal Bhamban, a former VP at American Express, as its new Chief Financial Officer. Also, the company hired Gurbhej Dhillon, a former MD at Goldman Sachs, as its new Chief Technology Officer.
    




        Besides that, Flutterwave has been grappling with a slew of reputation-damaging allegations and regulatory hurdles since the start of 2022. Just two days ago, a Kenyan High Court granted an order to freeze an additional sum of $3.3 million (Sh400.6 million) belonging to the pan-African fintech giant.
    




        Kenya's Assets Recovery Agency (ARA), which is leading an investigation into the fintech firm, had filed to block the funds from being transferred. The agency also accused Flutterwave of money laundering and seeks to have the frozen millions forfeited to the government."
"DWAC says a drop in Trump's popularity could hurt Truth Social, and will ask investors to vote on delaying the IPO",https://africa.businessinsider.com/markets/dwac-says-a-drop-in-trumps-popularity-could-hurt-truth-social-and-will-ask-investors/ptqr7kg,"August 22, 2022 6:31 PM",2022-10-13 03:43:58.819257,"Digital World Acquisition Corp. on Monday raised the prospect of delaying merger plans with Donald Trump's social media company, saying that Trump's business could be dented by a potential decline in the former US president's popularity.
    




        Digital World Acquisition Corp. will hold a shareholder meeting on September 6 over whether to extend the date by which it must complete its plan to take public Trump Media & Technology Group, the firm that runs Trump's Truth Social platform. DWAC informed shareholders of the meeting in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.





        ""The success of the Business Combination depends in part on the popularity of TMTG's brand and the reputation and popularity of its Chairman, President Donald J. Trump. The value of TMTG's brand may diminish if the popularity of President Trump were to suffer,"" said DWAC.
    




        DWAC's stakeholders may decide in favor of extending the merger deadline by one year, to September 8, 2023. DWAC said may be forced to liquidate if a business combination doesn't materialize.
    




        Trump's popularity, reputation, and image are key factors in the success of TMTG, said DWAC, noting that TMTG believes there is ""sufficient demand for a true free speech platform,"" such as Trump's Truth Social app that he launched in February.
    




        News of the meeting comes as Trump is the subject of at least three major investigations related to the 2020 election, the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol, and his finances. The FBI raided Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort residence in Palm Beach, Florida, earlier this month as part of a Department of Justice probe into potential obstruction of justice and Espionage Act violations by Trump.
    




        DWAC in its filing cited a survey by The Hill news site saying only 30% of respondents would use a social media site associated with Trump and cited a New York Post survey that found only 60% of Republicans saying they would use such a platform.
    




        ""In order to be successful, TMTG will need millions of those people to register and regularly use TMTG's platform,"" said DWAC. ""If President Trump becomes less popular or there are further controversies that damage his credibility or the desire of people to use a platform associated with him, and from which he will derive financial benefit, TMTG's results of operations, as well as the outcome of the proposed Business combination, could be adversely affected.""
    




        DWAC shares during Monday's session were up about 1% at $30.24. The stock has lost about 41% during 2022."
The IPO drought is about to break with Porsche set to raise $9.4 billion in its public debut,https://africa.businessinsider.com/markets/the-ipo-drought-is-about-to-break-with-porsche-set-to-raise-dollar94-billion-in-its/0h9kmfv,"September 20, 2022 4:54 PM",2022-10-13 03:44:01.478358,"The public debut of the luxury car maker is being facilitated by its parent company, Volkswagen, which is set to receive nearly $10 billion in proceeds from the IPO after it sells some of its stake.
    




        The German auto giant, the world's second-largest car company by volume, plans to use the proceeds to fund its ambitious electric vehicle ambitions. The company could also use some of the IPO proceeds to pay a special dividend to its investors in early 2023, according to Reuters.





        Porsche had initially been targeting a valuation of up to $85 billion, but has since lowered its targeted valuation range to between $70.1 billion to $75.1 billion.
    




        Porsche's public debut will help break an ongoing drought in the IPO market, which has been devastated by a rolling bear market in stocks amid concerns of high inflation, soaring energy prices, and a potential economic recession.
    




        The US IPO market has suffered one of its longest stretches of minimal debuts since the unraveling of the dot-com bubble about 20 years ago. But it's the same story globally. According to data from Bloomberg, the global IPO market has raised just $80.5 billion, spread out over 1,617 deals so far in 2022.
    




        That's in stark comparison to 2021's global IPO market, which raised more than $700 billion across more than 4,000 deals.
    




        Despite the overhang in capital markets, Porsche's confidence to go public is bolstered by a commitment from several investors to buy a large tranche of shares. A combination of the Qatar Investment Authority, T. Rowe Price, and Norway's sovereign wealth fund will purchase nearly 40% of the share offering.
    




        The investors could be eyeing potential upside that was realized in peer luxury car maker Ferrari when it went public in 2015. Ferrari saw its valuation soar from about $10 billion when it went public to about $35 billion today.
    




        And the potential positive investor reception towards Porsche's upcoming share offering could send a signal to investors that the IPO drought is nearing its end. But that will also be influenced by the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate hike decision as it continues to tighten policy, harming risk assets and denting investor sentiment."
Trump-linked SPAC falls as the company gives shareholders more time to vote on extending a merger deadline with Truth Social,https://africa.businessinsider.com/markets/trump-linked-spac-falls-as-the-company-gives-shareholders-more-time-to-vote-on/x95pl0s,"September 6, 2022 2:20 PM",2022-10-13 03:44:11.785194,"Digital World Acquisition Corp. shares struggled with sharp losses Tuesday after the company gave its shareholders more time to vote on a proposal to extend a deadline to merge with Donald Trump's social media company.
    




        The company extended the window for voting by two days, until Thursday, with Digital World's CEO Patrick Orlando announcing the move during a special meeting on Tuesday afternoon. A Reuters report earlier Tuesday said the company hadn't won enough votes from shareholders to give it another 12 months to complete a proposed deal with Trump Media & Technology Group, or TMTG.
    




        Without enough shareholder support, the special purpose acquisition company is facing liquidation and would have to return money it had raised in its September 2021 initial public offering, Reuters reported.
    




        ""We are working diligently to record all votes that are continuing to come in from our stockholders and our adjourning this meeting to allow for additional time for stockholders to cast their votes,"" Orlando said at Tuesday's virtual meeting. TMTG runs the Truth Social networking app.
    




        Digital World shares pared their losses to 7% shortly after the end of the brief meeting that began at 12 p.m. Eastern. The stock was later down by 16%, returning to levels seen just before the meeting began.
    




        Digital World wants to extend a merger deadline by one year, to September 8, 2023. It needs 65% of shareholders to vote for the extension. By Monday evening, far fewer than that had voted in favor of the extension, sources had told Reuters. Digital World had previously said it may be forced to liquidate if a business combination didn't materialize.
    




        The stock earlier Tuesday had lost as much as 21% at $19.70, the lowest price since October 2021, when the stock soared on Digital World's plans to merge with Trump Media  Technology Group. Shares of Digital World in 2022 have lost about 59%.
    




        The Reuters report said at stake is a $1.3 billion cash infusion that Trump's company stands to receive from the SPAC if the deal is completed. If the deal were to be finalized, TMTG would receive $293 million from Digital World as well as $1 billion committed by investors in the form of a private investment in public equity, or PIPE.
    




        In August, Digital World raised the prospect of delaying the merger plans, saying that Trump's business could be hurt by a potential decline in his popularity. Trump is the subject of investigations related to the 2020 election, the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol, and his finances.
    




        The FBI raided Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort residence in Palm Beach, Florida, in August as part of a Department of Justice probe into potential obstruction of justice and Espionage Act violations by Trump. On Monday, a federal judge in Florida granted Trump's request for the court to appoint a special master to go over materials the FBI seized in its Mar-a-Lago search."

        The early version of its bike was 'janky,' and it struggled to find investors

        Foley is a self-professed ""boutique fitness addict,"" as well as an avid cyclist. But the early versions of the Peloton bike didn't look like something you'd find in a high-end fitness studio, the company's first instructor, Jenn Sherman, told Fortune. 
    




        ""They had this little tiny corner of the office that was sectioned off by black velvet curtains. There was a camera on a tripod sticking through a circle people literally cut out of the curtain. There was a janky, broken bike in there  the instructor bike was like this rusted piece of crap. It was ridiculous,"" she said. 
    




        Still, Sherman signed on. Meanwhile, Foley was on the road for the first three years, pitching what he told Insider in 2018 was as many as 400 investors. 
    




        ""I got 400 'nos,'"" he said at the time. ""The worst part is that we're not talking about 400 individual pitches. A lot of people would want me to come back four or five times and have me meet more partners and pitch again. I would say that I've been turned down maybe five or six thousand times.""
    




        Still, the company scraped together funding from more than 200 angel investors and put its first bike on Kickstarter in 2013 for an ""early bird"" price of $1,500.
    




        Peloton quickly developed a cult following

        Peloton began shipping bikes in 2014, with Foley and the other cofounders showing off how they worked at pop-up stores inside shopping centers.
    




        But it didn't take long for the company to develop a cult following, thanks in large part to its roster of high-wattage instructors. When the company opened its own studio in New York City, owners of the company's $2,000 bike would make a pilgrimage to Manhattan in order to take a live class with their favorite instructor. 
    




        Eventually, big-name investors came calling. ""I would say that it took about five years for the really smart money to start getting involved,"" Foley told Insider in 2018. ""When Mary Meeker is calling you to say, 'Hey, I want to invest'  that's pretty cool.""
    




        That year, Peloton raised $550 million in venture capital funding at a valuation of $4.1 billion, according to Pitchbook.

        Peloton introduced its second product, a $4,000 treadmill called the Peloton Tread, in 2018, and added new types of classes, like high-intensity interval training and yoga, to keep users engaged or get new customers to sign onto a digital subscription, no equipment required. 
    




        By 2019, the company had sold 577,000 bikes and treadmills. 
    




        In August of that year, Peloton filed for an initial public offering, revealing it had over 500,000 paying subscribers, but also spiraling losses from major investments in marketing and licensing music for its classes. 
    




        Peloton went public on September 26, 2019 in what was at the time the third-worst trading debut for a major IPO since the financial crisis.
    




        Peloton's stock plummeted following its 2019 holiday ad

        Ahead of the holidays in 2019, Peloton made what was seen as a major public misstep with its infamous ""Peloton wife"" ad. 
    




        The ad, featuring a woman whose husband gifts her a Peloton bike for Christmas, was viewed as being sexist and playing into outdated standards of beauty. Public outrage over the ad sent Peloton's stock plunging 9%, wiping out $942 million in market value in a single day. 
    




        But Peloton stood by the commercial, issuing a statement saying it was ""disappointed"" by how people had ""misinterpreted"" the ad. 
    




        The pandemic became a major boon for Peloton's business

        Then, in early 2020, the pandemic hit. Suddenly stuck inside, people turned to at-home fitness and found connection in Peloton's streamed workout classes. The company's share price took off. 
    




        By May 2020, Peloton reported a 66% increase in sales and a 94% increase in subscribers. In September of that year, Peloton said that it had had its first profitable quarter, with sales spiking 172% since the same quarter the year prior and revenue rising to $607 million. 
    




        But the unexpected uptick in demand showed the cracks in Peloton's logistics operation. Delivery times for new equipment became longer and longer, and Peloton's typically diehard fans began expressing their frustration online. 
    




        Then, some customers began experiencing issues with their bikes where pedals snapped off mid-ride. The company took weeks or months to make repairs, further frustrating users. After 120 reports of bikes breaking and 16 reports of customers getting injured, the company issued a recall affecting 30,000 bikes. 
    




        Still, 2020 was all around a stellar year for Peloton that included debuting new, higher-end versions of the bike and treadmill and inking a multi-year deal with Beyonc. A year after the ""Peloton wife"" ad, the company's market value had hit $34 billion. 
    




        In early 2021, Peloton reported its first-ever billion-dollar quarter, driven by holiday sales and sustained demand for at-home fitness as the pandemic raged on. Foley pledged to manufacture ""tens of millions"" of treadmills and bikes to keep up with surging sales and spend $100 million to speed up deliveries hampered by port congestion.

        But in March, tragedy struck when a child was fatally injured in an accident with a Peloton treadmill. Shares dipped 4% following the news and regulators urged a recall.
    




        Foley initially pushed back, calling the warnings ""inaccurate and misleading,"" but by May, the company announced a recall of the higher-end Tread+. 
    




        In an effort to make the treadmill safer, Peloton also made a change that resulted in it becoming unusable unless users paid $39 per month. Following customer outrage, the company said it would work on a fix. 
    




        As the pandemic began to recede, so did Peloton's popularity

        As the nation continued to move toward reopening  and returning to the gym and fitness studios  Peloton's business took a punch. The company's stock dropped 34% following its fiscal first-quarter earnings in November, which included a dismal outlook for the months ahead.  
    




        ""It is clear that we underestimated the reopening impact on our company and the overall industry,"" Foley said in a call with shareholders.
    




        Peloton was also being chased by rivals like Echelon and iFit Health, which offer similar, cheaper products. Peloton filed a lawsuit against them in November, accusing them of patent infringement. 
    




        In the meantime, Peloton had been taking reputational hits. A hiring freeze set in, and Black employees voiced concerns over their pay compared with the industry standard. A character in the ""Sex and the City"" reboot died after using his bike, and then the same thing happened to a ""Billions""character soon after. And in December, Foley threw a lavish holiday party as the company's stock tanked. 
    




        By January, the company was discussing layoffs, reportedly pausing production of new equipment, and halting plans to open a new $400 million factory. Employees told Insider the company's warehouses were filled with excess bikes. 
    




        Peloton began laying off employees, replaced Foley, and eyed a potential acquisition

        In February, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon was eyeing Peloton as a potential acquisition  soon after, the Financial Times reported that Nike was considering the same. Wall Street analysts posited that Apple would be another natural fit as the new owner of Peloton. 
    




        The possibility of a sale sent Peloton's stock jumping 25%.
    




        Days later, Foley announced that he would step down as Peloton's CEO and that the company was slashing 2,800 jobs, about 20% of its workforce. The company said that the fired employees would receive a free year's subscription to the platform, along with a ""meaningful cash severance allotment"" and other benefits. Its roster of instructors would not be impacted by the layoffs.
    




        During a conference call following the company's second-quarter earnings, Foley said was taking responsibility for what happened at Peloton. 
    




        ""We've made missteps along the way. To meet market demand, we scaled our operations too rapidly. And we overinvested in certain areas of our business,"" he said. 
    




        ""We own this. I own this. And we're holding ourselves accountable,"" he added.
    




Experts told Insider that the company fell prey to the ""bullwhip effect,"" spending big on logistics while expecting that demand would remain high  when demand cooled, Peloton was left with costly supply chain operations that now require a major overhaul. 
    




Barry McCarthy, the former chief financial officer of Spotify and Netflix, replaced Foley as CEO. In a leaked memo to employees, McCarthy called the layoffs ""a bitter pill"" but said that the company needed to accept ""the world as it is, not as we want it to be if we're going to be successful.""
    




        ""Now that the reset button has been pushed, the challenge ahead of us is this do we squander the opportunity in front of us or do we engineer the great comeback story of the post-Covid era?"" he wrote. ""I'm here for the comeback story.""
    




        Foley severed his remaining ties to the company

        July brought news of 570 additional job cuts, and in August, the company announced yet another round of layoffs, slashing roughly 800 customer-service and distribution team members  and raising prices on some equipment. 
    




        In September, Foley stepped down as executive chairman. Cofounder and Chief Legal Officer Hisao Kushi and Chief Commercial Officer Kevin Cornils also left the company.
    




        In a statement, Foley said: ""Now it is time for me to start a new professional chapter. I have passion for building companies and creating great teams, and I am excited to do that again in a new space. I am leaving the company in good hands."" Lead independent director Karen Boone took over as chair. 
    




        Then came the departure of another top executive: The New York Times' DealBook newsletter reported that Chief Marketing Officer Dara Treseder would exit the company in early October. Treseder was instrumental in helping Peloton double its membership, which has reached more than 6.9 million, a company spokesperson told DealBook.
    




        Peloton made another round of cuts in October, but McCarthy said he's 'optimistic about our future'

        McCarthy told The Wall Street Journal in October that the company would cut an additional 500 employees, many of whom work on the marketing team, in an effort to cut costs. 
    




        The report revealed that Peloton has eliminated more jobs than was previously known. About 600 additional employees have left the company since June through factors like retail store closings and attrition. That brings Peloton's total cuts this year to over 5,200. 
    




        The Journal also reported that McCarthy said the company has only six months to turn things around, which McCarthy later denied in a memo to employees published by Bloomberg. McCarthy said his comments were taken out of context and that he's never felt more optimistic about the company's future. 
    




        ""There is no ticking clock on our performance and even if there was, the business is performing well and making steady progress toward our year-end goal of break-even cash flow,"" he said. 
    




        Peloton has indeed made several changes in the past few months that could help re-energize sales: it launched its long-awaited rowing machine, started selling its gear on Amazon, and inked new deals with Dick's Sporting Goods and Hilton in hopes of attracting new customers."

1. Deal values, and volumes, slumped for the first nine months of the year. Persistently high inflation, economic uncertainty, and increased borrowing costs have made it tougher for companies to stomach debt, and many have held off from moving ahead with mergers and acquisitions.
    




        Globally, the number of M&A deals fell to 39,250 from January through September, down 18% from 48,045 in 2021, Refinitiv data showed.
    




        Cross-border deals reached 11,753 for the first nine months of 2022, down 12% from last year's 13,385 transactions. And in private-equity land, sponsor-backed buyouts fell 27% to 8,348 from 11,503, the data showed.
    




        Debt capital markets also turned bearish last quarter, and lending took a hit, according to Maria Dikeos, the head of global loan contributions for Refinitiv.
    




        US syndicated loan volumes hit $1.8 trillion for the first three quarters, down 15% year-over-year.
    




        Companies are tightening their purse strings in a bid to ride out the market volatility. Industries from big tech to Wall Street have conducted rounds of job cuts to trim their expenses, and shore up their balance sheets ahead of potentially more choppy economic conditions.
    




        To be sure, global M&A is still ahead of 2020's first three quarters  roughly $2.17 trillion worth of deals were completed during that time  and only slightly behind the $2.8 trillion in deals that were completed during the first nine months of 2019.
    




        While the slowdown is notable, it's important to remember that 2021 was a record year for M&A, capital-markets dealmaking, and private equity, which is still sitting on trillions of dollars of unused capital.

How the cloud-software startup Gusto won over investors and small businesses by breaking away from the pack,https://africa.businessinsider.com/tech-insider/how-the-cloud-software-startup-gusto-won-over-investors-and-small-businesses-by/60n7zzy,"September 22, 2022 3:53 PM",2022-10-13 03:44:25.136527,"Gusto, a software firm known for its payroll product, has grown profits alongside its customer base.Insider spoke to a Gusto cofounder and three investors about its winning strategy.This article is part ofEnterprise Tech Blueprint, a series exploring the strategies leading-edge companies use to innovate and grow.





        Joshua Reeves, the contemplative CEO of the cloud-based payroll startup Gusto, couldn't have predicted the pandemic and the resulting ripple effects that nearly savaged his business and the public markets.
    




        Shortly after the lockdowns, many of Gusto's customers, from coffee shops to florists, had to close or defer payments, and the company's revenue shrunk. ""No one had a crystal ball,"" Reeves later told Forbes.
    




        And while the events of the last three years have tested the payroll provider in countless ways, Gusto now seems to be in peak shape. A quick-thinking team has launched new products and added others through acquisitions, increasing revenue by more than 50% annually through the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a source familiar. Gusto executives declined to share total revenue.
    




        ""They have for many years demonstrated consistent high growth with a very strong business model,"" Laela Sturdy, a general partner at CapitalG and a board observer at Gusto, said. While she wouldn't comment on the timing of a possible IPO, she said that with Gusto's discipline around balancing growth and profitability, ""they'll be well-positioned when the time is right.""
    




        But for Gusto to find a warm reception on the public markets, it has to prove to potential investors it can keep up with the competition.
    




        Made for small businesses
    




        Founded in 2011, Gusto makes software that small and medium businesses use to manage their employee-related needs, including onboarding, payroll, health benefits, and retirement accounts. It runs on the cloud, so customers can collaborate with their teams and access their accounts at any time on smartphones or tablet devices.
    









Gusto grew to more than 1,400 employees in offices in Denver, San Francisco, and New York.
 6fff31bf-b3ae-40bf-b926-cf05dec9767f








        Gusto's flagship product is a payroll system geared for companies with 100 employees or fewer and counts more than 200,000 customers. That's a drop in the bucket compared to legacy payroll providers like ADP and Paychex, which, according to companystatements, have 1.6 million clients between them.
    




        Still, tools for small businesses is a huge market  one that a tech industry that has focused on the more lucrative enterprise market has largely ignored. According to the Small Business Administration, there are 32 million small businesses in the US employing about 61 million people, nearly half of the country's private workforce.
    




        Gusto's hyperfocus on small businesses sets it apart from other payroll providers, Shalini Rao, a growth-equity partner at Generation, an investment-management firm and a Gusto investor, said. As companies grow and chase larger enterprises as customers, they lose sight of the discrete needs of small businesses, she said.
    









Shalini Rao, a Gusto investor and director of growth equity at Generation, likened the company's payroll product to a Trojan horse because it's how Gusto gets into so many businesses.
 4555b3c2-5978-4f75-bbe0-11c03b9aeb9f








        Gusto now offers a suite of products and services adjacent to payroll, which Rao likened to a Trojan horse because it's how Gusto gets most of its customers. The startup hopped on pandemic-era workplace trends, adding products for small businesses to apply for government loans and for employees to access their wages between paychecks. It also helps customers register employees across state lines and pay international contractors, with the number of clients paying international contractors up twentyfold since the start of this year.
    




        ""From a product perspective, we're here alongside businesses as they swerve with every curve that comes at them, helping them thrive and ultimately grow. And when they grow, so does Gusto,"" Eddie Kim, a Gusto cofounder and the company's chief technology officer, said.
    




        Gusto has also expanded through strategic acquisitions. Last year, it bought three companies across the tax compliance and remote work spaces  Ardius, Symmetry, and Remote Team  and it's indicated that those firms will continue to run independently. And Noyo, a startup designed to automate employee benefits, recently raised $45 million in funding from investors like Norwest and Gusto, which uses Noyo.
    




        In this way, Gusto aims to be the scaffolding of the HR-tech stack, with services bolted on through acquisition and investment.
    




        ""We spent a lot of time and energy on building out our own internal-development capabilities. That has to be the foundation,"" Jason Green, a founding partner of Emergence Capital and a board observer at Gusto, said. ""But then there were some interesting opportunities that came up that were adjacent but not necessarily ones that we would have wanted to distract ourselves internally.""
    









Nearly half of Gusto's workforce clocks in from home, while 30% of senior leadership is fully remote.
 6fff31bf-b3ae-40bf-b926-cf05dec9767f








        Gusto has ruthlessly prioritized areas like payroll and tax-filing that small businesses need to run. But from the beginning, Gusto has ""thought carefully"" about not just the employers buying its software, but about the employees using it, Sturdy said. It offers retirement accounts and budgeting tools to help employees ""live a better life,"" she said. And it could still tap into more consumer-focused products for employees, a massive category on its own, she said.
    




        Setting a course for an IPO
    




        Gusto has deep coffers  and a new chief financial officer from GitHub and Tesla  to go after its growth ambitions. It has raised nearly $700 million in total funding, according to PitchBook data, and hit a valuation of $9.5 billion in 2021. For comparison, Gusto's closest competitor, Rippling, also has $700 million in funding but is valued at $11.25 billion. The startup  Parker Conrad's second act after his previous firm, Zenefits, blew up  booked over $100 million in annual recurring revenue, according to a Forbes report.
    




        For years, Reeves has said that selling Gusto is out of the question. He intends to take the firm public. Now it's a matter of timing. The window for tech firms to go public slammed shut this year. For instance, another large payroll provider, Justworks, withdrew its IPO filing in July.
    




        But Gusto has years of runway and can afford to wait for market conditions to improve, Green, an early Gusto investor, said.
    




        ""I don't see any cap to the upside in terms of the market potential for the business, and you've got a team that maybe by the time this company goes public has got 15 years of excellence,"" he said. ""Public-market investors  when they move from fear to greed again  will find this to be a pretty unique asset and opportunity."""
Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Reminds Investors of Looming Deadline in the Class Action Lawsuit Against MINISO Group Holding Limited (MNSO),https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/10/12/2533221/34548/en/Glancy-Prongay-Murray-LLP-Reminds-Investors-of-Looming-Deadline-in-the-Class-Action-Lawsuit-Against-MINISO-Group-Holding-Limited-MNSO.html,"October 12, 2022 12:00 ET",2022-10-13 03:43:37.157582,"LOS ANGELES, Oct.  12, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP (“GPM”) reminds investors of the upcoming October 17, 2022 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired MINISO Group Holding Limited (“MINISO” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MNSO) securities pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement and prospectus (collectively, the “Registration Statement”) issued in connection with the Company’s October 2020 initial public offering (the “IPO” or “Offering”).  If you suffered a loss on your MINISO investments or would like to inquire about potentially pursuing claims to recover your loss under the federal securities laws, you can submit your contact information at www.glancylaw.com/cases/miniso-group-holding-limited/. You can also contact Charles H. Linehan, of GPM at 310-201-9150, Toll-Free at 888-773-9224, or via email at shareholders@glancylaw.com to learn more about your rights.  On October 15, 2020, MINISO conducted its IPO, issuing approximately 30.4 million American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) at $20.00 per ADS.  On July 26, 2022, Blue Orca Capital published a report alleging, among other things, that MINISO “lies about its core business model” by claiming that 99% of its stores in China are operated by independent franchises. However, an investigation shows that over 620 supposedly independent franchises are registered under the names of MINISO executives or individuals “closely connected” to the Company’s chairman.

INTRODUCTION  1.1 Taylor Maritime Investments Limited (“TMI”), and Grindrod Shipping Holdings Ltd.

NASDAQ  (1) Grindrod Shipping share price quoted on the NASDAQ based on data extracted from Bloomberg L.P. as at the Last Trading Day or Disclosure Date (as appropriate), rounded to the nearest two decimal places.  (2) The percentage figures are rounded to the nearest one decimal place.  JSE   Notes:  (1) Grindrod Shipping share price quoted on the JSE based on data extracted from Bloomberg L.P. as at the Last Trading Day or Disclosure Date (as appropriate), rounded to the nearest two decimal places.  (2) Based on the rate extracted from Bloomberg L.P. as at the Last Trading Day or Disclosure Date (as appropriate), rounded to the nearest two decimal places.  (3) The ZAR price is converted to USD at the rate prevailing on the relevant day or, in the case of the VWAP, the average rate prevailing during the relevant period.  (4) The percentage figures are rounded to the nearest one decimal place.  2.3 Background to and reasons for the Offer  (a) Background to the Offer  The Offeror, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TMI, first acquired shares in the Company in Q4 2021. Through additional purchases in Q4 2021 the Offeror established an approximately 26% ownership position in the Company and designated Paul Charles Over to serve on the Company’s board of directors. On 25 August 2022, TMI delivered to Grindrod a non-binding indicative proposal to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company not already owned by Offeror through the Proposed Transaction.  (b) Rationale for, and benefits of, the acquisition  Strategic shareholder consolidating ownership position through premium, all cash Offer   The aggregate value of $26.00 per Grindrod Share represents (i) a 26.8% premium to the price per Grindrod Share of US$20.50 on 26 August 2022 being the last traded price per Grindrod Share on the NASDAQ on 26 August 2022 and (ii) a 20.2% premium to the 90-day volume weighted average price of US$22.66 per Grindrod Share prior to the Disclosure Date. The Company’s stock average daily trading volume on the NASDAQ of $7.3m during the 90-day period prior to 26 August 2022 represents 1.4% of the Offer’s $506.3m valuation of the Company being traded each day. The Offer is conditional upon, among other conditions, the Minimum Condition, namely the Offeror owning more than 50.0% of the shares carrying voting rights of the Company.  Certainty of a premium, cash exit for Grindrod investors  The Offer in cash provides an immediate and certain exit opportunity for Grindrod Shareholders at an attractive premium to Grindrod’s undisturbed share price at a time of significant market volatility and economic uncertainty.  Strategic combination creates a significant market player in the mid-sized dry-bulk industry with a combined fleet of 582 vessels  TMI believes the Offer will create a significant player and owner of mid-sized dry-bulk ships. Together TMI and Grindrod own a fleet of 58 geared vessels (including 6 chartered-in ships, 4 of which have purchase options), providing freight capacity to a high-quality customer base and moving a diversified portfolio of cargoes around the world.  TMI believes complementary fleets have the potential to generate defensive earnings and sustainable dividends, improving average vessel age and carbon intensity.  Scale and global operations to unlock additional revenue and operational cost savings  TMI believes the combination of TMI and the Company would enable the Enlarged Group’s chartering and technical management functions to realise additional value through the enhanced scale and utilization of the combined fleet and charter book. The combined fleet will mean that the Enlarged Group’s assets are closer to its customers around the world, enabling TMI and Grindrod’s experienced chartering teams to create additional value through positioning advantages, and the technical teams to make economic, bulk purchases of spares. The Enlarged Group is expected by TMI to achieve enhanced realised revenue and cost unit economics that are not available to either TMI or Grindrod on a standalone basis.  Conservative business model and capital structure to deliver liquidity and free cash generation  TMI expects that the Enlarged Group will maintain a conservative long-term capital structure. In order to fund the Offer, TMI has arranged an acquisition facility. At 100% acceptances, TMI will exceptionally increase its debt to gross assets ratio to 40% and is committed to reducing this to no more than 25% within 18 months, with the new facility significantly reduced or eliminated within that timeframe.  TMI intends to continue to implement its strategy of employing its ships primarily on period time-charters, utilizing a mix of duration, including short term Charters (less than 6 months), medium term Charters (more than 6 months) and long-term Charters (greater than a year) which are expected to benefit from staggered renewals of an even larger fleet, with a view to flattening the income curve.  The combined fleet is expected by TMI to generate robust free cash flow, which, together with proceeds from vessel sales, as part of overall fleet renewal strategy, will be used to repay debt.  Resilient and flexible business model  TMI expects the Enlarged Group should benefit from enhanced resilience and improved market access to face potentially more difficult macro environments and in the face of future incoming shipping regulations relating to the environment.  3. TERMS OF THE OFFER  3.1 Terms of the Offer. In accordance with Section 139 of the Securities and Futures Act 2001 of Singapore, the Code, and Regulations 14D and 14E of the SEC promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act (subject to the SEC No-Action Relief),and subject to the terms and conditions to be set out in the formal offer documentation to be issued in respect of the Offer (the “Offer to Purchase”), the Offer will be made on the following basis:  (a) Offer Shares.

For the avoidance of doubt, no reduction of the Offer Price is contemplated by this paragraph 3.2 in respect of the declaration or payment of the Special Dividend or any Permitted Dividend.  3.3 Adjustment for alterations to capital. If, any time on or after the Offer Announcement Date and the end of the Subsequent Offering Period, any change in the outstanding Shares occurs as a result of any share split (including a reverse share split), subdivision or combination, any share dividend or share distribution with a record date during such period, the Offeror reserves the right to equitably adjust the Offer Price to reflect such change and provide the holders of each Share the same economic effect as contemplated hereunder prior to such event.  3.4 Jurisdictions. The Offer will be made in accordance with Regulations 14D and 14E of the SEC promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act (subject to the SEC No-Action Relief) and the Code (subject to the SIC Rulings) as a single offer concurrently in the United States of America, South Africa, Singapore and other jurisdictions to which the Offer may be legally extended.  3.5 Offer Conditional.

In respect of such Outstanding Awards:  (a) if the consent of the relevant FSA Holder to the cancellation of all his or her Outstanding Awards so vested has been obtained, such FSA Holder shall be entitled, in consideration of such cancellation, to receive payment of US$21.00 (in lieu of the Offer Price) in respect of each Share which would have accrued on the Outstanding Awards held by such FSA Holder, using cash provided by the Offeror (each such payment, an “FSA Payment” and the aggregate of all such FSA Payments, the “Aggregate FSA Payment”);  (b) if the consent of the relevant FSA Holder to the cancellation of all his Outstanding Awards so vested has not been obtained, such FSA Holder shall be entitled to be issued such number of Shares accruing to such Outstanding Awards, with such Shares to be delivered by the Company to such holder as promptly as practicable after the Acceptance Time; and  (c) subject to the occurrence of the Acceptance Time, each FSA Holder shall receive payment of US$5.00 (in lieu of the Special Dividend) (the “Special Dividend Equivalent Payment”) in respect of each Share which would have accrued on the Outstanding Awards held by such FSA Holder as at the Dividend Record Date, using cash provided by the Company.  6.3 Following payment by the Offeror to the Company of an amount equivalent to the Aggregate FSA Payment, the Company will promptly issue to the Offeror, such number of Shares obtained by dividing the Aggregate FSA Payment by the Offer Price.  6.4 Each FSA Payment and Special Dividend Equivalent Payment will be made by the Company no later than the first payroll date immediately following the Acceptance Time, and TMI, the Offeror and the Company shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from each such FSA Payment or Dividend Equivalent Payment, any amounts required to be deducted or withheld under applicable tax laws.  7. INFORMATION ON TMI AND THE OFFEROR  Information on TMI  7.1 TMI is an internally managed shipping company listed on the Premium Segment of the Official List, its shares trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange since May 2021 (the IPO).  TMI specialises in the acquisition and chartering of vessels in the Handysize and Supramax bulk carrier segments of the global shipping sector.  TMI invests in a diversified portfolio of vessels which are primarily second-hand and which, historically, have earned returns in excess of the Company's target dividend yield of 8% p.a. (on the initial issue price).  The current portfolio numbers 27 vessels in the geared dry bulk segment (Handysize and Supramax types).  The ships are employed utilising a variety of employment/charter strategies.  7.2 TMI pursues a progressive dividend policy. It announced an increased interim dividend of 2 cents per Ordinary Share paid on a quarterly basis on 28 July 2022, with a targeted total NAV return of 10-12% per annum over the medium to long-term. The Board of TMI declared a special dividend of 3.22 cents per share in respect of the period from IPO to 31 March 2022 paid on 6 May 2022, which brought total dividends declared for the period from IPO to 31 March 2022 to 8.47 US cents per share, representing a dividend yield on the IPO price of approximately 10% on an annualised basis.  7.3 TMI has the benefit of an experienced Executive Team led by Edward Buttery and who previously worked closely together at the Commercial Manager, Taylor Maritime.  Established in 2014, Taylor Maritime is a privately owned ship-owning and management business with a seasoned team that includes the founders of dry bulk shipping company Pacific Basin Shipping (listed in Hong Kong 2343.HK) and gas shipping company BW Epic Kosan (formerly Epic Shipping) (listed in Oslo BWEK:NO).  Taylor Maritime's team of industry professionals are based in Guernsey, Singapore and London.  7.4 TMI believes the Proposed Transaction represents an exciting opportunity to combine Grindrod's operations with TMI to create a significant owner of Handysize up to Ultramax dry cargo ships.  TMI believes the complementary nature of the respective companies' fleets and enhanced operational scale in the geared dry-bulk sector should create meaningful additional value for TMI Shareholders and customers that each of the companies serve. Further details of the benefits of the Transaction are set out below under “Rationale for, and benefits of, the acquisition”.  Information on the Offeror  The Offeror is wholly-owned subsidiary of TMI which is incorporated in the Marshall Islands and whose principal business is to hold investments on behalf of the TMI group.

BACKGROUND TO AND REASONS FOR THE OFFER  (a) Background to the Offer  The Offeror, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TMI, first acquired shares in the Company in Q4 2021. Through additional purchases in Q4 2021 the Offeror established a 26% ownership position in the Company and designated Paul Charles Over to serve on the Company board of directors. On 25 August 2022, TMI delivered to the Company a non-binding indicative proposal to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company not already owned by Offeror through the Proposed Transaction.  (b) Rationale for, and benefits of, the acquisition  Strategic shareholder consolidating ownership position through premium, all cash Offer   The aggregate value of $26.00 per Grindrod Share represents (i) a 26.8% premium to the price per Grindrod Share of US$20.50 on 26 August 2022 being the last traded price per Grindrod Share on the NASDAQ on 26 August 2022 and (ii) a 20.2% premium to the 90-day volume weighted average price of US$22.66 per Grindrod Share prior to the Disclosure Date. The Company’s stock average daily trading volume on the NASDAQ of $7.3m during the 90-day period prior to 26 August 2022 represents 1.4% of the Offer’s $506.3m valuation of the Company being traded each day. The Offer is conditional upon, among other conditions, the Minimum Condition, namely the Offeror owning more than 50.0% of the shares carrying voting rights of the Company.  Certainty of a premium, cash exit for Grindrod investors  The Offer in cash provides an immediate and certain exit opportunity for Grindrod Shareholders at an attractive premium to Grindrod’s undisturbed share price at a time of significant market volatility and economic uncertainty.  Strategic combination creates a significant market player in the mid-sized dry-bulk industry with a fleet of 58 vessels  TMI believes the Offer will create a significant player and owner of mid-sized dry-bulk ships. Together TMI and Grindrod own a fleet of 58 geared vessels (including 6 chartered-in ships, 4 of which have purchase options), providing freight capacity to a high-quality customer base and moving a diversified portfolio of cargoes around the world.  TMI believes complementary fleets have the potential to generate defensive earnings and sustainable dividends, improving average vessel age and carbon intensity.  Scale and global operations to unlock additional revenue and operational cost savings  TMI believes the combination of TMI and the Company would enable the Enlarged Group’s chartering and technical management functions to realise additional value through the enhanced scale and utilization of the combined fleet and charter book. TMI believes the combined fleet will mean that the Enlarged Group’s assets are closer to its customers around the world, enabling TMI and Grindrod’s experienced chartering teams to create additional value through positioning advantages, and the technical teams to make economic, bulk purchases of spares. TMI expects the Enlarged Group to achieve enhanced realised revenue and cost unit economics that are not available to either TMI or Grindrod on a standalone basis.  Conservative business model and capital structure to deliver liquidity and free cash generation  TMI expects that the Enlarged Group will maintain a conservative long-term capital structure. In order to fund the Offer, TMI has arranged an acquisition facility. At 100% acceptances, TMI will exceptionally increase its debt to gross assets ratio to 40% and is committed to reducing this to no more than 25% within 18 months, with the new facility significantly reduced or eliminated within that timeframe.  TMI intends to continue to implement its strategy of employing its ships primarily on period time-charters, utilizing a mix of duration including short term Charters (less than 6 months), medium term Charters (more than 6 months) and long-term Charters (greater than a year) which are expected to benefit from staggered renewals of an even larger fleet, with a view to flattening the income curve.  TMI expects the combined fleet to generate robust free cash flow, which, together with proceeds from vessel sales, as part of overall fleet renewal strategy, are expected to be used by TMI to repay debt.  Resilient and flexible business model  TMI expects the Enlarged Group should benefit from enhanced resilience and improved market access to face potentially more difficult macro environments and in the face of future incoming shipping regulations relating to the environment.  11.

TMI SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL  12.1 The Offer is subject to the approval of TMI’s shareholders in respect of a proposed amendment to TMI’s existing investment policy (the “Investment Policy Amendment”). The Investment Policy Amendment would increase TMI’s maximum aggregate borrowing limit to 40% of gross asset value for acquisition financing, reducing to no more than 25% within 18 months, and would allow for the acquisition of a shipping company with a single investment restriction of 40% of gross asset value reducing to below 30% within 18 months.  12.2 The Investment Policy Amendment is considered to constitute a material change to the Company’s published Investment Policy. Therefore, pursuant to LR 15.4.8(2) of the Listing Rules of the FCA, TMI is required to obtain the approval of TMI Shareholders by way of an ordinary resolution, which requires the approval of a simple majority of the TMI Shareholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting (the “Resolution”). The FCA has given its prior approval to the proposed amendments.  12.3 With regard to the Investment Policy Amendment Condition, as at the Offer Announcement Date, the directors of TMI have undertaken to vote in favour of the Resolution in respect of their own beneficial holdings, which amount in aggregate to 3,618,476 ordinary TMI shares and represent approximately 1.1 per cent of TMI’s issued share capital as at11 October 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to the Offer Announcement Date).  12.4 Undertakings to vote in favour of the Resolution have also been received from certain other TMI Shareholders, which amount in aggregate to 41,946,549 TMI ordinary shares and represent approximately 12.7 per cent of TMI's issued share capital as at 11 October 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to the Offer Announcement Date).  12.5 Letters of intent to vote in favour of the Resolution have also been received from certain other TMI Shareholders, which amount in aggregate to 78,606,747 TMI ordinary shares and represent approximately 23.8 per cent of TMI's issued share capital as at 11 October 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to the Offer Announcement Date).  12.6 Undertakings and letters of in intent to vote in favour of the Resolution have therefore been received in respect of 124,171,772 TMI ordinary shares in aggregate, representing approximately 37.6 per cent of TMI's issued share capital in total as at 11 October 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to the Offer Announcement Date).  13.

Ltd.(“Evercore”), as financial adviser to the Offeror in connection with the Offer, confirms that sufficient financial resources are available to the Offeror to satisfy in full all acceptances of the Offer for the Offer Shares in cash on the basis of the Offer Price.  14. GRINDROD BOARD RECOMMENDATION   The Independent Company Directors have been advised by Provenance Capital Pte. Ltd. (the “IFA”) in connection with the financial terms of the Offer. Subject to the opinion of the IFA to be issued to the Independent Company Directors (and to be disclosed to the Grindrod Shareholders in the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed by Grindrod to the Grindrod Shareholders) (the “Company Circular”) on whether the financial terms of the Offer are fair and reasonable, the Independent Company Directors preliminarily recommend that the Grindrod Shareholders accept the Offer.  Grindrod Shareholders are advised not to take any action in relation to the Offer until Grindrod Shareholders have carefully considered (a) the Independent Company Directors’ formal recommendation to Shareholders in relation to the Offer in the Company Circular, (b) the advice of the IFA to be disclosed in the Company Circular, and (c) the intentions of the Offeror (where regard should also be had to paragraph 16 (Compulsory Acquisition) and paragraph 17(Listing Status) hereof), to be set out in the offer document referred to in paragraph 18.  15. DISCLOSURES ON HOLDINGS AND DEALINGS IN RELEVANT SECURITIES  15.1 As at the Offer Announcement Date, the Offeror and parties acting in concert with it own or control in aggregate 4,925,023 Shares, representing approximately 25.93% of all the Shares, details of which are set out in Schedule 2.  15.2 Save as disclosed in this Announcement (in particular Schedule 2 and Schedule 3), and based on the latest information available to the Offeror, neither the Offeror nor parties acting in concert with it:  (a) owns, controls or has agreed to acquire any:  (i) Shares;  (ii) securities which carry voting rights in the Company; and  (iii) convertible securities, warrants, options or derivatives in respect of such Shares or securities,         (collectively, the “Company Securities”);  (b) has received any irrevocable undertakings from any party to accept or reject the Offer;  (c) has dealt for value in any Company Securities during the period commencing three months preceding 29 August 2022 and ending on the Offer Announcement Date;  (d) has entered into any arrangement (whether by way of option, indemnity or otherwise) in relation to the Shares which might be material to the Offer; or  (e) has in respect of the Company Securities:  (i) granted a security interest over any Company Securities to another person, whether through a charge, pledge or otherwise;  (ii) borrowed from another person any Company Securities (excluding borrowed Company Securities which have been on-lent or sold); or  (iii) lent any Company Securities to another person.  16. COMPULSORY ACQUISITION   16.1 Pursuant to Section 215(1) of the Companies Act, if the Offeror acquires not less than 90% of the total issued Shares as at the date of the Offer (other than those already held by the Offeror, its related corporations or their respective nominees as at the date of the Offer and which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes any Shares held by the Company in treasury) (the “Compulsory Acquisition Threshold”) within four months after the date of the Offer, the Offeror will be entitled to exercise its rights under Section 215(1) of the Companies Act to compulsorily acquire all the Offer Shares of the Grindrod Shareholders who have not accepted the Offer on the same terms as the Offer.  In such event, the Offeror intends to exercise its right to compulsorily acquire all the Offer Shares of the Grindrod Shareholders who have not accepted the Offer. The Offeror will then proceed to delist the Company from the JSE and NASDAQ and terminate the registration of the Shares with the SEC.  16.2 Pursuant to Section 215(3) of the Companies Act, if the Offeror acquires such number of Offer Shares which, together with Shares held by it, its related corporations and their respective nominees, comprise 90% or more of the total issued Shares, the Grindrod Shareholders who have not accepted the Offer have a right to require the Offeror to acquire their Shares at the Offer Price. Such Grindrod Shareholders who wish to exercise such right are advised to seek their own independent legal advice.  17. LISTING STATUS   Nasdaq  17.1 Depending upon the number of Shares purchased by the Offeror pursuant to the Offer, the Shares may no longer meet the requirements of NASDAQ for continued listing and may be delisted from NASDAQ. According to NASDAQ’s published guidelines, NASDAQ would consider delisting the Shares if, among other things: (i) the number of Shares publicly held falls below 750,000; (ii) the number of holders (including both holders of beneficial interest and holders of record) of Shares falls below 400; or (iii) the market value of such publicly-held Shares is not at least US $5,000,000.  17.2 In addition, following the consummation of the Offer, if NASDAQ does not initiate delisting procedures on its own, the Offeror may decide to cause the Company to voluntarily delist the Shares from NASDAQ, depending upon the number of Shares purchased by the Offeror pursuant to the Offer and the number of holders of the Shares. If the Offeror acquires such number of Offer Shares which, together with Shares held by it, its related corporations and their respective nominees, comprise 90% or more of the total issued Shares within four months after the date of the Offer and the Offeror exercises its rights under Section 215(1) of the Companies Act to compulsorily acquire all the Offer Shares of the Grindrod Shareholders who have not accepted the Offer, the Offeror intends to cause the Company to voluntarily delist the Shares from NASDAQ.  17.3 Registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act, may be terminated upon notice to the SEC if the Shares are neither listed on a national securities exchange in the U.S. nor held by 300 or more holders of record. Termination of such registration of the Shares would substantially reduce the information required to be furnished by the Company to its shareholders and to the SEC and would make certain provisions of such Act no longer applicable to the Company, such as the requirement of furnishing an annual report on Form 20-F to shareholders and the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under such Act with respect to “going private” transactions.  17.4 Grindrod Shareholders should note that the Offeror may seek to delist from NASDAQ and terminate the Company’s registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act in circumstances where the 90% Compulsory Acquisition Threshold is not met, subject to satisfying applicable legal and regulatory requirements (including any requirements imposed by NASDAQ and/or the SEC) at the relevant time.  JSE  17.5 In a scenario where the Offeror exercises its right to compulsorily acquire and acquires or agrees to acquire all of the Offer Shares (in the circumstances contemplated in paragraph 17.1), the Offeror intends to procure that the Company will make an application for the cancellation of the listing of its securities on the List maintained by the JSE and for the cancellation of the admission to trading of the Company’s securities on the Main Board of the JSE.  17.6 It is anticipated that the application for cancellation of the listing on the List maintained by the JSE and the admission to trading on the Main Board of the JSE will take effect no earlier than the commencement of business on the JSE on the date that is 30 JSE Business Days after the publication by the Offeror of an announcement that it is invoking its right to compulsorily acquire all of the Offer Shares.  17.7 Grindrod Shareholders should note that the Offeror may also seek to delist from the JSE in circumstances where the 90% Compulsory Acquisition Threshold is not met, subject to satisfying applicable legal and regulatory requirements (including any requirements imposed by the JSE and/or the South African Reserve Bank) at the relevant time.  17.8 Delisting of the Shares from NASDAQ and the cancellation of the listing on the List maintained by the JSE would significantly reduce the liquidity and marketability of the Shares. Delisting of the Shares from the JSE would significantly reduce the liquidity and marketability of the Shares held on the South African register.   18. OFFER DOCUMENT  18.1 Further information on the Offer will be set out in an Offer to Purchase and related documents to be mailed to the Grindrod Shareholders. The Offer to Purchase, which will contain the terms and conditions of the Offer, and enclose the appropriate form(s) of acceptance, will be despatched to Grindrod Shareholders no earlier than 14 days and no later than 21 days from the Offer Announcement Date. The Offer will remain open for acceptances by Grindrod Shareholders for a period of at least 20 U.S. business days, or 28 days from the date of mailing of the Offer to Purchase, whichever the longer.  18.2 In the meantime, Grindrod Shareholders are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the Shares.  19. GRINDROD SHAREHOLDERS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS  The availability of the Offer to persons not resident in the United States of America, South Africa, the United Kingdom, or Singapore maybe affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. Grindrod Shareholders of the Company who are not resident in the United States of America, South Africa, the United Kingdom, or Singapore should inform themselves about, and observe, any applicable requirements in their own jurisdiction.

Two Major Kazakh National Companies to Undergo IPO This Year,https://astanatimes.com/2022/02/two-major-kazakh-national-companies-to-undergo-ipo-this-year/,16 February 2022,2022-10-13 03:39:15.125943,"
NUR-SULTAN – Kazakhstan’s national airline Air Astana and the KazMunayGas (KMG) oil and gas company, whose major shareholder is the Samruk Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund, will go public this year, said Yernar Zhanadil, Samruk Kazyna Managing Director for Privatization and Development, in an interview with the Deputy Chair of Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE)  – Andrey Tsaluk on Instagram live.

The listing of both companies was planned several years ago and has been delayed since then due to external factors, said Zhanadil. Speaking about Air Astana, he said that the “COVID-19 pandemic strongly affected the market of air travel.” 
“As the market declined, we decided to wait, especially because airlines had to urgently address their anti-crisis plan,” he said. 
Many airlines either went bankrupt or received a subsidy from the governments during the pandemic, according to Zhanadil. He said that Air Astana did not receive any financial support and yet it was able to overcome the crisis. The company shows good results, mainly due to the high demand for its low-cost airline – Fly Arystan.
Regarding KMG, Zhanadil said that Samruk Kazyna previously decided to postpone the IPO due to the drop in oil prices in March 2020. Despite all the preparations made for a successful listing, “it made no sense at that time to launch an IPO,” he said.
Air Astana and KMG will undergo public listing both at the local stock market and in one of the international exchanges. The major reasons why the two companies will list abroad are ensuring the right market price for the stock and liquidity. Kazakhstan’s local stock market does not have a sufficient volume of trading and needs to catch up with international markets. Another reason is that many international companies have their own regulations that might not satisfy the local ones.
“Taking into account the large size of the companies it is necessary to consider their commercial interests… Exclusive placement on the local markets could lead to the lower selling price of shares, even when there is a significant demand from international investors, who could offer a price that is higher than ours,” said Zhanadil.
The IPO of national companies will be accessible to the public and at least 20 percent of shares will be listed at KASE or/and AIX (Astana International Exchange). 
Tsaluk also asked about plans for the implementation of the privatization plan that was approved for 2021-2025. Zhanadil said that the government privatization plan includes 25 assets of the fund, eight of them large companies and 17 smaller assets. Each of those companies has multiple subsidiaries, which makes around 180 companies eligible for privatization.
Among the large companies, Zhanadil mentioned the KazPost national post company, Samruk Energy, and the Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ) national railway company.
Investors in the energy sector are focused on the principle of environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy investment. Samruk Energy has the facilities to generate more than six gigawatts of electricity, but most of it is generated from coal. Therefore, the company needs to increase its green assets portfolio to be in demand at the IPO, said Zhanadil, adding that they plan an IPO in 2023-2024.
KazPost was supposed to be privatized through a direct targeted sale to a strategic investor back in 2021. “We did work through an open two-stage tender, but unfortunately the price offered did not satisfy the fund. As a result, we came up with a proposal to the government to postpone the sale for two more years. During that time, we will begin strategic initiatives to improve the company’s operating activities, so that it would increase the value of the company,” said Zhanadil.
As for KTZ, Zhanadil said that the company has to resolve the issues related to its large infrastructure assets, large debt burden, and the issue of tariff setting before applying for a listing. It will not be ready for IPO by 2023, he added.

Kazakhstan may postpone national railway IPO,https://astanatimes.com/2018/12/kazakhstan-may-postpone-national-railway-ipo/,12 December 2018,2022-10-13 03:39:15.778303,"
ASTANA – Postponing Kazakhstan Temir Zholy’s (KTZ) initial public offering (IPO) until 2025 has been requested on behalf of the National Association of Mining and Mining and Metallurgical Enterprises and the Kazakh Union of Manufacturers and Exporters.

“The Kazakh Ministry of National Economy is now considering IPO launches in the next year or two, which we all know will be a growth multiplier,” said National Association of Mining and Mining and Metallurgical Enterprises Executive Director and Kazakh Union of Manufacturers and Exporters President Nikolay Radostovets at a meeting with Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev.
National companies KazMunayGas (KMG), Kazpost, KTZ and Samruk Energy plan to go public in 2019-2020, according to Minister of National Economy Timur Suleimenov. Kazatomprom, the first national company to launch on an international stock exchange, placed 15 percent of its $451 million shares on the London Stock Exchange Nov. 13.
“We ask for the postponing of KTZ’s IPO launch until 2025 because it is a backbone structure that is very important for us [manufacturers],” he added.
Based in the capital, KTZ develops, operates and maintains railway transportation domestically and internationally. One hundred percent of its shares are owned by Samruk Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund. According to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recommendations, the decision to privatise will reduce the state’s share in the economy, which should make the company more competitive and efficient.
“A new KTZ head has recently been appointed,” noted Sagintayev, referring to Sauat Mynbayev’s Nov. 20 naming. “He will put forth proposals, which we will then discuss.”
Mynbayev, a Lomonosov Moscow State University graduate, has served as KMG chairperson since 2013. His previously was vice minister of finance (1995), ministry of finance treasury head (1997), first vice minister of finance (1997-1998), minister of finance (1998-1999), President’s Executive Office deputy head (1999) minister of agriculture (1999-2001), Kazakh Development Bank chairperson (2001-2002), Caspian Industrial & Financial Group general director (2002-2003), vice prime minister (2003-2004), minister of industry and trade (2004-2006), Samruk Kazyna chairperson (2006-2007), minister of energy and natural resources (2007) and minister of oil and gas (2010-2013). He assumed Kanat Alpysbayev’s post, who has been KTZ chairperson since 2016 and was appointed Dec. 4 as Samruk Kazyna managing director for transport and logistics.

Expert consults citizens on IPO investments as privatisation advances,https://astanatimes.com/2017/02/expert-consults-citizens-on-ipo-investments-as-privatisation-advances/,22 February 2017,2022-10-13 03:39:16.084952,"
ASTANA – Forex Club information and analysis centre head Nikolai Ivchenko has advised citizens to invest funds intelligently when purchasing national companies’ shares at initial public offerings (IPOs), specifically, not to spend all their money on one particular company no matter how stable they are.

“It is hard to talk about issuers; we need to analyse each company individually. Typically, an IPO is not a simple process. Commonly, after the start of an IPO a company’s shares fall in price; however, they start recovering later. Therefore, individuals are recommended not to invest all their money in one or two companies. One can invest 20 percent of the savings in an IPO. Of course, if one sees any segment in the stock market as one of the areas for investment, it is better to spend 10 percent of the savings for an IPO and divide five percent of the investment on each company. The rest of the money can be invested in a long-trading company by buying an index or a basket consisting of 15-20 companies which are included in the index. It is always easier to deal with a reliable asset that has long been trading in the market,” he said, according to inform.kz.
Ivchenko reiterated any IPO carries risks of a sharp rise or decline.
“In general, I can say that the Kazakhstan Stock Market (KASE) will witness positive dynamics in the next two years,” he added.
In a recent address to the nation, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev outlined aspects of further stock market development. He noted the necessity of expanding opportunities for people to invest their savings primarily in various types of stocks. The President instructed the government together with the National Bank to take adequate measures aimed at enhancing the domestic stock market.
The Samruk Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund intends to transfer 23 assets to the competitive environment through IPO this year, said Samruk Kazyna head Umirzak Shukeyev.
“According to our plan for this year, 23 facilities out of 45 in the first list will be sold until the end of 2017,” he added.
From this list, 12 assets will be prepared for IPO in the first half of the year. The world’s largest companies will be invited to participate in the privatisation plan.
“We plan to prepare Air Astana and Kazatomprom for IPO this year,” said Shukeyev.
Prime Minister Bakhytzhan Sagintayev recently instructed the Ministry of Finance to accelerate and complete privatising enterprises.
“The government is supposed to complete the corresponding work before the end of 2018. The Ministry of National Economy is required to submit the government’s draft decision on the approval of a specific list of projects subject to privatisation until 2018,” he added.

NUR-SULTAN – As part of the 2019 Astana Finance Days, the Astana International Financial Centre’s (AIFC) Bureau for Continuing Professional Development (BCPD) organised Getting Trained for IPO (Initial Public Offering) seminars July 1 for Kazakh companies which are considering entering international capital markets and attracting foreign investments. The meetings involved approximately 50 companies.

“Within the first half of this year, we have been working very closely with investment projects, enterprises and firms. We asked them what kind of needs they have. They all need investments to expand their capacity… From the other side, we were on board with a few large institutional investors to the AIFC… It’s good – we have investors who want to invest and projects that need them. But in this half year, we realised that there is a gap in projects’ investability – what the projects are and what investors want,” AIFC Deputy Board Chair Yernur Rysmagambetov told The Astana Times.

To close the gap, the AIFC team developed a series of workshops for companies willing to venture into the international market, attract foreign investments and launch an IPO.
“We decided to take a proactive approach and initiate a series of workshops and trainings to educate these projects’ holders and companies on what kind of things they need to have to make their companies investable, to attract foreign investors and, the grand goal, to do an IPO,” he added.
To help companies reach their goals, AIFC promotes the idea of educating their staffs to meet international standards and properly and professionally execute all stages of IPO preparation.
“Doing an IPO is hard, but actually being a public company is even harder, because you need to react faster and have an internationally certified staff. Once you have engaged in any performance of investment agreement as a foreign investor, you have certain liabilities. We felt like most of the companies in Central Asia and Kazakhstan are not ready… to be in such environment,” he said.
In the last two years, BCPD has created professional development programmes for accountants, financial analysts, investment managers and risk managers and in human resources, corporate governance and English common law. The organisation is now planning to gather the courses into a single training, the first step of which is Getting Trained for IPO. The next step is to select companies which will continue working with AIFC in September, further educating their staff and expanding their capacity.
“What we are trying to do right now is combine all these programmes into one single large programme which we call Getting Trained for IPO… and work with the companies which are seriously willing to attract foreign investors, want to teach their staff first and upgrade their company… If you are thinking about going international, we are promoting the idea of investing in your own staff and capacity and then going to international markets,” said Rysmagambetov.
Leading experts in key competence areas with international certifications in investment management, risk management, accounting and auditing and personnel management attended the event. The speakers examined practical aspects such as corporate governance, legal support and building relations with investors before, during and after the IPO.

Akshu Campbell-Holt, AIFC Authority senior adviser, spoke about corporate management in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. She noted “the key factors surviving it are environment, social and governance (ESG) investments” that outperformed “traditional investments” in the last several years.
“Companies that have integrated robust ESG practices have displayed lower cost of capital, lower volatility and even fewer instances of bribery, fraud and corruption. These are what we’d like to see as stakeholders of a company,” she said.
“I believe that sustainability is a strong contender to become a new norm in making investment decisions in general,” she added.

Alexander Van de Putte, AIFC Academic Council chair and Governor’s Council Chief Strategy Officer, moderated the workshop. He talked about the importance of diversity in company structure, particularly in gender, age, ethnicity and most importantly mindset that directly influence decision making in the company. He also showed a timetable presenting the method of implementing corporate governance in pre-IPO companies.
In the first half of the training, participants learned about the audit and governance needs of small and medium businesses from Vikas Aggarwal, Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) regional head of Policy for Emerging Markets; investor relations from AIFC chief private banking officer Heiner Hartwich; human resources, particularly long term motivation strategies of top managers during IPO preparation, from Korn Ferry senior consultant Irina Chernozubova, and IPO regulations, particularly preparing a prospectus for investors to familiarise themselves with companies where they want to invest, from Semion Issyk, a lawyer with Zan Hub.

"Kazakhtelecom, Air Astana to be listed as IPOs in 2019",https://astanatimes.com/2019/02/kazakhtelecom-air-astana-to-be-listed-as-ipos-in-2019/,18 February 2019,2022-10-13 03:39:17.014267,"
ASTANA – Kazakh national telecom operator Kazakhtelecom and national airline Air Astana will be listed as IPOs this year, Minister of Finance Alikhan Smailov said at a Feb. 11 press conference.

“In 2019, we plan to list two Samruk Kazyna [Sovereign Wealth Fund] companies through IPOs. These are Kazakhtelecom and Air Astana. In 2020, the plan will include Kazakhstan Temir Zholy [national railway company], KazMunayGas, KazPost and Samruk Energo. In each case, Samruk Kazyna will make the decision at the board of the fund on implementation of shares through IPO. The website will list all information concerning the sales,” he noted.
This year, the ministry plans to sell another 123 facilities as part of its large-scale privatisation effort; 22 large companies under Samruk Kazyna will remain for 2020.
The privatisation programme launched in 2016 is currently 84 percent complete, said Smailov. Of the 898 objects on the list, 530 are for sale, including 473 sold for 470 billion tenge (US$1.25 billion).
The figure is 1.7 percent higher than the estimated market price and 51 percent higher than their book value, he added. This includes 47 national objects worth 44 billion tenge (US$117.2 million), 246 communal property objects worth 64 billion tenge (US$170.5 million), 102 objects owned by national holdings worth 356 billion tenge (US$948.8 million) and 78 corporate social entrepreneurship objects worth six billion tenge (US$15.9 million).
Another 280 facilities are at the reorganisation and liquidation stage.
Kazatomprom, the national atomic company, placed 15 percent of its shares ($431 million) on the London Stock Exchange and Astana International Exchange in November. It was the first national company listed on an international stock exchange and shares were purchased by 49 foreign and 17 local companies and 2,700 Kazakh citizens.
“I would like to note that the comprehensive privatisation plan is regularly updated with the facilities revealed during the inventory. Last year, an additional 48 objects were included in the list,” said Smailov.
“There are no limits for taking part in an IPO. All citizens have the right to participate in an IPO. This entitles [the individual] to revenues of the company that lists its shares on the exchange and receive part of it through dividends on one side and, on the other, if company shares grow, then through this [mechanism],” he added.

NUR-SULTAN – Samruk Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund developed a privatisation programme to launch the initial public offerings (IPOs) of Kazakhstan’s major national companies and engage foreign investors, said its Assets Management Managing Director Almasadam Satkaliyev May 17 at the 2019 Kazakhstan Global Investment Roundtable (KGIR).

Kazatomprom, the world’s largest uranium producer, placed 15 percent of its shares worth $431 million on the London Stock Exchange and Astana International Exchange in November. It was the first national company listed on an international stock exchange, and its shares were purchased by 49 foreign and 17 local companies and 2,700 Kazakh citizens.
Kazakhtelecom and Air Astana are expected to go public this year, giving momentum to the government’s privatisation programme.
“All IPO cases are different, each with a different strategy and approach,” said Satkaliyev at the roundtable on Kazakhstan’s Privatisation Drive: Building a Capital Market Through the IPO of State-Owned Champions. “Kazakhtelecom is the leading telecommunications operator in our country, accounting for 61 percent of mobile network communication. Its shares will be listed at the Astana International Exchange this year, and we are almost at the final stage. We anticipate a strong interest from the investor community because they like the company’s history.”
Stock market launches of Kazakhstan Temir Zholy, KazPost, KazMunayGas, Qazaq Air, Samruk Energo and Tau-Ken Samruk were initially planned for 2020.
“Tau-Ken Samruk is a promising national mining company that deals with solid minerals. Currently, the company operates eight projects in metals, such as zinc, copper, gold and silver. All of them are at different stages of development. We believe that we need a special programme for this company and need to attract international investment institutions and banks as investors,” he said.
Kazakhstan Temir Zholy, Kazpost and Qazaq Air, in particular, will undergo thorough preparation before launching their IPOs.
“We are working on the financial stability of the companies and understand that they should pass this stage in two to three years time and, only then, can go public,” noted Satkaliyev. “We enlisted KPMG as an independent expert (for Kazpost), and they advised that we list a certain number of its shares. Kazpost’s current operating conditions require subsidies from the government for things such as a local postal service. We believe that all these companies are very promising, especially Kazpost because it has a very interesting logistics project.”
The third annual KGIR, headlined by Kazakh Prime Minister Askar Mamin, convened more than 1,100 business executives, influential policymakers and international experts from 41 countries to promote Kazakhstan’s investment potential and introduce new technologies and global best practices for local implementation.

Kazakhstan’s KazMunayGas to Undertake IPO This Year,https://astanatimes.com/2022/07/kazakhstans-kazmunaygas-to-undertake-ipo-this-year/,14 July 2022,2022-10-13 03:39:17.643858,"
NUR-SULTAN – KazMunayGas (KMG), a national oil and gas company, will go public in 2022, said Samruk Kazyna Board Chair Almasadam Satkaliyev.

KMG is a key asset of Samruk Kazyna National Wealth Fund, a state-owned sovereign wealth fund that controls most of Kazakhstan’s valuable assets – all worth nearly US$67.4 billion. KMG alone produces 25 percent of the country’s oil and gas condensate and 15 percent of natural gas and associated gas. It also owns a 56 percent share of Kazakhstan’s oil transportation market.
In 2021, KMG produced 21.651 million tons of oil and 8.1 billion cubic meters of associated gas and natural gas. Besides its exploration activities, KMG operates the four largest refineries in Kazakhstan and two in Romania.
The initial public offering (IPO) of KMG shares will take place on the platforms of Astana International Exchange (AIX) and KASE (The Kazakhstan Stock Exchange). The fund and KMG have hired investment banks to prepare the listing.
“The main point of our development strategy is the reduction of the share of Samruk Kazyna in the local economy and the implementation of our comprehensive privatization plan. In February this year, the government approved new criteria for our assets to be included in the list of the privatization program. The philosophy of this criteria is based on the idea to promote an inclusive economy and create competitive markets,” said Satkaliyev at the Astana Finance Days on June 28. He noted KMG’s huge potential in terms of development and the energy transition.
Speaking about other plans for IPO, Satkaliyev said Air Astana is most ready, but considering the current geopolitical situation, conducting Air Astana IPO this year will not be effective.
There is a possibility of QazaqGas national company, which is in charge of natural gas transport via main gas pipelines, international transit, and sale of natural gas on domestic and foreign markets, going public in 2023.
“The company is young and ambitious,” he said. “The company, however, needs to focus on the growth in the resource base and implementation of large infrastructure projects.”
Addressing the Astana International Financial Centre management council meeting on June 2, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev emphasized all citizens should have equal opportunity to buy shares of national companies, including through digital platforms. It is one of the ways to form an investment culture among people.
“To involve the general population, we plan to use Kazpost’s [national post company] digital infrastructure, exchanges and brokers. For example, it will be possible to buy shares without leaving home, using mobile applications, and for remote regions – to use the services of Kazpost offices,” said Satkaliyev.
KMG is among 25 companies from Samruk Kazyna included in the nation’s privatization plan for 2021-2025. Overall, the plan, which is 35 percent complete as of 2021, includes 721 state-owned enterprises.
Privatization has been a long effort for Kazakhstan. Its large-scale privatization plan for 2016-2020 was fully implemented. The share of the state’s involvement in the economy went down from 19 percent in 2015 to 14.6 percent in 2021.
In November 2018, Kazatomprom, the world’s leading uranium producer and one of the Samruk Kazyna assets, placed 15 percent of its shares worth $451 million on the London Stock Exchange and AIX becoming the first national company listed on an international stock exchange. Back then, its shares were purchased by 49 foreign and 17 local companies and 2,700 Kazakh citizens.

KEGOC to launch IPO by End of June,https://astanatimes.com/2013/04/kegoc-to-launch-ipo-by-end-of-june/,10 April 2013,2022-10-13 03:39:17.956095,"
ASTANA – KEGOC, the Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Company, will issue its Initial Public Offering (IPO) of shares by the end of June, a press conference was told on March 18.
KEGOC is part of the Samruk Kazyna National Welfare Fund. The move follows the first successful IPO offering issued by KazTransOil (KTO), the country’s largest oil pipeline company, late last year.
Later this year, KazTransGas (KTG) and Samruk Energo will also issue their IPO shares offerings, the press conference was told. 
Deputy Prime-Minister Kairat Kelimbetov told the press conference that the first round of the People’s IPO Programme had been a success. The value of the new shares had increased and boosted the value of KazTransOil (KTO) in 2012. The company reported a net profit of 33.5 billion tenge ($220 million) in 2012, a 29.1 percent increase on 2011. 
“Since offering shares in November-December 2012, the share price has increased by 10-14 percent,” Kelimbetov said. “The demand for KTO’s shares was oversubscribed by more than two-fold, after they were issued at a price 725 tenge ($4.80) per share. Since trading started, the share price has risen to 800 ($5.30) to 830 tenge ($5.50).”
“KazTransOil will distribute dividends for 2012 and direct more than 40 percent of its net profit into its shareholders’ dividends. The shareholders will receive returns on their investments and invaluable experience of co-ownership of the largest national assets,” Kelimbetov said. 
The amount of the dividends will be announced in May after the Annual General Meeting of KTO shareholders. 
Bank CenterCredit (BCC) investment analysts say the results of KTO exceeded expectations. They predict the minimum commission rate will be 38 tenge (25 U.S. cents) per share, 5.2 percent of the offering price or 4.6 percent of the current market price.
Halyk Finance has revised its forecasts for KTO shares and projects that their value will continue to rise. Experts say the cost of oil transportation services in 2012 grew only by 4.2 percent – to 2,103 tenge/1,000 kilometres ($13.94 for 600 miles), which is below the inflation rate for the year and the recent rate of cost growth (8,6 percent in 2010, 13.1 percent in 2011). 
“We have revised our valuation model, reducing growth forecast costs, and as a result we have increased our estimates of the fair shares value to 854 tenge $5.66) and raised our 12-month target price to 912 tenge ($6.04) per share and recommend buying shares of KTO,” a Halyk Finance analyst said. 
The Asyl-Invest Company recommends purchasing KTO shares as a protective hedge against the expected strong correction in global financial markets. Experts believe there are three factors that can boost the value of KTO shares: the possible transit of 7 million tons of Russian oil per year through KTO’s pipelines in Kazakhstan to China, possible additional payments from the Russian company Transneft to KTO worth $65 million for oil, and the new tariff for oil transportation at the Kasymov oil station which was approved on February 11. 
KazTransOil’s own management projects significant revenue growth in 2013 that will make the company’s securities more attractive to investors. 
“I can definitely say profits will be higher in 2013, because the tariff for oil transportation was raised on Dec. 1, 2012 for both the domestic and foreign markets. The company’s profit will rise significantly, 30 percent in 2013 above that of 2012,” KazTransOil Director General Kairgeldy Kabyldin told the press conference. 
KazTransOil issued 38,463,559 shares (just under 10 percent of its total shares) on the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) in 2012 and they were bought by 34,000 private investors and 10 pension funds. In Almaty, 4,200 people bought 48.06 percent of the entire IPO issue, in Astana, 2,500 bought 14.35 percent, in Aktobe, 4,785 bought shares, in Atyrau, 4,595, and in Mangistau, 4,614.
Samruk Kazyna announced the basic documents for the KEGOC IPO issue have already been prepared. KEGOC currently has 10,767,297 shares in circulation at a nominal value of 10,000 tenge ($66.27) each. The company’s registered capital is 106.8 billion tenge ($710 million). Its revenues came to 71.674 billion tenge ($475 million) and its net profits came to 6.941 billion tenge ($46.3 million).
New oil tariffs will increase the profitability of the company over the next three years.
Independent Kazakh and foreign consultants have worked on preparing the new IPO issue including Halyk Finance as financial consultants, Citigroup Global Markets as international financial consultants, Dechert as legal advisors, Fichtner as technology consultants, Deloitte as a consultant firm to review financial reporting procedures, Due Diligence and DF King WorldWide (Europe)/APEX Consult. 
Until 2006, KEGOC was a 100 percent state-owned company. In 2006, all of the state stock was transferred to the Samruk Kazakhstan Holding for Management of State Assets as payment for the placed shares. In 2008, the merger of Kazyna Sustainable Development Fund and Samruk Kazakhstan Holding for Management of State Assets created the Samruk-Kazyna National Welfare Fund which now owns all KEGOC’s shares.
KEGOC’s main goal is to maintain the steady operation of the country’s unified energy system and to exercise reliable control of the National Power Grid maintaining engineering, economic and ecological requirements set up by the government. It aims to establish world class operating standards and to become Central Asia’s most advanced utilities provider by 2025. 
KEGOC) received a GAMMA-5 (Governance Accountability, Management, Metrics and Analysis) rating from Standard & Poor’s Corporate Governance Rating Service on March 15, 2010.
On Dec. 22, 2010, Fitch Ratings confirmed KEGOC long-term foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at BBB and upgraded the company’s prospects from stable to positive. Its short-term foreign currency IDR was confirmed at F3. 
On April 20, 2011 Moody’s Investors Service confirmed KEGOC’s senior unsecured debt rating at Baa3 and upgraded its rating from negative to stable. This change reflected KEGOC’s strengthened financial profile in 2010 generated by the national economic recovery, supportive new tariff regulations and a limited reduction of investments compared to 2009. 
Experts believe KEGOC’s ratings continue to be aligned with the sovereign ratings given the state guarantees for 56 percent of its debt. KEGOC is under full state control and enjoys strong government support.
KEGOC, as a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna, serves as the system operator of Kazakhstan’s single power grid. It operates 24,500 kilometres (15,223 miles) of power lines with a capacity of 110-1150 kV and 74 power stations with an installed capacity of transformers of 33.6 GVA.
An Initial Public Offering or IPO is the first public offering by a company of its shares for sale. The People’s IPO programme allows Kazakhstan citizens to buy shares in the largest national companies to share in their profits. The companies issuing the People’s IPO shares were selected from the most stable corporations in the country operated by the Samruk-Kazyna National Welfare Fund. Ownership of shares in successful companies will give citizens the opportunity to profit from their development and growth through rises in share values and through the payment of dividends. 
Experts believe the programme will help the development of Kazakhstan as a regional financial centre in Central Asia.

"Top Kazakh Companies to Be Privatised through IPO in 2017, 2018",https://astanatimes.com/2016/12/top-kazakh-companies-to-be-privatised-through-ipo-in-2017-2018/,7 December 2016,2022-10-13 03:39:18.558613,"
ASTANA – A Kazakh government commission has approved the Samruk Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund’s plan to privatise major Kazakh national companies through initial public offerings (IPOs) beginning this year, head of Samruk Kazyna Umirzak Shukeyev announced Dec. 6.

“Air Astana plans an IPO in late 2017 or early 2018, depending on market conditions. The deal is already agreed with the second shareholder. As a result, the fund will own only blocking minority ownership, which is equal to 25 percent plus 1 share of voting shares. At that, 51 percent of shares must remain in the hands of Kazakh investors under the intergovernmental agreement,” Shukeyev said.
According to him, Kazakhtelecom is already 49 percent privately owned company. It is planned to prepare it for IPO at the end of 2018. A quarter of Kazatomprom shares will be sold in the first half of 2018 and a quarter of KazMunayGas shares will be sold by the end of 2018. An IPO of Samruk-Energo is planned for 2019.
“Up to 49 percent of Kazpost shares will be sold in 2019. Kazakhstan Temir Zholy will be sold only after its financial recovery in 2020,” the head of Samruk Kazyna said.
Shukeyev reported that Samruk Kazyna is also preparing Qazaq Air and Tauken-Samruk for IPO.
The head of the fund asked the Ministry of National Economy to create a working group to prepare all assets for IPO.
All approaches were approved Nov. 1 by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, said Minister of National Economy Kuandyk Bishimbayev.
“As of today, corresponding decisions were made for 153 companies of 216 companies of Samruk Kazyna and they will be transferred to the competitive environment,” the minister said.
Those include 20 companies among the top 65 major Kazakh companies and 133 second-tier companies.
Bishimbayev said the companies will be listed not only at the Astana International Financial Centre, but also on exchanges in London and Hong Kong.

"SOCAR’s IPO price set at 28,000 won, much lower than hoped, amid weak demand",https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/socars-ipo-price-set-at-28000-won-much-lower-than-hoped-amid-weak-demand/,,13-10-2022,"South Korea's largest car-sharing platform operator SOCAR Inc. said Tuesday its initial public offering (IPO) price has been set at 28,000 won (US$21.44) per share, which is much lower than the price range it had hoped for amid apparently weak demand.

The price was determined after SOCAR conducted a two-day demand forecasting from domestic and foreign institutional investors that ended Friday. It was below the lower bound of its target price ranging from 34,000 won to 45,000 won.

Despite the disappointing price setting, the company decided to go ahead with the IPO slated for later this month. It is pushing to sell a total of 3.64 million new shares with a plan to raise 101.92 billion won.

Of the total new shares that it will offer, 910,000 shares, or 25 percent, will be sold to retail investors via subscription that will be held Wednesday and Thursday.

""In consideration of the investors' voice and opinion, we decided to offer our stocks in an investor-friendly manner,"" SOCAR chief executive Park Jae-wook said.

There are concerns that the price band SOCAR had hoped for may have been overpriced, considering unfavorable market conditions, including investors' reduced appetite for risky assets. Global monetary tightening aimed at taming inflation has also weighed on the stock markets.

SOCAR has voiced confidence that it will successfully complete the planned IPO, citing its stellar performance in the car-sharing market in recent years.

With the proceeds from the IPO, SOCAR plans to increase its presence in the mobility market, expand investment in technology and buy promising mobility firms.

In a related move, the company plans within this year to launch a ""super app"" that combines the existing car-sharing services with ""micromobility,"" such as electric bicycles, and platform-based parking services.

Also in the second half of this year, it will test-provide a large-scale vehicle management solution to leading logistics giants, such as Hyundai Glovis Co. and Lotte Global Logistics Co.

Car-sharing firm SOCAR confident of successful IPO,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/car-sharing-firm-socar-confident-of-successful-ipo/,,13-10-2022,"SEOUL-- South Korea's largest car-sharing and mobility service provider SOCAR Inc. on Wednesday said that its planned initial public offering (IPO) will be successful despite unfavorable market conditions.

SOCAR, established in 2011, is seeking to make a market debut later this month after going through IPO subscription Thursday and Friday this week from institutional investors and Wednesday and Thursday next week from retail investors.

It wants the IPO price to be set at between 34,000 won (US$25.60) and 45,000 won, which will help the car-sharing service provider raise up to 205 billion won.

Its market cap after the IPO will range from 1.2 trillion won to 1.6 trillion won.

SOCAR said its stellar performance in the car-sharing market will help make its IPO successful although the local IPO market has been chilly in the face of monetary tightening and a looming economic recession.

""We are confident about SOCAR's performance this year and next year, both in expansion and profitability,"" SOCAR CEO Park Jae-wook said in a press meeting.

""We are not sure exactly how long this upward momentum (in the car-sharing service market) will last, but we cannot miss this opportune moment. It is better to seek ways to fly high with the raised funds,"" he added.

Park said SOCAR's earnings will be able to shift to the black, backed by its 79 percent market share and brand awareness that will reduce its marketing costs.

Thanks to the flourishing single-person households, people are becoming increasingly open to car-sharing, Park said.

According to SOCAR data, 64 percent of its clients are returning customers, and more than 50 percent of its users wish to keep using their SOCAR plans or delay purchases for new cars.

It holds some 19,000 cars for its service across the country. Its sales spiked 31 percent on-year to 289 billion won last year, but it suffered an operating loss of 21 billion won.

SOCAR plans to spend the proceeds from the IPO to raise its presence in the mobility market with investment in technology and the acquisition of promising mobility firms.

Within this year, the company plans to launch a ""super app"" that combines the existing car-sharing services with ""micro mobility,"" such as electric bicycles, and platform-based parking services.

Also in the second half of this year, it will test-provide a large-scale vehicle management solution to leading logistics giants, such as Hyundai Glovis Co. and Lotte Global Logistics Co.

Last year, it bought a 100 percent stake of Nine2one Inc., operator of e-bike sharing service Elecle, and acquired online parking platform service Modu Co. via a share swap.

Korea Exchange to review Kyobo Life’s IPO bid,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/korea-exchange-to-review-kyobo-lifes-ipo-bid/,,13-10-2022,"SEOUL-- Kyobo Life Insurance Co. on Thursday said the country's bourse operator will begin a preliminary assessment of its initial public offering (IPO).

The Korea Exchange (KRX) has said it will launch a panel to review the IPO bid of South Korea's No. 2 life insurer eight months after its filing.

Kyobo Life has been pushing to go public since 2018, but opposition from its shareholders has halted the process for years.

Kyobo Life Chairman and the largest stakeholder Shin Chang-jae, as well as those with special interests in the company, hold a combined 36.9 percent stake.

If the IPO is successful, Kyobo Life will begin preparing for the introduction of a new accounting rule for insurance products in 2023.

ONE store scraps IPO plan due to weak investor confidence: sources,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/one-store-scraps-ipo-plan-due-to-weak-investor-confidence-sources/,,13-10-2022,"SEOUL-- ONE store Co., a South Korean mobile app market platform, decided Wednesday to withdraw its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) due to lackluster investor confidence, financial industry sources said.

The No. 2 mobile app market operator here, after Google Play store, received lackluster response from institutional investors during a two-day demand forecasting session until Tuesday, according to the sources. Institutional bids reportedly mostly fell below the company's desired pricing band between 34,300 won ($27) and 41,700 won.

""Just this morning, ONE store considered going public by lowering the desired price, but they apparently decided to scrap the plan after concluding the company's value may not be properly recognized by the market under the current stock market situation,"" a source said.

ONE store's affiliate SK shieldus also nixed its IPO plan last week due to weak investor sentiment.

Lee Jae-hwan, CEO of ONE store, said in a press conference on Monday that the company was determined to get listed on the main bourse as planned this month, undeterred by the sister company's derailed attempt.

ONE store is the latest among several South Korean companies that have backpedaled on IPO plans so far this year. In late January, Hyundai Engineering Co., the construction arm of Hyundai Motor Group, withdrew its plan to get its stocks listed on the country's main bourse due to adverse market conditions.

ONE store logged 214 billion won in sales last year and an operating loss of 5.8 billion won. The company racked up 1.13 trillion won worth of transactions on its platform last year.

Its market share in the local mobile app market stands at some 14 percent, with Google Play's presence coming in at 71.9 percent.

SK shieldus eyes raising up to 3.55 tln won through IPO next month,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/sk-shieldus-eyes-raising-up-to-3-55-tln-won-through-ipo-next-month/,,13-10-2022,"SEOUL-- SK shieldus Co., a security arm of South Korean telecom giant SK Telecom Co., is expected to raise up to 3.55 trillion won (US$2.85 billion) through a planned initial public offering (IPO) next month.

The listing, set for May 19, will mark the biggest ever market debut by a security service provider, more than the value of its rival firm S-1 Corp., a security firm under Samsung Group.

""Our company integrated cybersecurity and physical security services. SK shieldus should not be compared with S-1 by one-to-one,"" CEO Park Jin-hyo said at an online conference.

SK shieldus, which changed its name from ADT Caps Co. last October, currently provides security services across four main categories -- cybersecurity, convergence security, physical security, and safety and care.

Last year, the company reported 1.55 trillion won in sales, trailing behind 2.31 trillion won recorded by S-1.

Park said the company aims to take over other security companies with higher technical skills following the IPO, and hire more personnel with expertise in platform.

SK shieldus said it set the IPO price range of 31,000-38,800 won.

Credit Suisse, the lead bookrunner, Morgan Stanley, KB Securities and NH Investment and Securities began taking orders from investors.

Demand forecasting for domestic institutions is slated for May 3 and May 4, with that for retail investors set to take place on May 9 and May 10.

SK On’s IPO unlikely to take place until after 2025: SK Innovation CEO,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/sk-ons-ipo-unlikely-to-take-place-until-after-2025-sk-innovation-ceo/,,13-10-2022,"SEOUL-- SK On Co. is not considering an initial public offering (IPO) for at least another two to three years but will build up its competitiveness and enhance corporate value before pushing for a market debut, head of its parent company said Thursday.

The potential listing of SK On has drawn attention since the battery unit was spun off from SK Innovation in October last year, as part of SK's push to bolster the battery business amid growing demand from global automakers vying for a bigger share in the electric vehicle market.

""What's the most important for an IPO to take place is that we need to have our battery business recognized in the market,"" Kim Jun, CEO and vice chairman of SK Innovation Co., told reporters after a general shareholders meeting.

""I expect that we should be able to deliver the performance, in terms of sales, profitability and stable management of equipment, after 2025, and I believe it would be after 2025 if we were to do an IPO,"" he said.

Its bigger rival, LG Energy Solution Ltd., set a record IPO in January that made the battery maker the second-largest company in South Korea by market cap, reflecting the global electrification trend.

Kim said SK On is at the pre-IPO stage to raise funds from investors in advance of going public.

""We need large-scale resources as we are continuing with the facility expansion ... We plan to sign the contracts (on the investments) in the first half,"" Kim said.

Industry sources predict SK On is seeking to raise between 3 and 5 trillion won (US$2.47-4.12 billion), which amounts to about a 10 percent stake in the company.

Kim forecast SK On will swing to the black in the fourth quarter of this year and achieve an annual surplus from next year. SK Innovation's battery business logged an operating loss of 683.1 billion won in the fourth quarter of last year.

In light of any possible advance into new businesses, Kim said he is looking at areas of ""non-carbon, or low-carbon energy sources,"" and discussing various ideas with SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, without elaborating further.

Earlier this month, Chey hinted at ""drawing up a new business map that incorporates energy and environment"" during a visit to a SK Innovation factory in a southwestern city.

"Money raised through IPOs hits record high in 2021 amid ample liquidity, bullish sentiment",https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/money-raised-through-ipos-hits-record-high-in-2021-amid-ample-liquidity-bullish-sentiment/,,13-10-2022,"SEOUL– The amount of money South Korean firms raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) more than quadrupled to hit a record high last year thanks to ample liquidity and the overall bullish stock market sentiment, data showed Monday.

A total of 89 companies went public in 2021 by listing stocks on the benchmark KOSPI and secondary tech-heavy KOSDAQ markets and raised a combined 19.7 trillion won (US$16.4 billion), according to the data from the Financial Supervisory Service.

The money raised from IPOs represented a 333.9 percent surge from 4.5 trillion won a year earlier, the data showed. The number of companies whose shares listed on the stock markets for the first time also jumped from the previous year’s 70.

The IPO market was driven by the overall rise in local stock markets and ample liquidity injected into the economy bolstered by low borrowing costs in line with record low policy rates intended to boost the pandemic-hit economy.

Investors got more interested in new stock listings, with the competition ratio for IPO stocks jumping to an average of 1,136 to 1 last year, up from the 956-to-1 ratio a year earlier.

The prices of newly listed stocks closed 57.4 percent higher on average on their first trading day, compared with their IPO prices. The return marked the highest in five years, the data showed.

Their average prices also jumped 54.8 percent at the end of last year from the IPO prices. But of the companies that went private, 28 firms, or 31.5 percent, saw their stocks fall below the IPO prices at the end of last year, the data showed.

The company set the final offer price at 100 riyals ($26.6) a share, the top end of a range, raising $710 million after a book-building process for institutional investors. The IPO opens for retail investors on Oct. 18 until Oct. 19. The Middle East has been a bright spot for IPOs in 2022, a year otherwise marked by stock selloffs and recession fears. Elevated oil prices and investor inflows drove deals in Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and the deals pipeline still remains busy. Arabian Drilling’s offering was fully covered across the price range of 90 riyals and 100 riyals a share within only hours of opening for subscription. About a third of the IPO will be new shares, and the proceeds will be used to scale up onshore and offshore fleet and expand operations in the Gulf Cooperation Council region. “Global investors have come to recognize the significant and integral role we play — and will continue to play — in the oil and gas value chain in the kingdom,” Chief Executive Officer Ghassan Mirdad said in a statement. “Looking ahead, we also have plans to grow and expand further into the GCC, where we are also witnessing strong demand increases.” Arabian Drilling was founded in 1964 and counts Saudi Aramco among its main customers.

Books are covered across the price range, according to a message sent to investors and seen by Bloomberg News. Arabian Drilling set the range at 90 riyals to 100 riyals per share, valuing the company at as much as 8.9 billion riyals, according to a statement on Wednesday. Investors snapping up all shares on offer shows demand for Saudi IPOs remains strong even after its stocks became the first in the Gulf to fall into a bear market this week, dragged lower by the recent plunge in oil prices. Arabian Drilling’s IPO is the largest in the kingdom since pharmacy chain Nahdi Medical Co. raised $1.4 billion, and joins a steady flow of Gulf companies that are tapping markets amid high oil prices. There have already been 22 listings in Saudi Arabia this year, more than any other full-year total, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Investor demand for listings in the Gulf has been strong, with the region emerging as a bright spot in a quiet IPO market globally. Still, the outlook is darkening with oil falling almost 40% since June on fears that a global economic slowdown caused by central banks’ aggressive policy tightening will hurt energy consumption. Schlumberger and Industrialization & Energy Services Co., majority controlled by the Saudi wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, will sell 17.7 million shares in the IPO. Arabian Drilling will sell 9 million shares, using the proceeds to scale up its onshore and offshore fleet and expand operations in the Gulf Cooperation Council region. It counts Saudi oil giant Aramco as one of its main customers, and is looking to capitalize on the state energy producer’s plans to boost oil and gas production. The bookbuilding period for institutional investors will run to Oct. 5, with the final offer price announced on Oct. 11.

The Italian energy giant has hired Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, Equita Group SpA and UniCredit SpA as bookrunners for the Milan IPO, which could kick off as soon as May, the people said. Eni could look to raise as much as 2.3 billion euros from the listing, which would make it one of Europe’s largest this year, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. The IPO is being run by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Mediobanca, the people said. Representatives for Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Eni, Equita, Goldman Sachs, Mediobanca and UniCredit declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported last year that Eni could seek a valuation of as much as 15 billion euros for Plenitude in a listing. IPO candidates have since had to reassess expectations as a darkening geopolitical landscape and increasingly hawkish central banks have piled pressure on equity markets. The poor performance of some of last year’s marquee listings, and the shelving of several recent deals, is also weighing on appetite for IPOs. Eni plans to retain a majority stake in renewables unit Plenitude after the IPO, which comes as energy majors seek to squeeze more value from their renewable portfolios. The listing of Plenitude will help Eni expand the business and give investors better visibility on its value. Already a subscriber? Sign in "

Luberef would join several Aramco subsidiaries already listed on Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange, including chemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries and Rabigh Refining & Petrochemical. Aramco is separately considering selling stakes in its trading business and retail fuels unit, and also mulling a secondary stock offering of its own, Bloomberg News has reported. If these share sales materialize, they could add billions to an already hefty IPO haul in the Middle East. While rampant inflation, tightening monetary policy and Russia’s war in Ukraine have dampened listings activity globally, the Middle East has mostly bucked the trend. High oil prices have been a boon for the region’s energy companies and buoyed local stock markets. Saudi Arabia-based investment firm Jadwa is expected to sell a 30% stake in Luberef in the IPO. The company acquired the holding in 2007 from Exxon Mobil, which originally invested in the development of Luberef’s refinery in 1978. Representatives for Aramco, Citigroup and Jadwa declined to comment, while a spokesperson for Luberef didn’t immediately respond to requests to comment. Already a subscriber? Sign in "
‘Uptick’ in North Sea IPOs forecast with high oil and gas prices on course to continue,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/north-sea/388737/uptick-in-north-sea-ipos-forecast-with-high-oil-and-gas-prices-on-course-to-continue/,"21/02/2022, 12:01 am",2022-10-13,"North Sea initial public offerings (IPOs) could be back on the menu with healthy oil and gas prices tipped to continue for much of 2022. Financial analysts have forecast an “uptick” in North Sea private-equity backed companies looking to go public as investors flock to cash in on high commodity prices. Alex Msimang, energy transaction and project partner at Vinson & Elkins, says that will also be true for other parts of the energy chain “where revenues have a positive correlation with oil and gas prices”, such as oilfield services. Just last month Var Energi ownership partners Eni and HitecVision announced plans for an IPO for the Norwegian operator. And in July, North Sea oil firm Orcadian Energy (LON: ORCA) raised £3 million through its admittance to the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange.  In recent years the decline in the valuation of oil and gas companies, in part due to dreary oil and gas prices, has made IPOs largely unfeasible. There was speculation that it could pave the way for more reverse takeovers, a process – used by Chrysaor in its merger with Premier Oil to create Harbour Energy (LON: HBR) – whereby private companies can go public without an IPO. But with Brent crude futures threatening to top $100 a barrel and high gas prices routinely making international news, the traditional method of going public is back on the cards. Mr Msimang said: “In the medium term I do anticipate an uptick in IPOs in the upstream sector.  The same should be true in other parts of the energy chain where revenues have a positive correlation with oil and gas prices, for example in the oilfield services space, where higher commodity prices mean stronger demand for new wells and the installation of facilities to boost production. “That will not necessarily apply in those parts of the energy chain, like the refinery sector, where oil or gas is a feedstock, such that higher prices are increasing input costs and squeezing margins. “As traditional lenders lose their appetites for oil and gas, companies looking to capture higher commodity prices by spending the money to grow their reserves and their production rates, now need to look for different ways to raise the necessary capital.  At the same time, those higher commodity prices are starting to look tempting to potential energy IPO investors.” While accurately predicting where the next North Sea IPO will come from is tough, there are a number of eligible candidates. Ithaca Energy, a subsidiary of Israel’s Delek Group, said last year that it was exploring options for refinancing, including going public. Similarly there were reports that Neptune Energy, backed by Carlyle Group and CVC Capital Partners, was working with Rothschild to explore a potential IPO. HitecVision’s Neo Energy, Siccar Point Energy and Spirit Energy, which is 69% held by Centrica, could also look to make the move public in the coming years. Head of oil and gas research at Investec Nathan Piper says the banking group is forecasting oil and gas prices to be strong throughout 2022. He said: “The question is will that be enough to see an uptick in investment and exploration. That is unclear at this stage. The other moving part here is private equity companies, and will more of them go public? “All eyes are going to be on Var Energi in Norway and how Harbour Energy continues to perform on the London Stock Exchange. There are also other candidates, whether it is Neo, Ithaca or Neptune – that will be interesting to watch.” There is particular scope for those companies for which gas makes up a significant part of their portfolio to take the IPO plunge. Wholesale UK gas prices have quadrupled in the last year and, as a result, household energy bills will go through the roof from April. Whether you view it as an investor or a consumer, “the signal from the market is that investment in gas production needs to increase in order to boost gas supply,” Mr Msimang said. He added: “Putting all of those trends and drivers together, there should be plenty of scope for high quality, gas-focused upstream corporates to come to market and to grow their businesses.” But despite the improved commodity outlook, there are other factors at play that mean a surge of companies in the “very near-term” is unlikely. Mr Msimang says that market volaitility will make it hard for IPO candidate to know “when and if to push the button”. He said: “Right now the macroeconomic picture is complex for multiple reasons, including spiralling inflation, upwards pressure on interest rates and also less predictability in the dollar exchange rates that are so important for any company generating dollar-denominated oil revenues. “Similarly the political uncertainty around key energy regions, i.e. Russia with its giant gas reserves, makes the landscape less certain.  That all makes it harder for companies to be confident right now in pricing and launching an IPO, or, for that matter, any other capital-raising, financing or M&A transaction.” Already a subscriber?

The exploration and production firm was launched in 2018 through the merger of Eni Norge, which owns 69.85%, and Point Resources, a HitecVision company, with 30.15%. The duo have announced their intent to launch an IPO for Var Energi and for the company to apply for a listing on the Oslo Bors, although they did not indicate a timeline. Doing so will “provide access to the Norwegian international capital markets, allow the company to diversify its ownership structure and create a strong long-term shareholder base”, the pair said. In a joint press release, Eni said the move is part of its strategy to “free up new resources” to be used in its energy transition strategy. Eni will retain a majority stake in Var Energi, it added, with both HitecVision and Eni “committed to strengthening Var Energi’s position as a leading player on the NCS”. The IPO is expected to consist of a public offering in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark and a private placement to certain institutional investors internationally. Since launching in 2018, Var Energi has built its profile through big money deals such as the acquisition of ExxonMobil’s Norwegian portfolio for £3.6 billion, covering 20 producing fields, in 2019. The firm is the largest “pure play Norwegian Continental Shelf independent”, with average net production of 247,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day for the three months ended September 30, 2021. As of that same date, Var has net reserves estimated at 1.1 billion boe. Already a subscriber? Sign in "
Ashtead Technology forecasting full year revenue increase of 30%,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/north-sea/subsea/380403/ashtead-technology-forecasting-full-year-revenue-increase-of-30/,"18/01/2022, 7:31 am",2022-10-13,"Ashtead Technology is forecasting a buoyant balance sheet after a “strong performance” in 2021. The Aberdeenshire subsea equipment provider benefitted from “improving market conditions” last year in both offshore wind and oil and gas. As a result its full year revenue is expected to be around £55 million, up 30% on 2020 and ahead of previous guidance. The increase was driven by both equipment rental and a higher than anticipated level of new equipment sales in the fourth quarter. Moreover the utilisation of equipment rental has picked up, aided by a recovery in pricing from the impact of Covid. Ashtead’s adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) is expected to be “modestly ahead” of previous guidance, while adjusted EBITA is forecast to be “comfortably ahead”. Allan Pirie, chief executive officer, said: “We are pleased with the full year performance which demonstrates the momentum in our business, delivering on what we set out at our IPO. “We remain confident that Ashtead Technology is ideally positioned to support energy producers’ transition to more renewable sources of energy and benefit from the global investment into offshore wind. “We look forward to continued progress through 2022.” In November Ashtead reached a market valuation of nearly £130m from its initial public offering (IPO). The company was admitted to the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange where it trade under the ‘AT’ ticker. Although new institutional investors came forward, the company said the current owners – London-based investment firm Buckthorn and financial institution APICORP – shall remain significant shareholders.

Indonesia-focused Conrad set for Australia IPO,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/asia/444178/indonesia-focused-conrad-set-for-australia-ipo/,"14/09/2022, 3:34 am",2022-10-13,"Indonesia-focused oil and gas company Conrad Asia Energy is preparing an initial public offering (IPO) on the Australia Stock Exchange to raise some A$45 million (US$30.3 million) as it seeks to develop its Indonesia upstream business.  The Singapore incorporated company’s flagship asset is its 76.5% working interest in the Duyung PSC, which contains the Mako Gas Field, one of the largest undeveloped gas fields in the West Natuna Basin, Indonesia. After first discovering Mako in 2017, Conrad secured approval of an initial plan of development and said it has subsequently undertaken extensive appraisal work to delineate a full field 2C Resource of 413 Bcf (on a 100% basis). Conrad said it is working with the Government of Indonesia on a revised plan of development to accommodate greater gas volumes and production rates and is currently in the process of negotiating gas sales agreements with potential buyers in Singapore and Indonesia. The revised plan contemplates 12 years of production commencing in 2025. In addition to the Duyung PSC, Conrad operates a portfolio of oil and gas licences containing leads and prospects. The company believes there is significant exploration upside potential provided through its Offshore Mangkalihat PSC (OM) and via the Aceh Joint Study Areas.  The Aceh Joint Study Areas contain numerous offshore gas discoveries as well as large exploration opportunities, noted Peter Botten the company’s chairman in a prospectus released 9 September. Botten is well known for leading Papua New Guinea-focused oil and gas player Oil Search for 25 years before it was acquired by Santos.  Botten highlighted that Asia’s demand for both oil and natural gas continues to grow as the region seeks access to cheap, locally sourced power to fuel its strong economic growth and as an alternative transition fuel. In 2020, Asia represented more than one third of global oil demand and more than one fifth of global natural gas demand. Conrad will be targeting the Singapore market, in which natural gas has accounted for 95% of power generation since 2014. Conrad believes there is a significant market opportunity in Asia to provide natural gas as a cleaner alternative to carbon intensive coal power generation and enable the region to sustain its strong economic growth as it transitions to renewable energy over the coming decades. Conrad considers an investment in the Company to be compelling for a number of reasons including:  •	attractive portfolio of assets focused on offshore gas in Asia;
•	operatorship of the Mako Gas Field, one of the largest undeveloped resources in the West Natuna Sea;
•	significant upside from continued appraisal and exploration on existing asset base;
•	compelling gas market and regional energy fundamentals;
•	multitude of near-term catalysts for value accretion; and
•	experienced Board and Management Team with proven track record.  Proceeds of the offer are primarily intended to be used for:
–	maturation of the Mako Gas Field including front end engineering and long lead items required for the development of the gas field;
–	further work on the joint study areas in Aceh and their conversion into a production sharing contract; and
–	seismic acquisition over leads identified in both the Offshore Mangkalihat PSC and should they be converted into PSCs the Aceh joint study areas. Already a subscriber? Sign in "
"Ithaca Energy IPO slated for second half of 2022, Isabella appraisal drilling imminent",https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/north-sea/438619/ithaca-energy-ipo-slated-for-second-half-of-2022-isabella-appraisal-drilling-imminent/,"24/08/2022, 3:09 pm",2022-10-13,"A rough timeframe has been given for North Sea operator Ithaca Energy’s planned IPO in London. Parent firm Delek Group revealed in its second quarter results that it is aiming to list the company during the second half of 2022. It stated that it continues to “promote an equity transaction” in Ithaca, including by way of an IPO on the London Stock Exchange. To that end, Ithaca is “making progress with the relevant authorities” with the preparation of the documents needed for the listing. Estimates have not been given on the firm’s targeted market valuation. Ithaca is growing to one of the largest players in the UK North Sea. In the last few months alone it has completed high-profile deals for Marubeni, Summit Exploration and Siccar Point Energy, which owns the controversial Cambo oil field. Delek said: “As part of its strategic plan to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange, and to expand and extend its production profile, on June 30, 2022, Ithaca finalised the acquisition of the entire share capital of Siccar Point Energy, which owns rights at different rates in producing oil and gas assets and commercial discoveries in the North Sea region. “According to the report prepared by NSAI, as at December 31, 2021, Siccar Point has proved and probable reserves and a quantity of contingent resources in a best estimate amount to 256 million barrels of oil equivalent. “Siccar Point also has substantial tax carry forwards in the amount of $3 billion.” Israeli firm Delek has also provided an update on appraisal drilling at Isabella, previously dubbed “one of the most exciting prospects in the UK’s Central North Sea.” Neptune Energy, which has a 50% non-operated stake in the prospect, confirmed plans earlier this year to commit £76 million to the appraisal well. Operator TotalEnergies (30%), Ithaca (10%), and Euroil Exploration (10%) hold the reaming stakes in the prospect. Delek has confirmed that drilling at Isabella, about 165 miles south-east of Aberdeen, should commence in August or September. Work is expected to continue for around 165 days. Delek said: “Depending on the findings of the drilling, about 100 more days may be needed in order to carry out further actions to collect more data and conduct production tests, if a decision is made to carry them out. “These dates may be updated, inter alia, depending on the availability of the drilling rig, pending approvals by various authorities, according to onsite conditions, the drilling’s findings etc.” Already a subscriber?

Ithaca aiming for ‘support from all parties’ on Cambo push,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/north-sea/west-of-shetland/402005/ithaca-energy-cambo-chairman-gilad-myserson/,"11/04/2022, 7:00 am",2022-10-13,"The chairman of Ithaca Energy, soon to be the new operator of the controversial Cambo oilfield, has said the firm wants open dialogue with environmentalists and other parties on its future. Gilad Myerson said work on emissions is “paramount” for Ithaca, and hopes to gain “support from all parties” should it succeed in meeting climate regulations and government guidance for the polarising project. Cambo continues to be a battleground for climate campaigners, including those who criticised regulatory approval of Ithaca’s comparatively tiny project, Abigail, in the North Sea earlier this year. Ithaca is hoping to reach a final investment decision on Cambo next year, but is first going into discussions with partners, the government and the North Sea Transition Authority. It is also working to fully understand the emissions profile of the project as a priority, Mr Myerson said, as the company seeks to slash its own emissions by 25% by 2025, two years ahead of industry targets set out in the North Sea Transition Deal. “We want to make sure that the carbon intensity of Cambo is good. From what we’ve seen, it looks exceptional. It’s going to be significantly lower than the average UKCS and global averages. “We need to understand the exact emissions profile. Once we have all of that information, we’ll look into the economics and make a decision on how we move forward. “I would say that, as an organisation, we’re agile and swift, we like to make decisions quickly, collaboratively and then get on with things.” On the potential for backlash from environmental campaigners, he added: “We’re trying to understand the different perspectives. We’re very open and transparent. We like to work in a very collaborative way. “I think given the extremely unfortunate events happening between Russia and Ukraine, there’s a huge push for domestic energy and domestic security. “People in the UK are feeling the need for energy and control of energy. More and more people are talking about the importance of the North Sea for energy in the UK. “So when it comes to doing development, I would hope environmentalists and organisations will be part of the dialogue. Anything that we do is in line with government regulation and guidance, and if we operate within that I should hope that we can get approval and support from all parties.” The UK Government announced its new energy strategy last week which, along with confirming climate checkpoints for the new licensing round due in the Autumn, put maximising North Sea oil and gas recovery at its heart. Within that, Mr Myerson said Ithaca is “more than happy to play a responsible role and do that in a sustainable manner”. Ithaca, owned by Israel’s Delek Group, announced a deal worth a total just shy of $1.5bn last week to buy Siccar Point Energy from its private equity backers Bluewater and Blackstone. Though the deal may have come as a surprise to many, Mr Myerson said Siccar Point has been a takeover target for years, and the marriage makes sense. “I’ve been looking at Siccar Point for over two years. If you take Ithaca and Siccar Point they are incredibly complementary on multiple dimensions. “If you look at just the production and reserves. We have very high production, our reserve ratio is 8-10 years. They have low production but tremendous reserves. So you put that together, it creates a very strong and robust company for the long-term.” Ithaca, which has plenty work in the pipeline ahead for the UK, has always “punched above its weight”, but Siccar Point “takes us to the next level”, he added. The operator, which acquired Chevron’s North Sea business in 2019 and has been on a  run of acquisitions in recent months, is establishing itself as a leading independent player in the sector. Unlike some other similar firms, Ithaca is operator for most of its production, and Mr Myerson said it is completely dedicated to the UK and the North Sea going forward. As a signal of that to employees, Ithaca has bought the building it works out of at Hill of Rubislaw. “We have unwavering commitment to the UK and the North Sea. We’re here for the long term, this isn’t a private equity play where we’re coming in and coming out. “We’re here to stay, we have a lot of capacity and therefore a lot of room for additional employees.” There remains players in the UK who don’t, however, see their future in the North Sea, and Ithaca sees further deals potential despite having seriously expanded its portfolio recently. As well as Chevron, and Siccar Point, the firm has done deals with Mitsui, Marubeni and Summit Exploration and Production recently. Mr Myerson said: “If we see an opportunity where we believe we will be able to add value and fulfil the UK’s mission of maximising economic recovery as well as our shareholders’ hurdle for returns, we’ll be more than happy to get into more deals”  The Ithaca chairman also reaffirmed the message from chief financial officer David Crawford last year that an initial public offering (IPO) is “on the agenda”. Norwegian player Var Energi recently listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and UK North Sea giant Harbour Energy (formerly Chrysaor) made its London debut in London a year ago this month. Others, like Neptune Energy, are also rumoured to be looking at a public offering. Mr Myerson said: “We are considering it. I think it’s fair to say that most of the companies our size are considering capital markets. If you look at Neptune, Chrysaor went into (IPO) with Harbour, and many others have been contemplating as well as ourselves. “We want to be ready with an IPO when the market is right. We watched closely what happened with Var Energi on the other side of the border. “It is on the agenda and we’ll do it when the time is appropriate.” [[intro]] [[outro]] "
Ashtead Technology enjoys solid debut on AIM market,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/north-sea/subsea/366792/ashtead-technology-aim-market/,"24/11/2021, 7:02 am",2022-10-13,"Ashtead Technology enjoyed a solid debut on the London Stock Exchange’s AIM market yesterday. The Aberdeen-based subsea equipment company is the fifth in Scotland to have listed on the junior market, which Mike Timmins, EY’s strategy and transaction partner has said is “great news” for corporate ambitions north of the border. Ashtead joins meal delivery service Parsley Box, battery maker AMTE Power and Artisanal Spirits, owner of the Scotch Malt Whisky Society – and another, Calnex, which listed at the end of last year – which are among the Scottish companies to raise funds on the London markets in the last 12 months. However, while the number is high for Scotland, demand for initial public offerings (IPOs) has been far higher in other areas of the UK with the likes of Made.com and Victoria Plumbing, which achieved the largest IPO on AIM with £1 billion in June. Mr Timmins said: “It is more than the norm here in the last 12 months but if you compare it to Manchester and North West or the Midlands or London it’s just on a different scale.” Last week, Ashtead Technology revealed it had reached a market valuation of nearly £130 million in its IPO after it received support from new institutional investors. The company said it had agreed a placing of 31,832,800 ordinary shares at 162p per share. Last night the company’s shares closed at the same level, having hit a high of 170p during the day.

IPO planned for Fred Olsen offshore wind business,https://www.energyvoice.com/renewables-energy-transition/wind/385074/ipo-planned-for-fred-olsen-offshore-wind-business/,"03/02/2022, 3:27 pm",2022-10-13,"Fred Olsen’s offshore wind installation and servicing business, Windcarrier, is planning an initial public offering (IPO) on the Oslo Stock Exchange and will order a fourth newbuild vessel in anticipation of growing demand. In a February 3 update Fred Olsen Windcarrier (FOWIC) said it would seek to raise around €150 million (£126m) in a listing, in part to fund a fourth newbuild vessel for its installation fleet. Parent company and Fred Olsen owner Bonheur said it would remain a long-term majority shareholder and has pre-committed to subscribe for €25m (£21m) in the IPO. FOWIC said it had received “significant anchor interest” from Nordic institutions, international sector specialists as well as other local and international investors. The Oslo-headquartered company installs offshore wind turbines and provides wind operations and maintenance services, and currently operates three purpose-built transportation and installation (T&I) jack-up vessels Since delivery of its first vessels the company says it has installed approximately 20% of all offshore wind turbines globally with the exception of China, and with an established client base, describes itself as a “first mover” in new markets outside Europe. As of January 2022, it said total revenue backlog stands at approximately €355m (£297m), around 18% of which is options. Given the anticipated increase in offshore turbine size, FOWIC is currently undertaking an investment program for its three existing vessels to future-proof them for next-generation installation projects. Upgrades, including a new 1,600-tonne crane and additional deck space, are now being fitted to its Bold Tern vessel, with expected completion in Q2 this year. While it notes a slight delay due to COVID challenges, it said any associated cost are covered by the yard. Its two remaining vessels will be upgraded in 2024 and 2025 after completion of several planned T&I projects. FOWIC chief executive Alexandra Koefoed said today: “We are proud of how Fred Olsen Windcarrier over the last decade has been part of shaping what today is a truly global industry through establishing its position as one of the leading wind turbine installation contractors in the world. “As the activity within this industry is set to further increase in the years to come, we are confident that Fred. Olsen Windcarrier will leverage on its extensive experience and trusted client relationships to further develop our already strong project pipeline.” Subject to approvals from the Oslo Stock Exchange and the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority, the company said it expects its first day of trading within Q1 2022. It has enlisted Arctic Securities and DNB Markets as joint coordinators and bookrunners for the offering. FOWIC will make further announcements relating to the IPO in due course. It follows news in November that Bonheur would create a new Fred Olsen unit tasked with developing floating wind and solar technology. Already a subscriber? Sign in "
Billionaire bets on renewables in biggest 2022 Philippine IPO,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/442084/billionaire-bets-on-renewables-in-biggest-2022-philippine-ipo/,"06/09/2022, 1:45 am",2022-10-13,"Philippine billionaire Enrique Razon made his fortune operating ports and running casinos. His next target is the country’s nascent renewables industry. The nation’s second-richest man is focusing on solar farms, battery facilities and water projects in an effort to attract international investors. His green push through Prime Infrastructure Holdings Inc., which will go public later this year, is aligned with broader plans by the government to increase the use of renewable energy to 50% by 2040. The need for more energy of any sort is urgent in the Philippines, where growth in power demand has outpaced new capacity. The Southeast Asian nation, which imports almost all of its oil requirements, is looking to spend more on fuel subsidies as a cushion against higher prices. Developing domestic renewable sources will also help the nation reduce dependence on oil and coal.  The country is “probably not where we should be in terms of power supply demand. We’re probably not where we should be in terms of water availability and sanitation, or probably not where we should be in terms of waste management and climate. If you take all that into consideration as an investor, it’s perfectly logical to invest into the Philippines and Prime Infra,” Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Lucci said in an interview. It’s building a solar-and-battery facility that will displace annual consumption of about 1.4 million tons of coal, equivalent to nearly 6% of the nation’s annual needs. Also in the works are a 1,400-megawatt hydropower plant at Laguna de Bay just south of Manila, as well as two water projects that will provide 518 million liters of water to areas around the capital by 2025. Getting these projects off the ground will depend on the firm’s planned 25.6 billion pesos ($449.2 million) initial public offering in November, which is poised to be the biggest IPO this year and among the largest ever in the Philippines. Only eight firms have listed in the nation this year, raising a total of 17.2 billion pesos. That’s set to be the worst showing since 2018 amid a global market slump.  “It will be a major play on Philippine renewable energy, a narrative that’s still in the early stages of growth and a sector the government wants developed,” said Carlos Temporal, analyst at AP Securities. He said the IPO “could attract strong demand because of the industry it’s in and the company’s owner.” Razon, who is also the chairman of International Container Terminal Services Inc., which operates more than 30 port terminals in 20 countries, is estimated to be worth $4.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Philippines is seeking to increase renewables’ share to the overall energy mix to 50% by 2040 from just a fifth in 2019. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. , in a speech in July, said solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal energy sources are key to achieving his climate agenda.  Still, there are risk to Prime Infra’s renewable ambitions. Supply chain snarls are raising the price of solar panels for the first time in a decade, and strong competition as Europe and the US boost climate ambitions could mean prices stay higher than expected for the next few years. That would raise the cost of Razon’s big solar-battery project and potentially eat into its profitability. At the moment, Prime Infra gets 80% of its revenue from Manila Water Co. Inc., which supplies half of the Philippine capital. In four to five years, revenue from electricity will account for 40% from below 20% currently, Lucci said. While its first project was a 29-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Iraq, Razon’s infrastructure company plans to grow its power, water and waste-management portfolio in the Philippines before expanding overseas, the CEO said.

The Aberdeenshire subsea specialist posted pre-tax profits for the first half of 2022 of £6.9 million, up from £2.1m in the corresponding period in 2021, an increase of 233.1%. Revenue for the six months ended June 30 2022 was £31.7m, compared to £24.7m in H1 last year. The “strong year-on-year revenue increase” was delivered through “growth across all geographic markets”, driven by higher demand in both offshore renewables and offshore oil and gas. Ashtead’s employee headcount at the end of June was 219, 7% higher than the end of last year. That has positioned the “business for continued growth”, and year to date capital expenditure investment totals £7.6m. Ashtead Technology reached a market valuation of nearly £130m from its initial public offering (IPO) last year. The company was admitted to the London Stock Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on November 23. Allan Pirie, Ashtead chief executive, said: “We are pleased with our half year performance which demonstrates continued positive momentum in the business against a supportive backdrop.  As governments set out their plans to ensure energy security, investment in both oil and gas and renewables offshore infrastructure is expected to continue.  We are well placed to benefit from this, and the market fundamentals remain strong for Ashtead Technology.  Our HY22 results and end market outlook give us increased confidence in the outlook for our business.” In addition to its half year results, Ashtead has also announced the acquisition of the entire share capital of Norwegian firm WeSubsea on a cash free, debt free basis for £5.6m. Subject to adjustment for normalised working capital, the consideration will be paid in cash on the date of completion, which is expected to be during Q4 of 2022. Founded in 2010, WeSubsea is a specialist in subsea dredging technology solutions supporting customers globally from its operating base in Aberdeenshire. The business generated revenues of £1.9m, Adjusted EBITDA of £1.1m and Adjusted EBITA of £0.9m in 2021. The purchase is expected to be earnings enhancing and exceed Ashtead’s cost of capital in its first full year of ownership. It will be the group’s sixth acquisition in the past five years, “demonstrating its commitment to growing its capability and service offering” through mergers and acqusitions. Mr Pirie said: “WeSubsea is a pioneering technology business with an excellent reputation and strong customer service ethos. Its fleet of high-performance dredge systems and strong technical know-how will be a great strategic fit for our business and will complement our extensive range of dredging, cutting, coating removal and ROV tooling solutions and services. “The acquisition underlines our ambition to be a global leader in IMR and decommissioning through providing one of the widest subsea equipment and service offerings in these fields to support our customers operations across the offshore energy sector. This is a great example of a business which has predominantly supported the offshore oil and gas market but can be repositioned into the offshore renewables space through leveraging Ashtead Technology’s international network.” Already a subscriber?

ADNOC Drilling IPO raises $1.1bn after investors place $34bn of orders,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/middle-east/352732/adnoc-drilling-ipo-2/,"28/09/2021, 7:16 am",2022-10-13,"ADNOC (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) has announced that it has raised more than $1.1billion through the IPO of its subsidiary ADNOC Drilling, which was vastly oversubscribed. Investors placed more than $34 billion of orders for Abu Dhabi-based Adnoc Drilling Company PJSC’s $1.1 billion initial public offering, further underscoring the global clamor for equity deals. ADNOC sold 11% of the subsidiary in what ranks as the biggest stock-sale yet in the emirate. Adnoc Drilling’s shares were offered at 2.30 dirhams each and will begin trading in Abu Dhabi on Sunday at 10 a.m. local time. The deal comes as IPO activity in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, particularly for energy and commodity companies, picks up. Valuations have been bolstered by this year’s surge in raw-material prices as economies recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Adnoc Drilling’s IPO is expected to be followed soon by those of Emirates Global Aluminium and Fertiglobe Holding, a fertilizer company part-owned by Adnoc. In Saudi Arabia, a $1.2 billion listing of ACWA Power International — the biggest in the kingdom since that of oil giant Aramco in 2019 — will probably price on Monday. Adnoc, which pumps almost all the UAE’s oil and gas, is increasingly seeking to raise money from its assets and help the government fund efforts to diversify the economy. Since mid-2020, it has garnered about $15 billion by selling leasing rights over pipelines and property to the likes of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc. The IPO of Adnoc Drilling is the first since it sold some of its fuel-distribution business in 2017. The lead banks on Adnoc Drilling’s transaction were First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Adnoc will retain an 84% stake in the company, while Houston-based Baker Hughes will keep its 5% share. Already a subscriber? Sign in "
Siccar Point acquisition helps boost bumper results for Ithaca,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/north-sea/440014/siccar-point-acquisition-helps-boost-bumper-results-for-ithaca/,"30/08/2022, 8:02 am",2022-10-13,"Ithaca Energy reported bumper profits in the second quarter, as parent Delek Group looks to IPO the North Sea firm later this year. Ithaca reported pre-tax profits of $854 million for the second quarter – a more than fourfold increase on the same period last year – boosted by the completion of its acquisitions of Summit Exploration and Production and Siccar Point Energy. EBITDAX totalled $905 million, while Ithaca’s revenue amounted to $617m. However, completion of its acquisition of Siccar Point resulted in negative goodwill of $666m, considerably buoying the results. It noted that this amount is non-taxable, due to Ithaca being able to recognise a deferred tax asset in relation to past tax losses that the Siccar Point was not able to do. It brings total half-year pre-tax earnings to a robust $1.7bn as the company looks towards an initial public offering (IPO) later in 2022. Reporting its own quarterly results last week, parent Delek Group (TA:DLEKG) said it was “making progress with the relevant authorities” in continuing with preparation for a listing of the North Sea player. Estimates have not been given on the firm’s targeted market valuation. As at the end of June 2022, Ithaca said net debt was $1.4bn, representing a leverage ratio of 0.9x. However, it added that “significant cash generation” after the quarter’s end had prompted even further declines debt reduction. It also recorded a draw down of $750m from its reserves based lending facility to finance the acquisitions. Production averaged 67,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), 65% of which were liquids, while unit operating costs across the company were $19/boe. Ithaca said 17 million boe (71% oil) is now hedged from Q3 2022 into 2024 at an average price floor of $63/bbl oil and 125p/therm gas. “A number of these hedges are zero cost collars, giving an upside in addition to the floor price,” its statement added. The group also began to examine the impact of the UK’s energy profits levy, adding in a note that: “The Directors have considered the impact of the Levy at the date of signing these financial statements and it is believed that the Levy will increase the deferred tax liability by $150.5 million.” At the group’s Abigail development, Ithaca said the first phase of a subsea construction campaign had been completed, involving installation of a subsea manifold and subsea isolation riser base structure, along with phase two installation of production and gas lift pipelines. First oil at Abigail is now planned for October 2022. The company also confirmed that its chief financial officer David Crawford will be stepping down from full time employment as he heads towards retirement. Iain Lewis, who joined Ithaca Energy in July this year, will assume the role of CFO as part of a managed handover. Mr Lewis has 25 years of upstream oil and gas finance experience, and has held senior positions with EY, leading financial advisory and assurance engagements for upstream oil and gas companies ranging from small cap independents to supermajors. For the past 13 years, he has occupied several executive roles in Abu Dhabi-based TAQA group including group deputy CFO and Europe CFO overseeing the UK and Netherlands upstream and midstream businesses.

UAE oil producer ADNOC to list drilling unit in Abu Dhabi IPO,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/middle-east/347828/adnoc-drilling-ipo/,"06/09/2021, 8:03 am",2022-10-13,"Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC) is planning to sell shares in its drilling unit in what would rank among the largest initial public offerings (IPO) in the United Arab Emirates. The company will offer at least 7.5% of Adnoc Drilling, it said on Monday. An IPO could value the business at up to $10 billion, Bloomberg reported earlier this year, citing people familiar with the matter. In 2018, when Baker Hughes bought a 5% stake in Adnoc Drilling, that deal valued it at about $11 billion, including $1 billion of debt. Given the valuation, a sale of that size could raise about $750 million and Adnoc said it may increase the amount of stock on offer. It will be the second IPO of one of the group’s subsidiaries after the share sale in its retail fuel unit for $850.8 million in 2017. The proposed listing comes as Abu Dhabi tries to revive IPOs on its bourse. The bourse, known as ADX, is offering sweeteners that include flexibility on the minimum stake size required for share sales and promising to reduce or forgo listing fees. Satellite operator Yahsat listed in July, and sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co. is poised to select underwriters for a potential offering of Emirates Global Aluminium that could value it at more than $15 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said last week. Adnoc has also started preparations for a potential IPO of its fertilizer joint venture Fertiglobe. Abu Dhabi, which holds most of the oil in the UAE, is using its energy assets to draw in global investors along with their funds and expertise as the nation puts cash into efforts to diversify the economy. While the UAE plans to keep selling oil for decades it’s trying to build out industries like technology, manufacturing and tourism to prepare for a world in which hydrocarbon demand is falling. The UAE is the third-biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Adnoc is pursuing a strategy of attracting investors and raising cash from minority stakes in its businesses. Regional energy powerhouses like the Saudis are also selling energy assets and trying to wean themselves off an overwhelming reliance on crude for government income. The kingdom recorded the world’s largest IPO when it sold shares in Saudi Aramco in 2019. With governments and companies looking to go green and cut oil use, Saudi Arabia and the UAE see their huge reserves of low-cost crude and natural gas supporting chemicals and hydrogen production and establishing  them among the last suppliers of crude. Adnoc Drilling IPO Offer Details: -Offer period to start on Sept. 13 and end on Sept. 23 for retail investors -Will represent 1.2 billion shares -There will be three tranches. First for individuals and others investors: offering closes on Sept. 23 -Second for qualified institutional investors: offering closes on Sept. 26 -Third for Adnoc employees and UAE national retirees: offering closes on Sept. 23 -Announcement of final offer price: Sept. 27 -Expected date of listing: Oct. 3 -First Abu Dhabi Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan are joint global coordinators -EFG-Hermes, Emirates NBD Capital, International Securities, Merrill Lynch International and Societe Generale are joint bookrunners Already a subscriber?

“Nassau Cruise Port is well-positioned and prepared for growth, which our investors will certainly benefit from.”

“We truly have much to be grateful for. Let’s continue to work to make our Bahamas even better for our guests and for Bahamian generations to come,” said Maura.
I’m tremendously excited that Bahamians were interested enough to — according to Colina — fully subscribe to the recent IPO or share sale.
– Former Minister of Tourism and Aviation Dionisio D’Aguilar
The funds raised will be used to complete the redevelopment of recreational, entertainment, shopping and food and beverage spaces; complete marine construction work; and support the development, design, engineering and inspection-related costs of the project.
The redevelopment of the port is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2022.
Operations at the port will continue without interruption during the construction phases.
Dionisio D’Aguilar.
Former Tourism Minister Dionisio D’Aguilar told Eyewitness News: “I’m tremendously excited that Bahamians were interested enough to — according to Colina — fully subscribe to the recent IPO or share sale.
“I’m delighted to read that they are actively looking for authentically Bahamian vendors to work at that port. I’m also delighted that it’s on schedule for a 2022 completion and become the flagship port we all expected.
“I’m happy its’ progressing and that the government is allowing it to come to fruition.
“At the end of the day, the Bahamian people will be very happy with the attempt to redevelop the port of Nassau and do it in such a way that it’s authentically Bahamian.”

NASSAU, BAHAMAS — The Nassau Cruise Port (NCP) has launched its $25 million initial public offering (IPO), allowing for Bahamians to invest in the redevelopment of Nassau’s cruise.
CFAL is the book runner for the Bahamas Investment Fund (BIF) offering, which represents a 49 percent equity stake in the cruise port.
The cruise port operator has a 25-year concession to operate and manage Prince George Wharf, which starts when construction ends in 2022-2023, with an extension period of 15 years.
It is intended that the vast majority of shareholders will be small investors.

The board of directors of the fund is comprised of Anthony Ferguson, Antoine Bastian and Owen Wells. 
According to BIF documents, Bahamian citizens over the age of 18 are eligible to invest as the retail fund “aims to provide economic opportunity to tens of thousands of Bahamians by providing a pathway to share ownership in the port through NCP”.
“It is intended that the vast majority of shareholders will be small investors,” the BIF documents state.

“In order to ensure wide local participation, NCP will also provide financing to Bahamians so that the ownership base is as widely distributed as possible.
“The fund minimum investment for equity is B$1,000 to facilitate small investors.”
The offering will be open from December 8, 2021, to December 17, 2021.
Work being carried out at the port includes dredging of a new Oasis-class berth on the northeastern cruise pier extension; the creation of a new mega yacht berth, also on the northeastern pier; maintenance dredging to accommodate Quantum-class vessels on the passenger pier; and dredging at the rehabilitated Prince George Wharf pier, which is also being extended, to move from accommodating Dream-class vessels to providing space for the much larger Oasis-class ships.

GET READY TO INVEST: Nassau Cruise Port IPO for Bahamians expected in October,https://ewnews.com/get-ready-to-invest-nassau-cruise-port-initial-public-offering-for-bahamians-expected-in-october-says-mike-maura-ceo,"August 3, 2021",2022-10-13 03:34:56.098303,"
Maura: It is very important that thousands of Bahamians are given the opportunity to invest in the Nassau Cruise Port
NASSAU, BAHAMAS — Bahamians will get an opportunity to own an equity stake in the Nassau Cruise Port when an initial public offering (IPO) for small investors is launched in October, according to cruise port CEO Mike Maura Jr.
In an interview with Eyewitness News, Maura said: “We expect that to happen in October of this year. Come October, we should be somewhere around the 80 percent complete stage in marine works, and we would have broken ground on our upland works.”
Mike Maura Jr.
Maura added: “It is very important that at a time such as this, when thousands of Bahamians are given the opportunity to invest in the Nassau Cruise Port, that they have an opportunity to come down and see what’s been going on for the past year and a half.
“We do appreciate that for many of these investors it may be the first time they are investing in a company generally. We want to provide them with opportunity to be educated and informed at the time of their investment.”
The IPO had originally been targeted for the second quarter of this year. The offering of a close to $25 million equity stake in Prince George Wharf’s transformation had been delayed until the 2021 third quarter in the hope that the economy would have rebounded sufficiently from the COVID-19 pandemic.



Bahamian investors will be given the opportunity to make the minimum $1,000 investment in the Bahamas Investment Fund (BIF), the vehicle that will hold a combined 49 percent stake in the cruise port on their behalf.
The Nassau Cruise Port is currently in the middle of a dredging operation, which began last week. Maura estimated there is another 10 to 12 days of dredging to be carried out.
“We are about close to 65 to 70 percent on the marine works and we are going to be breaking ground this month on the upland works,” said Maura.
“The upland works would include the arrivals terminal, Junkanoo museum, marketplace where we will have up to 50 authentically Bahamian entrepreneurs selling their retail items as well as food and beverage, then go into the plaza with the bigger businesses.”
The new cruise port is expected to be ready by summer 2022.

IPO could be in the future for Shell deal,https://ewnews.com/ipo-could-be-in-the-future-of-shell-deal,"November 14, 2019",2022-10-13 03:34:56.543312,"


NASSAU, BAHAMAS – Works Minister Desmond Bannister and Shell North America yesterday confirmed an initial public offering (IPO) for shares in the company’s liquified natural gas (LNG) facility, could be on the horizon.

Bahamas Power and Light (BPL) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Shell NA for an integrated LNG gas-to-power project just over a year ago.

A Shell spokesperson told Eyewitness News: “The plans are that Shell and BPL would form a joint venture for the ‘Power Company’ part of the project.

“The ‘Terminal Company’ would also be formed as a joint venture with Shell as the largest shareholder and certain minority interest shareholders from the Bahamas.”

The spokespersons continued: “We are in commercial discussions and will share further details when we are able.

“In the future, there may be the opportunity for the ‘Terminal Company’ to issue shares in an IPO to Bahamians, subject to market conditions and further discussions amongst shareholders.”
Works Minister Desmond Bannister confirmed these developments in an interview with Eyewitness News Online,

“I am aware. What they are doing is in accordance with our manifesto committment,” he said.

“That commitment he noted called for privatizing the utility to ensure Bahamian ownership through majority shareholding as well as providing incentives and tax concessions for the production and supply of alternate fuel sources.”

Shell NA is among the largest global energy marketers and traders, providing a comprehensive portfolio of energy-related products and services an is a pioneer in LNG.

The LNG plant is expected to produce up to 270 megawatts of power.

"'Vlora Terminal, a Future without Russian Gas'",https://albaniandailynews.com/news/-vlora-terminal-a-future-without-russian-gas-,"Saturday, August 13, 2022",2022-10-13 03:34:21.690834,"
US-based Excelerate Energy Corporation said on Thursday that global LNG market volatility during the second quarter helped serve as a springboard for its emergence as a public company and its strategy of becoming a downstream resource for energy-starved countries.The company launched its initial public offering (IPO) in April, netting it the distinction of becoming the first major U.S. LNG company to go public after Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine. Since then, Excelerate has announced a series of agreements for its liquefied natural gas procurement and floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) services on multiple fronts.Like with its IPO, CEO Steven Kobos told investors the firm’s plan to expand as an integrated energy business was aided by the scramble by countries across the world moving to secure both stable natural gas supply and the expanded infrastructure to use it, news service NGI's All News Access reported on Thursday.“Importantly, the strategic expansion downstream of our floating terminals is accelerating the growth of our gas sales business and positioning Excelerate for increased profitability,” Kobos said.Kobos said the firm’s progress during the quarter was especially apparent in Europe, where it is planning several infrastructure projects to secure regasification capacity for countries cut-off from Russian pipeline supplies.Management gave an update on one of its key projects in Europe, the Vlora LNG terminal planned for the Albanian coast. Last month, Excelerate signed a tentative 1 billion cubic meters/year (Bcm/y) agreement to supply Bulgaria’s Overgas Inc. for 10 years.Daniel Bustos, chief commercial officer, said the project was being handled differently from traditional LNG terminal projects, with early planning and development work occurring during commercial negotiations. By moving forward with initial plans without a formal final investment decision, he said, Excelerate expects Vlora could deliver gas by the second half of next year.Once the terminal is operational, Bustos said, “we expect about 1 Bcm to be dedicated to the Albanian market and 4 Bcm on some of the peaking capacity to be dedicated” to the wider European market.Kobos said progress at Vlora could be a welcome sign for European allies preparing for a future without Russian gas, but it also represents the trajectory of Excelerate as it tries to become a bridge between foreign markets and U.S. natural gas supplies.“We support Europe’s efforts to enhance its energy security through increased access to global LNG supply,” Kobos said. “This is why we have made securing access to Europe’s gas sales market a priority for Excelerate Energy.”Excelerate is also planning to support Finland with an FSRU at the end of the year after securing a 10-year charter with Gasgrid Finland Oy. Management reported Gasgrid had started work on a new jetty near the Baltic connector pipeline in southern Finland to house the unit once it ends its current service in Argentina.While a large swathe of its attention is shifting to Europe, management also outlined how its expansion into the South American market has been accelerated by supply uncertainty in Brazil. Bustos said that business with Brazil has been strong despite high commodity prices risking demand destruction because of the country’s strong economic position and “the continued deterioration of Bolivia as a credible supplier.”

",2022-10-13,"Flotation activity on the London Stock Exchange plunged in the last few months as the number of companies going public dropped by more than three-quarters, analysis has found. Turmoil in the markets and inflation pressures have prompted businesses to delay plans to go public in the UK during the latest quarter, professional services firm Ernst & Young (EY) said in its study. There was a significant drop in initial public offerings (IPOs), meaning fewer companies decided to list their shares on the main stock exchange and raise capital for the business. Just eight companies launched IPOs in July to September, raising a total of £565.5 million, according to EY. They included six firms listing shares on the main market and two on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). Ming Yang Smart Energy Group raised a major proportion of the total proceeds, bringing in £548.3 million. The figures mark a massive fall in total proceeds compared with the record £4 billion raised in the same period last year, when 33 companies went public. EY said many companies may have put IPO plans on ice until they are on stronger financial footing and there are signs of greater economic stability. Recent volatility in the financial markets has seen London’s top index, the FTSE 100, take a hammering in the latter half of September. It dropped below the 7,000 mark after the Government unveiled its mini-budget including sweeping tax cuts in efforts to stimulate growth in the economy. But with a “healthy pipeline” of IPOs, there could be a rebound in listings in 2023, EY predicted. Scott McCubbin, EY’s UK & Ireland IPO leader, said: “The London IPO market has experienced a challenging 2022.

 “Ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic instability, compounded by inflationary pressures, have meant many businesses have delayed their IPO plans until they believe inflation has peaked and stability returns to the market. “While the overall IPO outlook for the remainder of 2022 remains subdued, companies who may have paused their IPO are now re-evaluating those plans to ensure they can adapt to the new macroeconomic landscape and are ready for the recovery in 2023. “We expect listing activity to rebound in 2023 once inflationary headwinds ease, and companies have the stability and predictability required to realise their long-term growth plans.” But it is not just the UK that has seen a drop-off of public offerings, with the analysis showing a global decline. There was a 44% fall in the number of IPOs in the year to-date, and a 57% drop in total proceeds raised. This is a milder decline than in the UK, but it reflects uncertainty in the macroeconomy that has led investors to focus more on stable and low-risk companies, EY said. The energy sector bucked the trend and its proceeds went up by 176%, driven by three big deals in the year so far. Meanwhile, carmaker Porsche launched an IPO in Germany this week, in the biggest listing for the country in more than 25 years. "

",2022-10-13,"Porsche gained during its robust trading debut after parent Volkswagen AG set the final listing price for the sports-car maker at the upper limit in a bid to defy deep market upheaval. Stock rose 1.8pc to €84 in Frankfurt on the open, before slipping back to its offer price of 82.50 apiece, the top end of VW's initial range for the shares that valued the company at €75bn. The listing, reaping €9.4bn in proceeds for VW, is Europe's largest initial public offering in a decade and contends with some of the most challenging market conditions in years. ""Today, a big dream comes true for Porsche,"" Volkswagen chief executive Oliver Blume said in a statement. ""Our increased degree of autonomy puts us in a very good position to implement our ambitious goals in coming years."" The listing of the 911 maker is a bold move into public markets, which have been largely shut to IPOs for most of the year, with companies shying away from seeking new listings because of the European energy crisis, rising interest rates and record inflation. The sale will help Volkswagen raise funds to plough into its electrification push, while investors get a slice of an emotional brand akin to Ferrari NV, which also managed a successful separation from parent Fiat in 2015. ""If you can pull off an IPO in such a difficult market, it shows the attractiveness of the business,"" Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said. ""Porsche is a mature, well-known business that doesn't need to raise capital. Putting it on the market as a fully formed business – being able to pull that off is quite impressive."" Following the trading start, against a 1.9pc drop in Germany's leading DAX Index, the preferred shares of VW declined as much as 6.2pc while Porsche Automobil Holding SE, the investment company of the Porsche-Piech family, slumped as much as 9.2pc. Companies raised less than $10b in IPOs this year through August, an 83pc drop in proceeds from the same time last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Porsche's listing is set to be the largest in Europe since miner Glencore PLC raised almost $10bn in a London IPO in 2011, the data showed. The share price puts Porsche at a valuation that's not far from VW's total market capitalisation – a business that comprises Audi, Skoda, Seat, and the VW brand, among others. Yet for all its aggressive marketing, the listing has also garnered negative attention for its complex structure. Volkswagen divided Porsche's share capital into equal parts voting and non-voting shares, with the German carmaker retaining 75pc ownership. Some 12.5pc of total share capital – only non-voting shares – is being publicly listed, with a large portion going to four cornerstone investors.

",2022-10-13,"A former executive at a publicly-traded Irish fintech firm has lodged a claim for over €100,000 in lost earnings as redress for what he claims was an unfair dismissal with no stated reason by the company last September. Thomas Hackett says he was promised a “substantial equity package” when he was headhunted to join tech entrepreneur Maurice Healy’s Glantus as a start-up – but that he was denied this shareholding by being sacked before he could take ownership of it. He has lodged statutory complaints against his former employer under the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997. His former employer insists the WRC has no jurisdiction to hear a complaint by Mr Hackett under the 1977 act, arguing he worked less than the full year required, which the complainant disputes. At a hearing yesterday afternoon at the Workplace Relations Commission headquarters in Ballsbridge, Dublin 4, Mr Hackett’s barrister said the shareholding was still being pursued in the High Court – but that his client was seeking compensation for a year’s lost earnings. He said Mr Hackett’s gross annual salary before his dismissal was €100,000, plus expenses of €500 a month. Pádraig Lyons BL, who appeared for the complainant instructed by Byrne Wallace solicitors, said that 10 days prior to the firm’s initial public offering in May 2021, his client got a phone call from its CEO, Maurice Healy, telling them there had been “a mistake” in the complainant’s share option certificate. He said his client rejected that proposition and that Mr Healy replied: “You’ve only been with the company eight months and you don’t deserve to have your share options vest upon the IPO.” Mr Hackett said it would be unfair for him to wait for a later vesting period to elapse, Mr Lyons told the tribunal, but that Mr Healy went on to tell him that if he did not agree to do it the employer would “take the necessary action to make sure that it happens”. Mr Lyons added that in return for agreeing to the vesting period, his client secured an undertaking from his employer “whereby his contract could not be terminated without six months’ notice”. Mr Hackett having relocated to his native Boston, Mr Healy then said the complainant should transfer his employment to Glantus’s US arm, counsel said. Mr Lyons said his client was then presented with an “at-will” employment contract on 23 August 2021 and that when he raised issues with it – including the six-month notice period – there was “radio silence” from the company’s HR officer.

 “What then happens is that on the 9 September 2021 [the HR officer] calls Mr Hackett and sacks him. No reason, no warning, nothing,” Mr Lyons said. He said his client had later received a letter stating that the company had “assessed, monitored and evaluated performance” in respect of Mr Hackett and “didn’t find his skills to be a good match”. “Mr Hackett knew nothing of this and didn’t have an opportunity to contribute to it at all,” he said. There was extensive legal argument over the question of whether Mr Hackett’s employment had lasted a full year. Lorna Lynch SC, instructed by A&L Goodbody for the respondent, submitted that that Mr Hackett’s original employment contract had commenced on  October 1, 2020, but was then backdated by the company to Saturday September 26, that year – making September 28, 2020, his first day. The company’s position was that the complainant had been given notice of termination on  September 9, 2021, and was paid his notice in lieu, meaning he had less than a year’s service with the company and so could not avail of the Unfair Dismissals Act. She added that Mr Hackett received payment in full for six months’ salary at this point. Mr Lyons contended that his client had been working for the company from September 15, 2020, when his client attended a virtual strategy meeting, after which he had worked “extensively” for the rest of that month. Mr Lyons argued that as Mr Hackett had a contractual entitlement to a six-month notice period and his employer had chosen to pay in lieu, the correct termination date was the date of the payment on September 29, when the payment was made. “Even if it’s accepted that Mr Hackett’s employment started on the 26 [of September 2020], the payment was made on the 29 [September 2021] – that is one year later,” he said. Ms Lynch said the complainant had pursued back pay and expenses when his contract was backdated shortly afterwards, but had not sought pay back to the middle of September 2020. Both sides cited the 2012 ruling of the UK Supreme Court in Société Générale v Geys as a precedent in the matter – with Ms Lynch arguing that the court had placed more weight on the notification itself rather than the date of payment. Mr Lyons argued further that Section 13 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 voids any contract terms which “purport to exclude or limit the application” of the Act. “Section 13 means that if an employer seeks to use a pay in lieu of notice term to exclude him from the Act, it is void,” he said. However, he admitted this was a “difficult” point as there was no direct precedent and he was not aware of any prior occasion where the argument had been made. “Mr Lyons seems to be saying that a pay in lieu of notice clause is fine, but if deployed close to one year they become void ab initio… Perhaps there’s a reason the argument hasn’t been made before – certainly this isn’t the case for it,” Ms Lynch said. Adjudicating officer Breiffni O’Neill adjourned the matter to November. "

         Volkswagen sets Porsche IPO at up to 9.4 billion euros",https://www.independent.ie/world-news/volkswagen-sets-porsche-ipo-at-up-to-94-billion-euros-42001047.html,"

",2022-10-13,"Volkswagen has set the price range for the multibillion-euro sale of a minority stake in luxury brand Porsche as it prepares an initial public offering to fund VW’s investments in new technologies and businesses including electric cars, software and services. The German car maker said it aims for a listing on the Frankfurt stock exchange on September 29 after it places up to 25% of non-voting preferred shares in Porsche AG, maker of the 911 sports car and Cayenne SUV, with investors. The Qatar Investment Authority has committed to acquire 4.99%, with smaller stakes going to Norges Bank Investment, T. Rowe Price and ADQ. The price range per preferred share was set at 76.50 euros (£67.15) to 82.50 (£72.44) euros, which translates to 8.71 billion (£7.65bn) to 9.39 billion euros (£8.24bn). Porsche’s share capital has been split into 50% preferred and 50% ordinary shares, so that the IPO stake represents 12.5% of the company. The deal also includes the sale of 25% plus one share of ordinary shares at a 7.5% premium to Porsche Automobil Holding SE, Volkswagen’s controlling shareholder representing the Porsche and Piech families. Under the maximum price, the total reaped by the sale of both preferred and ordinary shares would be 19.5 billion euros (£17.1bn), 49% of which would be paid out as a dividend to shareholders while the rest would be available for the company’s investment objectives. Volkswagen has launched a major push into electric vehicles and says future profits will increasingly come from investments in electric cars, software and services as traditional internal combustion cars take a smaller share of the market. The car maker says the deal will give Porsche more “entrepreneurial autonomy” but that it will continue to fully include Porsche in its financial statements. VW added that existing industrial cooperation between Volkswagen and Porsche would be “comprehensively continued”.

                Stephanie Harrison talks work, motivation

                        ",2022-10-13,"STEPHANIE Harrison is assistant VP marketing at Mayberry Investments. We caught up with her to talk about her life, career, and some advice for women entering the field. AW: What was your first job?  SH: My first job was at the age of 13 years old, handing out fliers at a GraceKennedy road show. My mother was a single parent and she believed that teaching me responsibility at such a young age would mould me to be independent and responsible for my actions. I knew that you had to be disciplined and committed to anything you put your mind to in order to achieve your goals in life. AW: What would you say is your best career achievement to date? SH: My greatest accomplishment is this year's promotion to assistant vice-president of marketing. I began working for Mayberry in a marketing officer role seven years ago and gradually excelled to digital marketing manager, then to senior manager. Now, I lead the department of one of the premier financial institutions in Jamaica. I attribute this success to my dedication, my drive, my knowledge, my positive attitude, and my development approach.  AW: When would you say you have worked the hardest? SH: One of the most challenging projects I had to work on was in 2019. I had to implement and execute the company's digital marketing and communications efforts in the Government of Jamaica's divestment of the largest wind farm in the Caribbean, Wigton Windfarm Limited. That transaction set many precedences, and I'm truly grateful to have been an integral part of that historical IPO (initial public offering). AW: What is your go-to thing for motivation? SH: I love to travel. It facilitates a process of introspection, allowing me to reflect on my own emotional and mental well-being. That's the time when I finally get the distance away from all the demands of my daily activities and responsibilities. Even the benefit of flying on an airplane without Wi-Fi; finally the chance to disconnect, gives me a chance to open up and free my mind. I believe that one of the biggest benefits of travelling is the enlightenment and exposure it brings â€” learning about different cultures, different modes of living, and to expand my mind about the world, trends and humanity. AW: What is your advice to young women who are looking to pursue a career in your field? SH: Learn to accept criticism. Don't stop learning. Be independent and a team player at the same time. It's hard at times to hear that your skills are not as polished as you thought. When someone gives you feedback that's not what you want to hear, leave your emotions out of it and use their feedback as an opportunity to grow and better your skills over time. It's important to always have a positive attitude at anything that you do; it's always a growing experience. Similarly, realise that you are going to make mistakes along the way. Make sure to learn from them. One of the most valuable job skills you can bring to any profession is being able to work independently when needed but also know when you need to collaborate and be part of the team. Teamwork makes the dream work! "

                Doing it right — the tTech story
            ",https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/doing-it-right-the-ttech-story/,"

                        ",2022-10-13,"Comfort is the preference of anyone for anything they do. However, there comes a time when you have the chance to try something different and do it a different way. While some shy away from anything outside of their comfort zone, there are people we call entrepreneurs who take a leap of faith to do something for the joy of what they do and bringing a great experience to others. Today's Corporate Profile will explore the story of tTech which was formed to provide a service which was generally absent from the Jamaican landscape. Edward ""Teddy"" Alexander was GraceKennedy Limited's (GK) chief information officer in 2006 where he oversaw the information technology (IT) set-up for the Jamaican conglomerate. He also had the responsibility of re-establishing GK's USA (United States of America) head office in Florida which included the development of the core food and financial segments, particularly remittance services. He had been at GK since 1988 when he joined as an account manager. Teddy is the son of former GK chairman and CEO (chief executive officer) Selwyn Carlton Alexander and brother to then GK Chief Risk Officer Uriah Phillip Alexander. In 2006, GK underwent cost rationalisation where the various departments were asked to find ways to reduce corporate expenses which were deemed too high by their consultants. However, there was no local firm in Jamaica which catered to outsourced IT services. This was in contrast to the USA where outsourcing companies and remote support services were readily accepted in the digitally accepting society. It was at this time that Teddy convened with GK professionals Gregory Henry, Hugh Allen and Ayrton Salmon on the idea to create an outsourcing company to manage the IT resources for GK.  This resulted in the formation of tTech Limited on December 1, 2006 and Teddy leaving his role at the conglomerate. ""tTech was started because I had been in corporate life for 18 to 20 years and I'd seen things that I thought, 'Is there a different way to run a company'. I have certain philosophies about what I'd like to see in terms of how companies are run, what a company does and so on. In particular, I wanted to see if I could create a company and build around people's strengths,"" Teddy explained to the Jamaica Observer in a recent interview. GK awarded the firm the contract which Teddy saw as a big deal and memorable moment. This allowed tTech to start approaching other local companies to manage their IT resources at a time when appreciation for IT was still developing. ""Well, the services we focused on was primarily the management of core IT infrastructure ie the network, servers and security systems. Basically, the system that required a fairly high degree of technical knowledge to be able to manage and administer. Knowledge of those systems are things that really didn't contribute to a company's business. Knowledge in that infrastructure was really a cost to business rather than a benefit. By outsourcing to us, GraceKennedy was able to reduce the cost of managing those IT assets,"" he explained. The formation of tTech gave the CEO the opportunity to create an environment for the positive development of professionals while serving a steadily growing customer base. This is currently seen through the level of qualifications which tTech's team members continue to accumulate in the IT space. ""I'm of the view that if I can create an environment that you are allowed or given the opportunity to work in an area that you're good and strong at, have a passion for it and can spend most of your time working in those areas, I believe that you will excel in whatever you're doing. It won't feel like work. If I could create an organisation of teams where people were able to function in those areas, I just think it could be a completely different type of company,"" Teddy added. The company grew slowly over the years with it having five employees in 2007 and reaching 12 employees by 2012. tTech kept adding different services such as a service desk to assist and support end users, PBX (private business exchange) systems for telephone networks for companies and even consulting. However, there were early lessons which the CEO began to appreciate as he tackled multiple roles in the growing company. While he admitted mistakes along the way, he was grateful to learn the skills needed for certain roles based on his experience managing them. ""Like any organisation, you'll have your ups and downs during the growth periods. The decision about when was it necessary to bring in new people, bringing in different levels of expertise, decisions about hiring and when to bring on people and give up some of the things that maybe I was doing. In a very small company, you find that the CEO is also the chief HR officer, chief financial officer and as a result, it's knowing when the time had come to bring somebody else on board and to relieve yourself of those responsibilities,"" Teddy said. While listing on the Jamaica Stock Exchange helped the company to gain more prominence in recent years, tTech decided to list for two reasons. The first was the expected expiration of benefits for companies which were to list on the Junior Market by the incumbent government at the time. ""In 2015, we realised that the benefits associated with listing on the Junior Market of the stock exchange were going to expire in 2016 and there was no indication that these benefits were going to be extended. We thought well, if we are going to list, then let's do it,"" he added. tTech listed on January 7, 2016 as the first technology company on that market where they raised $50.26 million with all employees becoming shareholders. Employees were able to purchase shares at $0.75 compared to the general public price of $2.50. ""I believe that if you give people an opportunity to own shares in the company, then I believe that they will work, treat the customers differently and work in a different way. Listing also creates an opportunity for us to provide all the people who were employed at tTech at the time shares in the company. They were able to benefit from that IPO,"" Teddy mentioned. While some of the company's staff migrated over the years, they still credit tTech as a great foundation to their development. Gregory Henry is now an IT professional with a Canadian Bank while Ayrton Salmon works with Xsomo. ""Personally, it's moving as you had an impact on these people and seeing it manifest in their lives,"" Teddy added on one of his memorable memories. On March 1, 2018, Teddy stepped down as CEO for Christopher Reckord to take up the role while Teddy became the executive chairman and took over from his brother. This facilitated the opportunity for Reckord to lead the company's next major developments. ""At last year's Techcon, one of the sessions we had was on digital transformation and Christopher Berry, the executive chairman of Mayberry Investments, he spoke about why they took the decision to outsource their IT services to tTech and the positive effect it had on Mayberry and how it helped them to get on with their digital transformation journey. It was really great hearing that coming from someone like Chris,"" Teddy reflected on the impact the firm has had on local companies in advancing their digital journey. Other firms which have credited tTech include Island Car Rentals, Garbage Disposal and Sanitation Systems and Fidelity Motors. tTech has gone six years as a listed company and has seen highs and lows amidst the shifting environment which has been impacted by supply chain disruptions and spike in cyberattacks. However, the company is forging ahead to cater to its clients needs and incoming ones based on the transition to come with the Data Protection Act. The company is also encouraging remote work and has face-to-face as needed. This is driven by a focus on outcomes rather than seeing someone physically seated at a desk. We're still in early days. We're coming to the end of our 15th year. We are refocussing heavily around the area of cybersecurity. We are looking at what we need to do get the company operating more efficiently to create more foundation elements for future growth. Our company still has a long runway ahead of it. There are still may growth opportunities for us in Jamaica and we're now beginning to actively explore opportunities to grow outside of Jamaica particularly in North America. We believe that market is one that will be more readily accepting of outsourced IT services albeit from Jamaica. When asked what he'd tell other upcoming entrepreneurs about the journey, Teddy said, """"You have to have your vision and really believe in the vision. If you really believe in it, then you can envision it and it is possible to achieve it. Don't just go out of there with a vision, go there with a plan. There is a saying of luck is when opportunity meets preparation. Before you just embark on a journey because you think you have a good idea, actually sit down, think it through and really do your planning. Why would anyone buy my service and why would anyone do business with me? Work it through and run it by others."" ""I have no regrets about having worked with GraceKennedy. In fact, I dare say having worked with GraceKennedy prepared me in many ways for starting and running tTech. It was after leaving GraceKennedy I realised how much you take for granted when you work in a company like that. The type of resources that are available for you to get things done. All of a sudden when you're an entrepreneur, you're on your own doing everything yourself. It's a different world,"" Teddy closed. "

                        ",2022-10-13,"VM Investments Limited (VMIL) has said it will continue to increase and improve its digital channels in a bid to lift the level of service delivery. The company will also be rolling out new digital proucts to complement the already existing VM Wealth IPO Edge. ""Couple years ago we rolled out our client management portal — that was phase one — and we're midway through the release of the updated version that will give our clients a lot more functionality. We've received the feedback from our clients and as painful as it is sometimes, we are certainly responding to the needs of our clients,"" VMIL and VM Wealth CEO Rezworth Burcheson informed shareholders during a virtual investor briefing last Wednesday. ""We believe that the client management portal will be a multi-year programme to add more self-service channels to allow them to engage better with the organisation,"" he added. The CEO said that having assessed VMIL's current client base and creating a profile for future customers, digitalisation will play a key role in client engagement. He also revealed plans to upgrade the financial institution's OPICS platform — VMIL's treasury management software — over the next 12 months. Following the successful initial public offer (IPO) of Dolla Financial shares and the raising of new capital for Kingston Properties through an additional public offer, Burcheson expressed satisfaction with the performance of the VM Wealth IPO Edge. ""I must say that the current platform will always be upgraded. We got lots of feedback from clients from the use of the platform, and certainly for other IPOs and APOs we'll put to the marketplace, you'll see that additional functionality,"" he said. Turning to VMIL's loan management system, he said plans are in train to implement the platform to facilitate individuals borrowing against their investments. ""We are all aware that we're major players in the margin loan business. This is where persons with equity investments or other marketable securities borrow against their investments to accelerate their returns,"" the VMIL CEO explained. So far, he said, a lot of borrowing has been deployed to margin loan products and so VMIL wants to have the functionality to scale the platform. As trading in cryptocurrency and other digital assets become more prevalent, VMIL has plans to join the Jamaica Stock Exchange in trading digital assets. Burcheson, however, cautioned that to avert any volatility due to speculation, the financial institution will provide appropriate training and sensitisation in that area, ensuring investors understand the risk involved. The company will also continue to leverage social media to communicate with both local and foreign investors. ""While we use the traditional media to do that, I think we also want to leverage that channel to accelerate our message,"" he shared. "

                        ",2022-10-13,"The VM Group is taking aim at the Diaspora as it seeks to expand its membership beyond the borders of the island and provide Jamaicans living abroad with opportunities to invest in their homeland. Speaking at the launch of the Jamaica Manufacturers and Exporters Association (JMEA) Retirement Account last week at the VM Group's headquarters in Half-Way-Tree, St Andrew, VM Group chief investment officer (CIO) and head of the Strategic Investment Unit Devon Barrett said that the financial group had embarked on two road shows in London, United Kingdom, and Miami, Florida, in the past two months. While giving his remarks, he added that another road show was in train in New York, USA. ""We are actually going out there to ensure that the diaspora is served. So the VM Group is not just in Jamaica. We are much wider than just Jamaica and so, our offerings are at the end of the day…is geared towards not just the three million people here. It's geared toward the world,"" the CIO explained. Barrett was responding to charges from Minister of Industry, Investment and Commerce Senator Aubyn Hill and JMEA President John Mahfood to create the means for members of Jamaica's Diaspora to participate in investment activities in the country. In his address, Mahfood noted that Jamaicans living abroad are demanding more opportunities to invest in productive sectors and participate in the local economy. ""VM, I'm challenging you as well to make it easy for Jamaicans living abroad to sign up new brokerage accounts and to be able to do online trading. Because if you're living abroad, you know how easy it is to sign up with a broker and do trading, and if you can make it easy for Jamaicans living abroad — remember they're sending three and half billion US,"" the JMEA president stated. ""Maybe there is [US]$500 million or [US]$1 billion out there ready to come into the Jamaica Stock Exchange,"" he continued. Mahfood further argued that encouraging foreign investment is one of the ways to grow the local economy, stimulate post-pandemic recovery and ""re-energise"" Jamaican industries. The Ministry of Industry, Investment and Commerce estimates that as much as three million Jamaicans live abroad — approximately similar to the size of the country's population — and contribute US$1 billion in remittance. As part of it revised National Diaspora Policy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade has as a goal creating ""…enabling environments that optimise Diaspora investment, trade and advocacy"". Given the Diaspora's appetite for Jamaican culture, products and services, it asserts that creating a Diaspora capital markets can contribute significantly to national development by mobilising savings for investments and providing long-term alternatives to facilitate wealth creation. According to Barrett, ""What we do is invite persons to open accounts in Jamaica. So when you open an account with VM, it allows you to buy into any investment in Jamaica."" Signing up for account would not require Jamaicans abroad to travel to the country, but can be done online. Once complete, they have access to all the products and services offered by VM Group through its subsidiaries. In this regard, Barrett pointed out that VM members who have a local account can sign up for its Wealth IPO Edge and participate in initial public offerings and other capital raises on the Jamaica Stock Exchange. He noted, however, that the road shows not only highlight investments opportunities on the stock market. ""We are promoting Jamaica and opportunities in Jamaica,"" Barrett outlined adding that the events facilitate information sharing on property acquisitions, bonds and other asset classes. Still, Barrett admitted that there is a ""big expression of interest from the Diaspora, and I think that's because the stocks are performing so well"", making reference to IPOs. ""So it [JSE] has attracted the interest of persons in the Diaspora because they are hearing about what's happening in Jamaica and they want to participate,"" he added. Another investment vehicle that the VM Group and its investment arm, VM investments Limited, is hoping will gain traction is Jamaica Actus Small & Medium Enterprises Fund I (JASMEF). A pooled investment with UK-based Actus Partners and the Development Bank of Jamaica, the fund provides growth and risk capital financing to invest in high-growth SMEs in Jamaica, in addition to other investments undertaken in the Caribbean. ""It creates an opportunity for persons in Jamaica and the Diaspora to invest…So it's making the link between investor and the entity needing equity or capital,"" Barrett concluded. "

                        ",2022-10-13,"Ciboney Group Limited, the listed entity which is being promoted for sale by the Financial Sector Adjustment Company Limited (Finsac), holder of 72 per cent shareholding, needs an injection of cash to remedy a shareholder's net deficit which has been reported in the range of $6.7 million and $2.7 million between May 2022 and September 2022. A ministerial paper, which was tabled in the House of Representatives and released on Friday September 9, indicated that the company carries shareholder's net deficit of $2.7 million on balance sheet, which has therefore placed the entity in breach of Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) rules and put the company in danger of being delisted. Ciboney's audited financials for the period ending May 31, 2022 puts the deficit at $6.7 million. It is not known if majority shareholder Finsac has injected cash in the period in between. General manager of Finsac Errol Campbell told the Jamaica Observer on September 12 that the deficit can be remedied when the company which buys Ciboney injects cash. Finsac has a plan to dispose of the asset by selling it to a company which wants an easy route to listing and could access the market via the reverse takeover method. The Business Observer reached out to the JSE to check on the timeline available to remedy the shareholder balance, but no response was received up to press time. Ciboney Group Limited sold all its assets and bled itself of cash while waiting for a buyer. The listed vehicle has been advertised in the last decade by Finsac as a vehicle for any company which wants a simplified route to public listing and the benefits of traded stock. Prospective buyers will be considering the reverse takeover (RTO) process in which private companies seek to become publicly traded without going through an initial public offering (IPO). The private company needs to buy  enough shares to control the publicly traded company. The private company's shareholder then exchanges its shares and so effectively becomes publicly traded. The RTO is often called a reverse merger or a reverse IPO. Finsac has been advertising since 2015. The years have slipped by as Finsac sought  buyers for its 72 per cent stake in Ciboney Group, totalling more than 393 million shares. In October 2021, the majority shareholder asked that bids be submitted by November 8, 2021, along with company profile and the proposed business venture. In the first quarter of 2022, a buyer was identified, but the long process of approval followed by Finsac, a government agency resulted in the prospect getting away. It was explained by Ciboney's directors on June 29, 2022, in a statement released via the JSE, ""Regarding efforts by the majority shareholder to dispose of its shareholding, we have now been informed by the majority shareholder that from the offers received and following the usual due diligence exercise, a suitable prospective purchaser was identified as the preferred bidder. As required by relevant government protocols, requisite approval was sought for the sale to this preferred bidder and this has now been received. Sadly, this preferred bidder has written to the majority shareholder withdrawing its offer and also advising that it has no further interest in acquiring this asset. The directors understand further that the majority shareholder is reviewing its position and will communicate with us in due course how it proposes to move the matter forward in relation to the disposal of its shares, at which time, this information will be shared."" Campbell told the Business Observer on Monday that he would be seeking legal advice as to the way forward. Ciboney, which once operated in the tourism industry, was one of the assets taken over by Finsac under a bailout programme by the Jamaican Government in the 1990s to rescue companies in the troubled Jamaican financial sector. The company's stock traded at 0.53 cents per share on Monday, September 12, 2022, valuing the company at $297,048,570. Shares outstanding are 546,000,000 units. Finsac's  reserve price for its shareholding is unknown. "

While the company is based in Antigua and Barbuda, it also has operations in the nearby Commonwealth of Dominica. Gregory Georges, chief executive officer of the WIOC, told the Jamaica Observer that the thrust is to diversify its revenue base away from petroleum products in the immediate future was part of a business plan entitled 'Energising Transformative Growth'.  ""One of the key plans for the future is to invest in renewable energy. Obviously, fossil fuel will remain a key part [of the continuing operations], but we are certainly diversifying into renewable energy. We are now looking at the installation of a five-mega watt solar plant, as we look to sort of reduce our carbon footprint and ensure we have a sustainable future for WIOC, Antigua and the region,"" Georges explained. He declined to say what level of financing will be poured into that project, but research shows it costs between US$800,000 to $1 million per mega watt to set up a solar plant which would put that project at between US$4 million and US$5 million. ""Once we can develop solar opportunities in Antigua, we intend to expand within the region, starting off with Dominica next door, where we have already a business, and then, within the other OECS islands, and then in the wider Caribbean,"" he continued. Georges said his company is now in the process of negotiating a power purchasing agreement with the utility, ""so I won't be at liberty yet to give definitive timelines [on when the project will be implemented], but we are working to get it off fairly quickly."" But he added: ""We have a department of environment in Antigua, and we are partnering with them in terms of becoming an asset manager for some of the charging stations for electric vehicles."" He said he expects that deal to be sorted ""within a matter of months"". The WIOC, was incorporated in 1961, but didn't start operations until 1966 as a refinery before abandoning that quest in 1973 in favour of storage and distribution of petroleum products, listed on the Eastern Caribbean Securities Exchange on July 7, 2022, after raising EC$18 million in an initial public offering (IPO) which closed successfully in May 2021. It was the 14th company to list on the Eastern Caribbean Securities Exchange and the first energy company to do so. The IPO was facilitated by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda selling 10 per cent of its 51 per cent holding at the time. The funds were paid directly to the Government ""to fund various capital projects"". WIOC did not receive any of the proceeds. ""When the Government bought WIOC in 2015, under the leadership of Prime Minister Gaston Browne, his vision, his mandate, was for us to grow the business and then list it on the stock exchange."" ""We had to diversify the revenue base because the margins were quite slim on the marketing of petroleum products...The first thing we did was to invest in storage tanks. So our capacity from 2015 has gone up over three times. We had 500,000 barrels of storage in 2015, but fast forward to 2022, we've got 1.7 million barrels of storage,"" Georges told the Caribbean Business Report. ""So what our business model does, is that we lease out most of that storage to a third party, because Antigua being as small as it is, we only need about 300,000 barrels of petroleum products to satisfy our market demands. So the difference of about 1.4 million barrels are leased out to a third party which helps us to extract higher margins and higher returns for the business."" With more storage, Georges said the company was able to enter the bunkering business, supplying fuel to cruise and container ships in the eastern Caribbean. While the big plan is to enter the renewables market, Georges said the company, which operates petrol stations in Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica, is preparing to expand that service. ""We have a network of 16 service stations in Antigua and Barbuda and eight in Dominica. So right now we're sitting, looking at the whole corporate rebranding and service station upgrade. A lot of the service stations don't have the convenience stores or have stores that need to be upgraded, so we're looking at that and adding some additional amenities to some of these service stations."" Georges also said the company is looking at opening new service stations and an additional berth to improve the efficiency of moving petroleum products into and outside of Antigua. Despite expanding storage tank capacity, he also said he is looking at further expansion in that area as well. He adds: ""We recently formed a joint operation with Rubis at the airport. In our 50 years of business, we have not been a player at the airport in jet fuel, and now we are a player there."" The airport mentioned is the VC Bird International Airport in Antigua from which 15 airlines operate flights to 22 destinations. But the energy market is not the only area in which Georges is seeking to diversify revenues for WIOC. ""We are in the process of discussing with a strategic partner [about] putting a business park on some land that's adjacent to the company on what is considered 'the golden mile' in Antigua."" That is an area just outside the capital St John's where a significant amount of development is taking place, Georges explained. He said the plan is to build a 120,000-square-foot business park that will offer the latest in retail space to prospective tenants. He said all the projects have been costed but declined to get into details about the funding or the timeline citing negotiations are currently taking place. And while the entity is newly listed on the Eastern Caribbean Securities Exchange, Georges expressed a desire of seeing it being listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange as well. In 2021, the WIOC realised sales amounting to EC$332 million (US$123 million) as it continues to recover from a COVID-19-induced culling of its sales in 2020. The projection is that this year, the company's sales will exceed EC$344 million (US$127 million) with net income of EC$24 million (US$8.8 million) up from EC$17 million (US$6.2 million) in 2021. In July, the company paid out its first dividend an EC$2.03 (US$0.75) per share payout amounting to a total EC$11.928 million (US$4.4 million) to shareholders of record as of June 27, 2022. ""This is just a phenomenal story. The Government was able to take ownership of this business seven years ago. And whereas profits in the past were repatriated to a foreign owner, these profits today remain in the country and the Government is a significant beneficiary of the returns."" ""We intend to be, as I say, an energy company, not operating only within our shores, but certainly in the short to medium term regionally, and I have no doubt. The long-term plan is to grow internationally and become a conglomerate,"" he concluded. "

                        ",2022-10-13,"Investors who usually conduct their trades online or view live market data were left in a state of confusion Tuesday as the online capabilities for stock trading went down in early trading due to a system issue at the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE).  The JSE's trading hours are between 9:30 am and 1:00 pm from Monday to Friday except public holidays. Between 9:00 am and 9:30 am is defined as the pre-market where market participants are able to gauge the bid and ask orders in the queue of the stocks or other securities available on the various markets. Bid orders speak to someone's interest in buying a stock and ask orders speak to someone's interest in selling a stock. According to data compiled at 9:00 am, there were 1,347 bid orders valued at $153.04 million and 1,089 ask orders valued at $144.43 million at 9:18 am for One on One Educational Services Limited. One on One listed on the JSE last Thursday as the 100th actively listed company on the JSE in its 53-year history. The stock had halted up for three consecutive days and had closed at $2.31 on Monday, well above the $1 price for its initial public offering (IPO). When the market officially opened at 9:30 am, normal trading occurred for all other securities on the market as normal with there being a minor delay in the information being processed exactly at open. By 9:37 am, 12,101,937 shares were traded at $2.34 a share across more than 385 trades for One on One. However, at 9:42 am, the data being displayed in the queue appeared again as if the queues were still in a state of pre-market. The best bid was being displayed at $3.02 and the best ask $1.62. In total, 41,852,804 units were being displayed as traded at that point with a trading range of $2.32 to $2.35 and $97.91 million traded so far. By 9:56 am, all the queues for every security on the JSE's Jtraderpro platform were zeroed out with data still being displayed for volumes and value traded at that point in the morning. When persons checked Jtraderpro again at 10:05 am, only three bid orders at $1.30 were being displayed for One on One and six ask orders ranging from $2.50 to $3.32 were visible. When persons checked JMMB's Moneyline platform at 10:18 am, all stocks were listed as closed with no trading data being reflected for the day so far. Even Mymoneyja.com's live data feed was down by that point with the banner noting that they were experiencing issues with their data provider and that some live updates would be delayed. ""The API [application programming interface], which is what would feed to online trading, there was an issue with it. As you recognised, we sent a message to the market indicating that there was a technical difficulty that we had to speak to our provider about. The brokers who are connected using the ITCH programme for their online trading platform would have also been affected,"" said managing director of the JSE Marlene Street Forrest in a call with the Jamaica Observer on Tuesday about the market disruption. When asked about the issue, Street Forrest only indicated that it was an IT issue which impacted the JSE's API, and that the Nasdaq system was not affected. The JSE has been using the Nasdaq trading and surveillance platform under a seven-year agreement since December 2019. The JSE had sent out a release to the brokers on the trading platform and market through social media about the technical issues impacting the market. When asked if the system disruption was due to the influx of orders coming in largely for the One on One stock, Street Forrest replied, ""The IPO was last week Thursday and today is Tuesday. It's not correlated at all. It's like any other system where some of the times there might be a technical problem. It's not correlated, we have no issues with servers, our technology and storage are in the cloud and we have over abundance of capacity. We have excess capacity that can handle three times the volume and more than ten times what we're having. This is why we encourage many more companies, 100 more, to list on this market because the capacity is endless."" While market stability somewhat returned by midday, many investors described a feeling of being blind without an ability to rely on the accuracy of the data they were viewing to conduct trades. The JSE earns 0.35 per cent on every trade conducted on the JSE which means that reduced trading would have meant less income. When asked if there would have been an extension to trading hours owing to the disruption, Street Forrest said, ""Trading on the normal market was not down. We would not be in a position to extend trading because the online facility is down. The fact is that traders would not have been barred from trading because the normal facility which is calling your broker was available. We would not extend trading on that basis because there were alternative means of putting in your trades."" The JSE has extended market hours in the past when the network provider was down, and trades couldn't be conducted for a majority of the trading session. An equity trading manager, who requested anonymity, questioned if the JSE's IT and trading team would furnish a final statement to the brokers after the initial notice explaining what happened and what will be done to prevent a repeat of the event. The manager also questioned the rationale of having clients call brokers when the market has been seeing an influx of new investors in recent times. This comes at a time when some brokers have expressed dissatisfaction in the communication by the JSE and the Jamaica Central Securities Depository (JCSD). They made a note of how the JCSD made a change to the system, implemented it, and had to roll it back as no one was prepared for it. ""We did not make any specific change at all. The broker has to tell you which system change we made and what the roll-out he was talking about. We have not made any JCSD system change, not at all. The various technologies that we have work, and they work beautifully,"" Street Forrest said in response to the statement by the trading manager. In May 2013, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission had fined the Nasdaq US$10 million for its poor systems and decision-making for Facebook's IPO and secondary market trading. Exchanges in the USA have an obligation to ensure their systems, processes and contingency planning are robust to manage an IPO without disruption to the market. Queries to Financial Services Commission director responsible for securities Karene Blair about guidance surrounding stock exchanges in the digital age went unanswered up to press time. ""Technology will be down and you will have times when there is an issue. My team was very proactive in contacting the service provider and getting the online trading platform back up. I want to commend them on that,"" Street Forrest said. "

                        ",2022-10-13,"The Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) on Thursday welcomed the installment of its 100th company after the listing of One-on-One Educational Services Limited.  Managing director of the JSE Marlene Street Forrest in lauding the milestone achievement said the listing comes 53 years after the stock exchange's inception in 1969. Marking the 100th company to be listed of the 146 securities on the JSE, One-on-One is also the fifth junior company to be listed since the start of this year, ranking 46th on that exchange. ""The exchange is happy to welcome One-on-One as part of its growing family. We're really pleased to see so many entrepreneurs taking that step to come to market. One on One has joined a growing number of companies that have decided that there is value to list on the exchange and to employ equity to build out its brand,"" Street Forrest said, while touting ambitions to double the current number of companies listed on the exchange by 2025. ""There is so much we can do and we have to do it fast. The best-performing stock exchange for 2015 and 2018 is your exchange to make it what you want. ""We expect that in continuing to provide value to Jamaica, One on One will ensure real returns to its investors,"" she added. One-on-One, an e-learning services provider, after issuing an initial public offer (IPO) last month, which was oversubscribed, raised over $350 million, which it will use to fund expansion of services and drive technological advancement while catering to the needs of its over 250,000 learners across 13 countries in the Caribbean. Through the services offered, clients benefit from e-learning courses, online training, and instructional design services from expert tutors and trainers. ""We have over 13,000 shareholders in our company that we are working to serve. We have come a far way, but the work starts now as our goal right is to bring One on One from the shores of Jamaica and the Caribbean to become a global leader in online education and training all across the world,"" said a proud and elated Ricardo Allen, president and CEO of One-on-One, which trades as One on the stock market. Applauding the company for its efforts in becoming a net exporter of services for the local market, Investment Minister Aubyn Hill said he hopes for the company to grow from strength to strength as it works to strike new deals to accompany a growing number of big name clients across government, businesses, and individuals in countries across the region, some of which includes Flow, Lasco Financial, and Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC). A partnership with the Government of The Bahamas to provide online learning solutions to over 50,000 students since the novel coronavirus pandemic has also helped to push the company in earning over 80 per cent of its revenues outside of local borders. At the end of its first day of trading on Thursday, the stock advanced to close at $1.31 — 31 per cent above its opening value. Minister of Transport and Mining Audley Shaw, bringing greetings, also commended the growth of the stock exchange, noting that it has moved from listing 35 companies during the first 40 years to 65 in the last 13 years. Instrumental in championing the launch of the junior stock exchange in 2009, Shaw reiterated previous calls for the establishment of a micro stock exchange. ""There is another target that we must look at now — a micro stock exchange — where we target smaller companies. This will present another opportunity for more businesses to becsome formal, and I'll be arguing for it and promoting it at Cabinet with the prime minister and the minister of finance,"" he stated. "

                Special purpose acquisition corporations (SPACs) — What you need to know
            ",https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/special-purpose-acquisition-corporations-spacs-what-you-need-to-know/,"
                            Sep 02, 2022 12:09 am
                        ",2022-10-13,"EARLIER this year, privately held Micro-Financing Solutions Limited (MFSL) purchased 79.08 per cent of publicly traded SSL Venture Capital Limited (SSLVC) for a total consideration of $30.0 million. They did this through MFS Acquisitions Limited, a special purpose acquisition corporation (SPAC) created to facilitate the transaction. Following the acquisition, SSLVC was rebranded as MFS Capital Partners Limited as of August 18, 2022, where it now trades under the ticker ""MFS"" on the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE). The listing ceremony was held at the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) on August 25. But what is a SPAC? In more developed markets, utilising this corporate structure has been common since the 1990s. However, this is the first such entity to be created in Jamaica, a sign of Jamaica's increasing maturity as a financial destination. A SPAC is used either to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) or to takeover or merge with an existing business. It does not engage in any commercial activities. SPACs have emerged as a popular alternative for many experienced management teams and sponsors interested in taking companies public. This trend is anticipated to persist as an expanding number of private equity (PE) firms, venture capital (VC) funds, and operators form more SPACs. Although the first SPACs were established in the 1990s, it wasn't until more recently that blue-chip investors started showing particular interest in them. According to a study of data provided by Dealogic that was conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the percentage of IPOs in the United States that were made by SPACs increased to 30 per cent in 2019 from 4 per cent in 2013. The increase can be attributed to the fact that a greater number of prestigious private equity firms, banks, and high-profile entrepreneurs are forming SPACs. This, in turn, has attracted owners of private companies who are interested in taking their businesses public. For instance, big investment firms such as Pershing Square Capital Management, Goldman Sachs, and TPG Capital are among those participating in the most recent wave of SPAC offerings. SPACs can contribute to capital  One such benefit includes more access to capital because even though some smaller and medium-sized companies may not be the best candidates for traditional IPOs, they may still wish to continue funding research, investing in brand awareness, or making acquisitions in order to pursue growth. Existing enterprises can keep a share in their operation while also gaining access to liquidity that they would not have had otherwise if they merged with a sponsor for a SPAC. Another benefit that can accrue from establishing a SPAC is that of greater market certainty because stock prices are unpredictable and it can be difficult and expensive to identify the optimal time to debut on a stock exchange. A corporation runs the risk of ""leaving money on the table"" if it is overly conservative in its pricing strategy and sets the price of its offering too low. Additionally, the market may have been weak on the day the company went public, which could have a negative impact on the price of the shares. The strategy used by MFSL was a reverse take-over of SSLVC by a SPAC set up by MFSL. This marked a significant moment in Jamaica's capital markets, because transactions like this have historically been uncommon, although they are widely used in other markets. This proved that aside from the conventional IPO and other traditional ways of raising funds, alternative corporate financing solutions are available for firms that operate within the Jamaican economy, achievable by collaborating with brokers such as VM Wealth Management (VMWM) that display a high level of expertise of the stock market legislation in both its capacity as advisor and arranger for this transaction. A high level of innovation, resourcefulness, and commitment such as this is crucial for guiding firms to the next level of success in their respective industries and contribute to more efficient capital markets within our country. With a SPAC merger or acquisition, there can also be significantly less ambiguity because as part of the agreement, target companies have the ability to negotiate the price of their stock with the SPAC sponsor, in contrast to the usual initial public offerings. To put it another way, targets can ""lock in"" a price, which helps to protect the value of the asset from the volatility of the market. Other benefits from SPAC transactions include more flexible deal terms because in addition to negotiating valuation, SPACs allow target corporations to negotiate other deal terms in their favour. This could involve structuring the transaction to bring in more money through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) and adding debt or equity. SPACs also offer target companies access to experienced managers. In this way, SPACS behave much like PE firms in that a group of investors raise funds to strategically buy companies — the main difference being that the SPAC executes a public versus private offering. In summary, through diverse means, a business can arrive at its key objectives and there is no ""one size fits all"" for every firm's capital solutions. Therefore, it is important now more than ever that companies think outside the box in order to bring increased value to their stakeholders and approaching the capital markets for these solutions can prove to be an efficient way to do this. Indeed, traditional ways may be tried and true, but sometimes it can be beneficial to take a path less travelled.

The price was determined after SOCAR conducted a two-day demand forecasting from domestic and foreign institutional investors that ended Friday. It was below the lower bound of its target price ranging from 34,000 won to 45,000 won. Despite the disappointing price setting, the company decided to go ahead with the IPO slated for later this month. It is pushing to sell a total of 3.64 million new shares with a plan to raise 101.92 billion won. Of the total new shares that it will offer, 910,000 shares, or 25 percent, will be sold to retail investors via subscription that will be held Wednesday and Thursday. ""In consideration of the investors' voice and opinion, we decided to offer our stocks in an investor-friendly manner,"" SOCAR chief executive Park Jae-wook said.  There are concerns that the price band SOCAR had hoped for may have been overpriced, considering unfavorable market conditions, including investors' reduced appetite for risky assets. Global monetary tightening aimed at taming inflation has also weighed on the stock markets. SOCAR has voiced confidence that it will successfully complete the planned IPO, citing its stellar performance in the car-sharing market in recent years. With the proceeds from the IPO, SOCAR plans to increase its presence in the mobility market, expand investment in technology and buy promising mobility firms. In a related move, the company plans within this year to launch a ""super app"" that combines the existing car-sharing services with ""micromobility,"" such as electric bicycles, and platform-based parking services. Also in the second half of this year, it will test-provide a large-scale vehicle management solution to leading logistics giants, such as Hyundai Glovis Co. and Lotte Global Logistics Co.

SOCAR, established in 2011, is seeking to make a market debut later this month after going through IPO subscription Thursday and Friday this week from institutional investors and Wednesday and Thursday next week from retail investors.  It wants the IPO price to be set at between 34,000 won (US$25.60) and 45,000 won, which will help the car-sharing service provider raise up to 205 billion won.  Its market cap after the IPO will range from 1.2 trillion won to 1.6 trillion won.  SOCAR said its stellar performance in the car-sharing market will help make its IPO successful although the local IPO market has been chilly in the face of monetary tightening and a looming economic recession.  ""We are confident about SOCAR's performance this year and next year, both in expansion and profitability,"" SOCAR CEO Park Jae-wook said in a press meeting.  ""We are not sure exactly how long this upward momentum (in the car-sharing service market) will last, but we cannot miss this opportune moment. It is better to seek ways to fly high with the raised funds,"" he added. Park said SOCAR's earnings will be able to shift to the black, backed by its 79 percent market share and brand awareness that will reduce its marketing costs.  Thanks to the flourishing single-person households, people are becoming increasingly open to car-sharing, Park said.  According to SOCAR data, 64 percent of its clients are returning customers, and more than 50 percent of its users wish to keep using their SOCAR plans or delay purchases for new cars.  It holds some 19,000 cars for its service across the country. Its sales spiked 31 percent on-year to 289 billion won last year, but it suffered an operating loss of 21 billion won.  SOCAR plans to spend the proceeds from the IPO to raise its presence in the mobility market with investment in technology and the acquisition of promising mobility firms.

SK On’s IPO unlikely to take place until after 2025: SK Innovation CEO,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/sk-ons-ipo-unlikely-to-take-place-until-after-2025-sk-innovation-ceo/,"March 31, 2022",2022-10-13,"SEOUL-- SK On Co. is not considering an initial public offering (IPO) for at least another two to three years but will build up its competitiveness and enhance corporate value before pushing for a market debut, head of its parent company said Thursday.  The potential listing of SK On has drawn attention since the battery unit was spun off from SK Innovation in October last year, as part of SK's push to bolster the battery business amid growing demand from global automakers vying for a bigger share in the electric vehicle market.  ""What's the most important for an IPO to take place is that we need to have our battery business recognized in the market,"" Kim Jun, CEO and vice chairman of SK Innovation Co., told reporters after a general shareholders meeting.  ""I expect that we should be able to deliver the performance, in terms of sales, profitability and stable management of equipment, after 2025, and I believe it would be after 2025 if we were to do an IPO,"" he said. Its bigger rival, LG Energy Solution Ltd., set a record IPO in January that made the battery maker the second-largest company in South Korea by market cap, reflecting the global electrification trend.  Kim said SK On is at the pre-IPO stage to raise funds from investors in advance of going public.  ""We need large-scale resources as we are continuing with the facility expansion ... We plan to sign the contracts (on the investments) in the first half,"" Kim said.  Industry sources predict SK On is seeking to raise between 3 and 5 trillion won (US$2.47-4.12 billion), which amounts to about a 10 percent stake in the company.  Kim forecast SK On will swing to the black in the fourth quarter of this year and achieve an annual surplus from next year. SK Innovation's battery business logged an operating loss of 683.1 billion won in the fourth quarter of last year.  In light of any possible advance into new businesses, Kim said he is looking at areas of ""non-carbon, or low-carbon energy sources,"" and discussing various ideas with SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, without elaborating further.  Earlier this month, Chey hinted at ""drawing up a new business map that incorporates energy and environment"" during a visit to a SK Innovation factory in a southwestern city.

"Money raised through IPOs hits record high in 2021 amid ample liquidity, bullish sentiment",https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/money-raised-through-ipos-hits-record-high-in-2021-amid-ample-liquidity-bullish-sentiment/,"February 7, 2022",2022-10-13,"SEOUL– The amount of money South Korean firms raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) more than quadrupled to hit a record high last year thanks to ample liquidity and the overall bullish stock market sentiment, data showed Monday. A total of 89 companies went public in 2021 by listing stocks on the benchmark KOSPI and secondary tech-heavy KOSDAQ markets and raised a combined 19.7 trillion won (US$16.4 billion), according to the data from the Financial Supervisory Service. The money raised from IPOs represented a 333.9 percent surge from 4.5 trillion won a year earlier, the data showed. The number of companies whose shares listed on the stock markets for the first time also jumped from the previous year’s 70. The IPO market was driven by the overall rise in local stock markets and ample liquidity injected into the economy bolstered by low borrowing costs in line with record low policy rates intended to boost the pandemic-hit economy. Investors got more interested in new stock listings, with the competition ratio for IPO stocks jumping to an average of 1,136 to 1 last year, up from the 956-to-1 ratio a year earlier. The prices of newly listed stocks closed 57.4 percent higher on average on their first trading day, compared with their IPO prices. The return marked the highest in five years, the data showed. Their average prices also jumped 54.8 percent at the end of last year from the IPO prices. But of the companies that went private, 28 firms, or 31.5 percent, saw their stocks fall below the IPO prices at the end of last year, the data showed. Source: Yonhap News Agency "

حيث ستطرح الشركة 40 في المائة من رأسمالها للجمهور من خلال الاكتتاب العام. وبناءً على ذلك، ستطرح الشركة 30,208,800 سهم للجمهور من خلال الإدراج في بورصة مسقط. وكمستثمرين مؤسسين رئيسيين في الاكتتاب العام الأولي، إلتزمت كل من الشركة الوطنية للطاقة والمياه ش.م.م، وهي الذراع الاستثمارية لمجموعة بهوان الهندسية وشركة بنك مسقط  ش.م.ع.ع باستثمار ما يصل إلى 10٪ لكل مستثمر من حجم الاكتتاب عند قيمة 145 بيسة للسهم الواحد والذي هو أعلى قيمة في نطاق السعري للإكتتاب العام الأولي هذا.  وقد أسس شركة بركاء لتحلية المياه شركات عالمية رائدة وتتمتع بخبرة واسعة في صناعة المياه تشمل: مؤسسة أيتوشو من اليابان، وإنجي وسويز من فرنسا بالإضافة إلى مجموعة دبليو جي تاول من عُمان. تلبي شركة بركاء لتحلية المياة احتياجات حوالي 20٪ من الطلب على المياه في سلطنة عمان. تعد المحطة المملوكة للشركة والمزودة بتقنية تحلية المياه المثبتة أحد الأصول الاستراتيجية الواقعة بالقرب من محافظة مسقط، وبالتالي فهي الوحدة الرئيسية لإمدادات المياه للمحافظة والجزء الشمالي من السلطنة.تحقق الشركة إيراداتها من خلال اتفاقية شراء المياه المتعاقد عليها لمدة 20 عامًا حتى عام 2038 مع الشركة العمانية لشراء الطاقة والمياه المملوكة للحكومة العمانية، مما يضمن تدفقات نقدية مستقرة ويمكن التنبؤ بها. واستناداً إلى اتفاقية شراء المياه المتعاقد عليه، تخطط الشركة لطرح الأسهم في الاكتتاب العام الأولي على أساس بناء سجل الأوامر بنطاق سعر يتراوح ما بين 115 بيسة إلى 145 بيسة، وهو ما يترجم إلى عائد توزيعات جذابة بنسبة تتراوح ما بين 8.4٪ إلى 10.6٪

الشرب عالية الجودة مع استهلاك قياسي منخفض للطاقة الكهربائية. حققت المحطة أداءً تشغيليًا ممتازًا مع موثوقية تزيد عن 99٪ في الاثني عشر شهرًا المنصرمة. ومن الجدير بالذكر أن المحطة تستخدم وحدات تقنية تعويم الهواء المذاب ""SeaDAFTM"" التي تساعدها على توفير المياه حتى أثناء ظاهرة انتشار وتراكم الطحالب، حيث تواجه محطات تحلية المياه الأخرى في عُمان عادةً تعقيدات تقنية فيما يتعلق بتشغيل محطاتها.سيكون

									Kakao Bank, Krafton employees feel pain of bear market								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20221012000679&ACE_SEARCH=1,12-10-2022,2022-10-13,"
 A KakaoBank logo is seen next to a Kakao Friends character. (KakaoBank)Amid the white-hot stock rally of 2021, they were the envy of all.Those working at the year’s biggest market debutants Krafton and Kakao Bank were given chances to buy stocks in their company at a set price, via employee share ownership plans.However, none of those who bought the employee stocks are seeing profits now, as the shares are currently trading at less than half the price they paid.On Blind, an anonymous workplace community app, a verified Kakao Bank employee revealed a loss of 400 million won ($280,164) in his employee stock investment.“(Kakao Bank workers) are at risk of becoming credit delinquents,” the user wrote.""People at the company borrowed every single penny from friends and family members (to buy as many employer stocks as possible) because we were so certain about the stock’s return prospects.”Another post spoke of how the office atmosphere has recently gone from cheerful around the time of its initial public offering last year to gloomy.Kakao Bank, a mobile banking arm of Kakao, made last year’s second biggest IPO, raising 2.55 trillion won on its August, 2021 listing on Korea’s main Kospi bourse.Shares of the company closed at 17,750 won on Wednesday, less than half of the IPO price of 39,000 won.Kakao Bank employees have purchased 12.74 million shares, some 19.5 percent of the total offerings. This translates into an average of 12,500 shares per employee, worth 490 million won at the time of purchase.The situation at Krafton appears to be similar.Its once-envied employee share ownership plan has turned into a nightmare.Krafton was the star of last year’s IPO market, raising a whopping 4.3 trillion won in August. It was the biggest share listing in Korea last year and the second-biggest in the country’s capital market history.Employees at the game firm have acquired 4.1 percent of the total offer, or 351,525 shares, at 498,000 won apiece. This translates into an average of 264 shares per employee and a per-capita investment of 131.47 million won.Krafton’s stock closed at 180,500 won Wednesday, sharply down from the IPO price.Both Kakao Bank and Krafton employee stockholders were not able to divest their investments while they were making profit due to a one-year lock-up.Kakao Bank stock recorded an all-time high of 94,400 won on Aug. 20, 2021, soon after the listing. Krafton stocks peaked at 580,000 on Nov. 17, 2021. The lock-up period expired in August this year for both.The loss is only on paper, unless realized. But employees who have used leverage for the investment are left with a choice between two undesirable options – selling with a great loss or enduring the time of rising interest rates in hope of a turnaround one day.Worse off are those who have taken on securities-based loans. As the value of the equity continues to fall, they face forced liquidation. To avoid that, additional collateral must be provided.On Oct. 7, Kakao Bank CEO Yoon Ho-young said the company would review a set of shareholder return policies, including buybacks.""We will actively review shareholder return policies, such as share buyback or share retirement, by the time the 2022 account settlement is approved at a shareholder meeting,"" Yoon said in an internal message sent to employees.Early this year, Krafton founder and board chairman Chang Byung-gyu reportedly spent 30 billion won buying company stocks in what appears to be a failed attempt to help boost their market value.On Wednesday, Korea Investment & Securities slashed its target price for Krafton shares to 270,000 won per share. The same brokerage had suggested 580,000 won for the stock in August 2021. By Park Han-na (hnpark@heraldcorp.com)

									Kurly’s IPO plan to be decided next week								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220816000788&ACE_SEARCH=1,16-8-2022,2022-10-13,"
The corporate logo of Kurly (Kurly)The long-awaited market debut of Kurly, operator of South Korean e-commerce platform Market Kurly, is expected to be decided soon as the nation’s bourse operator is scheduled to hold a final review session next week, according to industry sources on Tuesday. If the company gets a green light from the Korea Exchange during the session, it is ready to go public. Following a book building process, its share price will be decided. The issue is investor sentiment amid a lukewarm initial public offering market this year. A Kurly official told The Korea Herald that it is “too early to tell” whether the company should consider withdrawing its IPO.“Pending on the results of the final review, we will decide when will be the best time to get listed,” the official added.Although Kurly filed for the review procedure five months ago, the Korea Exchange had expressed concerns about the possibility of its founder’s dwindling control over the firm. Kim Seul-ah, Kurly’s CEO and founder, is the company’s sixth-largest shareholder with a tiny 5.75 percent stake, while more than half the shares are owned by foreign investors, notably Chinese funds such as SCC Growth V Holdco H, Ltd and HH Sum-xi Holdings Limited.The Korea Exchange said the company might face a series of exits from shareholders or hostile mergers and acquisitions because Kim does not hold enough shares to protect her management rights.As per the bourse operator’s request, most of Kurly’s financial investors turned in affirmation documents last month stating that they will not sell their shares before 18 months after the IPO. They also promised to hold a joint voting rights session when selling more than 20 percent of their shares.In order to diversify its business portfolio, the company has announced that it will launch a marketplace service, acting as an intermediary between home appliance providers and buyers starting next month. It also recently began exporting ready-made foods to Singapore.But industry insiders say Kurly might not receive a fair valuation from the market, falling short of its expected corporate value of some 4 trillion won-5 trillion won ($3.1 billion-$3.8 billion).“Currently it is not the best timing for an IPO. So I don’t think Kurly will reach 4 trillion won in valuation,” said Seo Yong-ku, a business professor at Sookmyung Women‘s University. “The company will have to work hard to successfully make an appeal to institutional investors with its value-adding business plan.”Car-sharing platform SoCar, which recently completed its book building process, had to lower its IPO price, decreasing its estimated corporate value from 1 trillion won to 966.5 billion won.Rival e-commerce platforms such as SSG.com have postponed their IPOs to next year. Oasis, which said it plans to go public this year, has yet to start the process due to the IPO market downturn.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

									SoCar IPO faces lukewarm response from investors								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220807000174&ACE_SEARCH=1,7-8-2022,2022-10-13,"
SoCar CEO Park Jae-wook speaks during a press conference at Conrad Seoul in Yeouido, Seoul on Aug. 3. (SoCar)Amid dampened appetite for initial public offerings, South Korean car-sharing company SoCar is facing lukewarm response from institutional investors, with a growing possibility that it may join this year’s long list of market debut flops.According to industry sources, during the two-day book building period on Thursday and Friday, institutional investors had written their preferred share price below 34,000 won ($26), lower than the price band of 34,000 won-45,000 won suggested by the company.The company plans to float 4.55 million shares, aiming for a market capitalization of between 1.2 trillion won and 1.6 trillion won.Following the book building results, which will be announced Tuesday, SoCar can either lower its IPO price and go public, or withdraw its application for a market debut on the benchmark Kospi. The company is scheduled to launch its IPO for retail investors on Aug. 10 and 11 with Mirae Asset Securities as the main underwriter.In addition to the dramatic slowdown of IPO market, the car-sharing platform’s IPO pitch has raised concerns of overvaluation here.When setting the preferred share price, SoCar selected three companies -- GoTo, Ovigo and Aurora -- although it shares little similarities in terms of business portfolios, as major peer groups.GoTo’s 37 percent of sales is generated through e-commerce transactions and both Ovigo and Aurora profit from offering a smart car software platform and self-driving solutions.But more than 97 percent of SoCar’s first-quarter sales revenue came from short-term rentals -- even several hours.Industry insiders pointed out that the company left out any car rental companies like SK Rent-a-Car and Lotte Rental from the peer group in order to receive a higher valuation.SoCar CEO Park Jae-wook said at Wednesday’s press conference, “Unlike car rental firms who make profit through selling used cars, we are the only mobility company that operates both car-sharing services and a mobility software business.”“Also, not only have we last year surpassed global mobility platforms in terms of pre-tax profits, but will be the first mobility company in the world to turn a profit starting this year,” Park added.Sources say companies will have to set their preferred share prices more conservatively if they wish to make a successful debut on the sluggish market.Compared to the record-breaking IPOs during the last two years, major companies that had planned to get listed ditched IPO plans this year due to fears of undervaluation.Hyundai Oilbank, whose market value was worth 10 trillion won, scrapped its IPO plan before the book building, citing that it is difficult to receive fair value estimate from the current market.Hyundai Engineering, SK Shieldus and One Store withdrew its IPO application after failing to convince less-than-impressed institutional investors.CJ Oliveyoung, one of the country’s leading beauty retailers, also indefinitely postponed its market debut, before even applying for a preliminary review with the Korea Exchange.Upcoming listings of major IPOs scheduled this year include the e-commerce platform Market Kurly, which is expected to reach around 2-6 trillion won. Others include K-Bank, an internet-only bank, and Golfzon County, a golf course operator, receiving value estimates of 6-8 trillion won and 2 trillion won, respectively.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

SoCar CEO Park Jae-wook speaks during a press conference at Conrad Seoul in Yeouido, Seoul. (SoCar)South Korean car-sharing company SoCar said Wednesday it planned to debut in the nation‘s benchmark Kospi to expand its footing in the mobility industry worth 350 trillion won (267.6 billion) and growing.The company will decide soon whether to float 4.55 million shares or not on Aug. 22 after testing the water with the two-day preliminary proceedings scheduled on Thursday and Friday. The preferred share price is set between 34,000 won and 45,000 won. The main underwriter is Mirae Asset Securities.“We will use 60 percent of the IPO funds to acquire startups including self-driving tech companies, 20 percent to boost mobility software, electric bicycle and parking business, and the remaining 20 percent to invest in research and development of innovative technologies,” said Park Jae-wook, SoCar CEO, during a press conference.Park said the SoCar app will start providing reservation services for the high-speed KTX train by this year and even electric bicycle-sharing and car parking services in the near future.The company is also gearing up to enter the global mobility market with its Fleet Management System, which monitors and compiles data including car mileage, location, and performance indicators on engines, batteries and vehicle consumables.Domestic players like Hyundai Glovis, a supply chain management arm under Hyundai Motor Group, and Lotte Global Logistics, logistic firm under the retail giant Lotte Group, have already signed deals to adopt SoCar’s software system.SoCar also plans to expand self-driving service to regions other than Jeju Island.Park stressed that as the first mobility Unicorn in Korea, SoCar has taken a more-than 79 percent share of the domestic car-sharing market. It operates more than 19,000 cars and 4,500 car-sharing zones in the metropolitan region and other major cities such as Daejeon, Busan, Daegu and Gwangju.“Despite the coronavirus pandemic, our sales revenue has increased on-year by 31.2 percent and 35.3 percent last year and the first half of 2022, respectively,” said Park. “In terms of profit before tax, we posted minus 0.9 percent, surpassing that of global mobility giants like Grab, Uber and GoTo, which logged minus 153 percent to minus 17 percent.”Park said the company was expected to turn a profit this year based on improving business efficiency and the growing number of paid membership users. “Although we are buying more cars to meet the growing demand for car-sharing, margin per car is increasing. The 162,000 membership users frequently use our service, becoming the key source of surge in sales as well.”Park added that despite the dramatic slowdown of IPO market, he expects SoCar to receive a high valuation thanks to its profit-generating business portfolios and the fast-growth of the mobility market.“Also, the second and third largest shareholders, SK Inc. and Lotte Rental signed a deal not to sell their shares during the lock-up period of six months after the IPO,” Park said.Founded in 2011, SoCar provides car-sharing, electric bicycle-sharing and parking services. Last year, it sold a 60 percent stake in Tada, the company’s mobility platform subsidiary, to the fintech giant Toss.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

(Hyundai Oilbank)Hyundai Heavy Industries Group’s refining affiliate Hyundai Oilbank has withdrawn its application for an initial public offering with local bourse operator Korea Exchange, the firm said Thursday.The decision, which was reached Wednesday, comes after a general evaluation of the recent stock market conditions and stock price trend of other refineries, according to Hyundai Oilbank.“In the current market situation where it is difficult to be recognized properly by our excellent performance, we judged that there is no reason to push for IPO anymore,” a Hyundai Oilbank official said in a statement.The oil refiner earned a record revenue of 20.6 trillion won ($15.7 billion) last year, up 50.5 percent on-year, and an operating profit of 1.14 trillion won, backed by rising oil demand.But with South Korean stocks dipping over fears of a global recession, increased interest rates and economic headwinds ahead, other companies such as Hyundai Engineering and SK Shieldus that filed for an IPO this year have also backed out.“Although we have decided not to continue with the IPO plan, we will continue to invest in future businesses such as petrochemical materials, biofuels and hydrogen and also work on improving our financial structure,” Hyundai Oilbank said.Hyundai Oilbank filed for an initial public offering last December — the third of its kind after the refiner suspended the IPO process in 2012 and in 2019.By Hong Yoo (yoohong@heraldcorp.com)

									Kyobo, Affinity on blame game over IPO rejection								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220718000664&ACE_SEARCH=1,18-7-2022,2022-10-13,"
Kyobo Life Insurance headquarters in Seoul. (Kyobo Life Insurance)South Korea’s Kyobo Life Insurance and its second-largest shareholder -- a consortium led by Affinity Equity Partners -- are blaming each other for its recent failure to carry out an initial public offering. The blame game follows the nation’s sole bourse operator Korea Exchange’s decision on July 8 to reject an initial public offering by Kyobo, without citing a reason. Market watchers, however, cited Kyobo’s yearslong legal dispute with the consortium led by the Hong Kong-based private equity firm behind the KRX’s latest move. “Our IPO plan was canceled because of Affinity’s disruption,” Kyobo said in a statement released Friday. “Affinity must cooperate as two-thirds of our shareholders have agreed with our IPO plan,” it added. As of end-2021, Kyobo CEO Shin Chang-jae and related parties stood as the insurer’s largest shareholder with 36.91 percent, while the consortium led by Affinity held a 9.05 percent stake, making it the second-largest shareholder. Other notable shareholders include Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan with a 7.62 percent stake, the Korea Export-Import Bank with 5.85 percent and a consortium led by local private equity firm IMM PE with 5.23 percent. Affinity refused to back down and released a statement on the same day saying that, “All faults and responsibilities for Kyobo’s IPO failure is with its CEO Shin who has failed to uphold his side of the bargain among shareholders.”At the core of the dispute lies Kyobo and Affinity’s failure to get on the same page about the insurer’s IPO price. Kyobo has expressed its desire to set its IPO price based on the current market conditions, while Affinity has been calling for the price to be set at 409,912 won ($311.41) per share based on the put option agreement signed with the Korean insurer in 2012. The consortium claims that the 2012 put option contract obligates Shin to buy out its shares unless he had succeeded in floating the company by 2015. But no initial public offering has yet to take place. In October 2018, the consortium exercised the option. But Shin refused to buy out the shares, citing the exorbitant price of 409,912 won per share. The International Chamber of Commerce intervened at the group’s request, but the two parties have yet to settle their differences. A tribunal, which has already said the contract itself remains valid, is now asked to rule on how the two should set the price, though the decision is not expected anytime soon.Kyobo Life had been seeking to complete an IPO within the first half of this year to diversify its funding sources to brace for the adoption of a new accounting rule for insurance products here in 2023. Its second IPO application was filed in December.(mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

									Kakao Mobility at crossroads amid sell-off rumors								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220710000080&ACE_SEARCH=1,10-7-2022,2022-10-13,"
A couple of taxis using Kakao Mobility’s ride-hailing service Kakao T wait for passengers in front of Seoul station on June 28. (Yonhap)A dispute between Kakao Corp. management and its labor union is growing over the IT giant’s rumored attempt to sell its transportation service subsidiary Kakao Mobility to private equity firm MBK Partners. Kakao’s labor union on Wednesday accused the management of giving up on its mobility business, questioning if the sell-off to the private equity fund can help the business grow.According to the union’s statement, Kakao Corp. said its mobility platform cannot grow anymore under its wing, and that the IT giant has no intention of continuing with the mobility business. It added that Kakao’s management said the sale was necessary for the business to expand. The union sees the sale of Kakao Mobility as an attempt to prevent Kakao founder Kim Beom-su from being asked to appear at the National Assembly’s state audit this year. It said it would resume collecting signatures from Kakao Corp. employees for a petition, which was launched in June when rumors of a sale first began swirling, to oppose the deal. Shortly after the union’s statement was released, Bae Jae-hyun, the company’s chief investment officer, downplayed the sale rumors. He said in an internal notice that the company has never considered an entire sell-off.“What we are considering is changing Kakao’s stake in (Kakao Mobility) to become the second-largest shareholder by selling (a 10-19 percent stake),” he said. This suggests MBK would also buy shares from other owners to become the largest shareholder. Kakao Corp. owns a 57.5 percent stake in Kakao Mobility while a consortium led by US private equity firm TPG holds a 29 percent stake and the Carlyle Group has a 6.2 percent stake.The CIO added that the company is contemplating how Kakao Mobility can grow bigger beyond Kakao Corp.’s boundaries, saying no decisions had been made. The union last month met with the IT giant’s leadership including Kim Sung-su, chairman of the board of directors, to oppose the sale.Kakao Mobility went into turmoil after June 14 when it was reported that MBK Partners -- one of the largest private equity firms in Asia -- was in talks with the IT giant to buy a 40 percent stake in Kakao Mobility, which was valued at 8.5 trillion won ($6.6 billion).   Despite Kakao Corp.’s explanation that nothing was decided at the time, the sudden news sparked outcry from employees, as the company even had picked underwriters in March to go public on the Korea Exchange this year. Kakao’s labor union then began collecting signatures of employees and staged protests to oppose the sale of Kakao Mobility. The union denounced Kakao Corp.’s leadership for reneging on its promise to undergo an initial public offering. Previous IPOs of Kakao subsidiaries have included stock options for employees.Prospects of a stock listing have faded due to weak market conditions and damage to the corporation’s image after Kakao Pay executives dumped shares in the company in December last year. The executives, including Ryu Young-joon, CEO of Kakao Corp.’s mobile payment unit, exercised their stock options to sell company shares only a month after Kakao Pay’s listing, reaping a windfall of almost 90 billion won.“Kakao pulled out the sell-off card just three months after it had vowed to carry out shareholder-friendly policies. Isn’t the company trying to retrieve its investment in a different way as the option of going public is likely blocked?” said the union. A staffer at one of Kakao Corp.’s subsidiaries told The Korea Herald that Kakao Mobility employees have been feeling “uneasy” as the direction of the company is now unclear. “We don’t know too much about what’s going on with the rumored sell-off. We just hope things become clear soon,” said the staffer who requested anonymity. Kakao Corp. is under pressure to resolve things one way or another, as an IPO this year was among the conditions of the minority shareholders’ investments in Kakao Mobility. It is almost certain that there would be penalty clauses for failing to list, such as a requirement to buy back shares at an elevated price or to engage in a joint sale to a third party.But with the stock market in freefall, MBK Partners will be in no hurry to complete the acquisition, according to an analyst at a local private equity firm. “The value of technology stocks has decreased, so I think it is unlikely (for MBK Partners) to buy (Kakao Mobility) at the value of 8.5 trillion won. MBK Partners has no reason to go for that price at the moment,” he said. The analyst noted that MBK Partners will also consider tag-along rights of TPG and the Carlyle Group during negotiations with Kakao Corp. Tag-along rights allow minority shareholders to sell their shares if a majority shareholder is negotiating a stake sale. If MBK Partners were to acquire a 40 percent stake from Kakao Corp. as well as all shares owned by TPG and the Carlyle Group, it would approximately cost 6.4 trillion won. “Such a large deal could put some burden on MBK Partners, so won’t they try to push the price further down?” the analyst said. Since the second half of last year, Kakao Mobility has been under fire for hiking ride-hailing fees and expanding into new business areas to provide designated driver services, quick delivery and parcel delivery. The mobility application operator faced heat from the public as its expanded services drove small merchants and business owners out of work.  An IT industry source told The Korea Herald that the sale of Kakao Mobility could give Kakao Corp. some breathing room. “Kakao’s public image has worsened over the past year and Kakao Mobility was one of the major reasons behind that. So I think Kakao might want to detach itself from the mobility business. If a deal is made, it would give Kakao instant cash,” the source said. After Kakao Mobility began as a spinoff subsidiary from Kakao Corp. in 2017, it quickly became the country’s largest mobility platform service provider. Kakao Mobility has 30 million cumulative users and 10 million monthly active users, as of July.The company recorded annual sales of 546 billion won last year, almost doubling from 2020, and posted operating profits of 12.5 billion won to be in the black for the first time.By Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)

									[Newsmaker] Internet-only banks lure customers with Tamagotchi-like savings accounts, digital piggy banks								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220701000469&ACE_SEARCH=1,1-7-2022,2022-10-13,"
Advertisement for Toss Bank`s savings account(Toss Bank)Saving money is never fun. But when combined with a digital pet that grows alongside the size of your savings, it can be more motivating. South Korea’s three internet-only banks -- KakaoBank, K bank and Toss Bank -- have launched unique products such as Tamagotchi-like savings accounts, mobile joint accounts and digital piggy banks to lure customers attracted to the trends. Toss Bank, launched in October last year, has registered 3.6 million users in just eight months through a slew of unique savings products and digital-friendly services. One of them is a Tamagotchi-like savings account in which a user can see a randomly selected digital pet -- turtle, octopus, colt or ghost -- grow with deposits for six months. The digital pet idea has been met with booming demand, as Toss opened 100,000 new accounts within 72 hours of its launch on June 14. Users can deposit a maximum 1 million won ($773) per month for a total of six months with a yield of 3 percent. “The act of saving money requires time and patience, and we wanted to change that time into a fun experience of raising a cute pet for our users,” Toss Bank CEO Hong Min-take told reporters at a media event in Seoul on Tuesday. Toss Bank also plans to launch a joint mobile account “soon,” Hong added, which will cater to friends and groups seeking to split the bill for their favorite activities. The nation’s No. 1 internet-only bank by users, KakaoBank -- with 19.13 million users -- has rolled out various accounts and services tied to its sister company and top mobile messenger KakaoTalk. In this sense, 11.39 million users had opened one of its joint accounts as of May. KakaoTalk currently has some 45 million monthly active users in a country of about 51 million.Its short-term 26-week savings account, a rare product here, was met with high demand upon its launch on June 21, registering 150,000 new accounts within 72 hours. The bank’s piggy bank services are also a key product, allowing users to make deposits of less than 1,000 won on its mobile account daily. The bank managed some 4.35 million piggy bank accounts as of the end of April. K bank is somewhat behind its two rivals in providing unique services, but it is the only mobile bank here providing a real-name account for cryptocurrency trading. Its partnership with local crypto exchange Upbit, signed in June 2020, has helped more than triple its users from 2.19 million in 2020 to some 7 million as of end-2021. K bank’s initial public offering plans, which have been stalled for years, have been gaining pace with the firm filing for a preliminary review for listing on the Korean market with the Korea Exchange on Thursday. Its IPO is predicted to be valued at at least 6 trillion won and the firm is forecast to debut in November, according to market watchers. Korea’s internet-only banks have been expanding quickly in recent years, backed by an increase in the use of smartphones and keeping traditional lenders on their toes with user-friendly services. KakaoBank’s earnings jumped about 80 percent on-year in 2021, with net income amounting to 204.12 billion won, according to a regulatory filing. Operating profit more than doubled over the cited period to 256.94 billion won, and sales also expanded 32.4 percent on-year to 1.06 trillion won.K bank recorded a net profit of 22.4 billion won last year, swinging into the black from a net loss of 105.4 billion won the previous year. Toss Bank, being relatively new to the market, has yet to release its earnings. Its total loans stood at some 4 trillion won as of last month, with 36 percent being taken out by low- and mid-rated customers.(mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

									Kakao Pay employees each lose W20m over stock dip								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220612000131&ACE_SEARCH=1,12-6-2022,2022-10-13,"
(Kakao Pay)Kakao Pay employees who own shares in their own company each lost an average 20 million won ($15,600) due to the mobile payment firm’s stock price plunge since January, reports said Sunday. The company’s employee stock ownership association purchased a total 3.4 million shares in Kakao Pay at the price of 90,000 won per share prior to its initial public offering on Nov. 3 last year, according to a regulatory filing. Documents show that some 800 employees received an average 4,005 shares each, valued at 360.4 million won at the time of the firm’s market debut. It had set the IPO price at 90,000 won per share, opened at the price of 180,000 won and closed higher at 193,000 won on its first day.But Kakao Pay employees have each lost some 20 million won after the company’s share price plunged over a slew of risks since January, the reports said. The mobile payment operator hit a 52-week-low in terms of closing price on Friday with 85,100, closing 3.73 percent lower from the previous session.Kakao Pay shares lost its rally after it was found in January that former CEO Ryu Young-joon and seven other executives offloaded 90 billion won of company shares by exercising stock option in December, only a month after the company went public. Furthermore, the firm’s second-largest shareholder Alipay dumped 5 million shares -- about 10 percent of the total stake it holds in Kakao Pay -- in a block deal, sending the payment platform operator’s price down 15.57 percent from the previous closing to 89,500 won on Wednesday. Alipay remains the second-largest shareholder, with a 34.72 percent stake in the Korean firm. Members of Kakao Pay’s employee stock ownership association are legally obligated to keep their shares until Nov. 3 this year, a year since the firm’s IPO launch. (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

									[Market Eye] Kakao share prices stall as company struggles to regain public trust								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220608000878&ACE_SEARCH=1,8-6-2022,2022-10-13,"
Graphs showing the change in stock price for Kakao, Kakao Pay and KakaoBank (The Korea Herald)Kakao Pay shares tumbled Wednesday morning after it was reported that its second-largest shareholder Alipay was looking to sell 5 million shares -- about 10 percent of the total stake it holds in Kakao Pay -- in a block deal. The stock price of Kakao Pay fell 15.57 percent to close at 89,500 won. Despite the sell-off, the payment arm of IT giant Kakao said Alipay will continue to be a strategic investor and remain the second-largest shareholder, with 34.72 percent of Kakao Pay shares, and the two sides will carry on with their strong partnership. Experts, however, said this could be the beginning of an ugly turn of events. An analyst at a local securities firm told The Korea Herald that the risk of overhang remains with Alipay’s block deal. “Alipay holds a lot more Kakao Pay shares, so it could sell some of the remaining amount or more. This possibility of dumping off shares has a negative impact for other shareholders as it was seen in today’s price drop,” the analyst said. Park Sang-hyun, an insight provider at independent investment research network Smartkarma, pointed out that Alipay’s return on its Kakao Pay investment is 10 times, so it may be natural to realize a profit to some extent. “But the local market believes that the strategic partnership is cracking, starting with this stake sale. It is highly likely that Alipay will go through a multiphased stake sale process,” Park added. The sharp drop in Kakao Pay’s stock price marked the latest hiccup in a series of disappointments for Kakao Group in the past nine months.In June 2021, Kakao Group became South Korea’s fifth-largest business group in terms of market capitalization at 79.3 trillion won ($65.1 billion), behind the country’s traditional conglomerates: Samsung, SK, LG and Hyundai Motor Group. About a month later, Kakao founder Kim Beom-su was ranked as the richest person in the country by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His net worth was estimated at $13.4 billion. The report said Kim was an exemplary case of how a self-made entrepreneur could succeed in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, which has long been dominated by its family-controlled conglomerates.The tech giant, which rose to prominence with its messenger app KakaoTalk, climbed up the ladder through aggressive expansion of businesses. At the end of the first half of 2021, Kakao had over 150 subsidiaries and affiliates in and out of the country. However, the platform behemoth’s heyday did not last long. The company -- once touted for the legendary tale of its self-made entrepreneur founder and the success of technological innovation in the 21st century -- has undergone a series of blunders and setbacks in recent months. In September, Kakao’s people-friendly image first faced criticism over the company’s rapid expansion, said to have driven small merchants out of business. That led to Kakao’s pledge to pull back some of the company’s services in industries such as snacks and flower delivery.To avert public criticism, Kakao vowed to create a fund of 300 billion won to support small firms and the self-employed, but its misfortunes continued.In the same month, the founder’s investment company K Cube Holdings -- the de facto holding company of Kakao -- was accused of having private interests as well as the illegal succession of family members in employment. More allegations piled on, as K Cube Holdings was accused of fabricating regulatory documents.Kim later apologized at a National Assembly state audit, saying the investment company would change to be committed to social responsibilities.A series of megasized initial public offering deals that further raised Kakao’s market profile, ironically, exposed the root cause for its downfall.A mass sale of Kakao Pay shares by executives including Ryu Young-joon, the then-appointee for Kakao’s next co-CEO, struck the company hard in January.Ryu, who was CEO of Kakao’s mobile payment unit Kakao Pay, was found to have exercised his stock option to sell company shares in December, only a month after the company’s listing. Through this, he and several senior executives collected a total profit of almost 90 billion won, with Ryu taking about half of the gains. Kakao saw fierce backlash from the company’s labor union, retail investors and the general public as the executives raked in massive profits at the expense of investors. Combined with the group’s hasty expansion that had hit small businesses last year, the irresponsible money-making decision raised concerns over whether the IT group could maintain accountable corporate governance. Kakao released an apology, vowing to ban CEOs and executives at its subsidiaries from selling company shares within one to two years after being listed on the market through setting up a new control tower. In March, Kim resigned from his chairman post of the board of directors, leaving behind ailing stock prices and loss of trust among investors.   Kakao’s stock price, which hit as high as 169,500 won per share at the close of June 23, 2021, has halved to a little over 80,000 won per share almost a year later. The stock prices of Kakao Pay and KakaoBank have also suffered similar or worse downfalls, losing trillions of won in the process. On top of losing confidence from the market, the IT giant has irked its own crew.Last week, Kakao unveiled its new “metaverse” working system where employees could basically work wherever they want. The seemingly future-oriented scheme, however, was met with internal resistance from employees, as the new system would require being connected online through a voice channel at all times. Kakao workers expressed concerns and discontent on an in-house online community space, saying the new policy was as an attempt to spy on employees. Kakao CEO Namkoong Whon later said in an announcement to staff that being connected to the voice channel would be decided by crew members in different groups or work areas, but did not scrap the plan. Regarding the implementation of a mandatory working time from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., he said the company will reconsider the plan through communication with staff. Without working on mending ties with stakeholders in and out of the company, Kakao instead unveiled its new vision, “Kakao Universe,” on Tuesday, saying it wants to go beyond Korea. The CEO said they will look to reach 5 billion people across the world through open links that connect them based on their interests instead of targeting South Korea’s 50 million domestic users. But if Kakao cannot redeem itself as the people-friendly company it once was with the rise of its dominant messenger app, experts say it will be difficult for the company to win back people’s hearts and bounce back. “I think Kakao’s stock prices are not doing well due to its subsidiaries going public. Naver has only one entity in the bourse, but Kakao’s other firms have been listed and this has cemented Kakao’s image as a firm that conducts (IPOs) to sell shares to make money,” an analyst at a local private equity firm told The Korea Herald. “Kakao’s growth has been done through mergers and acquisitions, as well as some unethical moves such as taking the business of small merchants. Its corporate governance is also seemingly abominable,” he added.By Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)

Corporate logo of Millie’s Library (Millie’s Library)Millie’s Library, one of South Korea’s largest e-book subscription platform, said Sunday that it is set for a market debut by the end of this year.The company filed a preliminary prospectus on Friday stating that it will offer 2 million common shares out of the total 8,234,901 shares. If the initial public offering process goes as planned, it will be the country’s first e-book platform to go public.Its shares are poised to start trading on the Korea Exchange’s secondary Kosdaq. The lead manager of the envisioned IPO is Mirae Asset Securities.The corporate value of Millie’s Library is estimated to be around 300 billion won ($239 million), according to market insiders.With funds raised from the IPO, the company plans to invest in the production of original book content as well as other content.The company’s sales revenue surged on-year by 61 percent to 28.9 billion won last year. However, it posted an operating loss of 34.8 billion won, and has still not turned a profit.Millie’s Library has been seeking to accelerate growth momentum after it was acquired by Genie Music, the music streaming platform under KT, in 2021. Genie Music currently holds 39 percent of the shares of the company.Working with the KT artificial intelligence business unit, the e-book platform plans to create synergy with an AI-based audio platform to produce more content, including audiobooks.Last year, Seo Young-taek, CEO of Millie’s Library, said if the company’s intellectual property-based business model is well received, its value will exceed the 500 billion won of Radish, the US webtoon platform acquired by Kakao Entertainment. In the long term, the company looks to achieve more than 1 trillion won in value, Seo added.But concerns loom over the e-book platform’s debut amid a lackluster IPO market and an ongoing slump in platform giants such as Naver and Kakao, industry sources said. Naver’s stock price has traded below 300,000 won since late April, while Kakao is also showing sluggish movement between 80,000 and 90,000 won in the citied period.“The company has grown exponentially to become the country’s largest online library platform in just six years. Based on our vision -- ‘become friends with an unlimited number of books’ -- we will expand the presence in the book content market,” Seo said in a statement. Launched in 2017, Millie’s Library services 110,000 e-books through 1,400 publishers as of May. The company is the first here to provide an e-book subscription service. It produces audiobooks, “chat books,” which are books re-created in a chatting format, and audio dramas.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

									Taiwan’s Fubon Financial becomes third-largest shareholder in Hyundai Card								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220520000488&ACE_SEARCH=1,20-5-2022,2022-10-13,"
Hyundai Card headquarters in Seoul (Hyundai Card)Taiwanese banking giant Fubon Financial on Friday raised its stake in South Korea’s Hyundai Card to nearly 20 percent, expanding its clout over management of the card issuer. Fubon Financial is now the card issuer’s third-largest shareholder with 19.98 percent after Hyundai Motor with 36.96 percent and Hyundai Commercial with 28.56 percent. Kia Corp. is the fourth-largest stakeholder with 11.48 percent. The latest announcement puts a final stamp on the exit of a consortium led by Hong Kong-based private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners from the card issuer, which previously owned a 24 percent threshold. Since last year, Affinity had sold its some 20 percent stake to Fubon Financial’s commercial banking unit Fubon Bank and life insurer Fubon Life Insurance for roughly 520 billion won ($409 million). The remaining 4 percent stake was sold to Hyundai Commercial. The move comes four years after the consortium bought the same number of shares for 380 billion won. It also effectively nullifies the Affinity’s initial request made in 2017 for Hyundai Card to complete its initial public offering within four years of the stake purchase, indefinitely delaying the possible listing. “There are no immediate plans for an IPO,” Hyundai Card said in a statement in the day. Early this year, Hyundai Card’s two outside directors from Affinity left their posts to be replaced by Douglas Tsai, management associate at Fubon Financial Holding. The company is expected to fill the vacant post with another Fubon official. “Fubon Financial has highly regarded Hyundai Card’s potential to further grow as a private label credit card issuer alongside our data science and branding skills as our strategic investor,” the card issuer said in a statement. A private label credit card is a credit card that offers more benefits for use at a specific brand‘s stores. Fubon Financial was founded in 1961 with multiple subsidiaries including Fubon Life, Taipei Fubon Bank, Fubon Securities, Fubon Asset Management and more. As of the end of 2021, Fubon Financial Holdings had unaudited net assets of $10.51 trillion. At the end of 2015, Fubon Life purchased a 48 percent stake in Hyundai Life Insurance, to rebrand it as Fubon Hyundai Life.Hyundai Card’s net profit in the first three months of this year declined 4 percent on-year to 76.9 billion won, according to regulatory filing.By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

Taiton Resources launches $10 million IPO to explore the potential for another Olympic Dam story,https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/994626/taiton-resources-launches-10-million-ipo-to-explore-the-potential-for-another-olympic-dam-story-994626.html,13:02 Thu 06 Oct 2022,2022-10-13 03:04:47.961584,"
Taiton Resources Ltd has launched an initial public offer (IPO) to raise up to $10 million at 20 cents per share to advance its polymetallic and gold projects in Western Australia and South Australia, with a focus on the Highway Project in South Australia.
The Highway Project lies within a prominent geological address that hosts major IOCG (iron oxide copper gold) deposits including Olympic Dam, Carrapateena and Prominent Hill.

Location of Highway Project.
On admission, Taiton’s project portfolio will comprise the following:
Highway Project in South Australia,
Lake Barlee Project in Western Australia; and
Challenger West Project in South Australia.
Taiton managing director Noel Ong spoke with Proactive recently about the IPO and plans for the projects.

Highway Project
The company has set its sight on advancing the Highway Project, situated about 590 kilometres from the state capital of Adelaide.
Taiton’s target evaluation of the Merino Prospect within the project has identified the potential for large-scale molybdenum-enriched polymetallic porphyry overlooked by prior explorers.
Notably, the evaluation of the data shows that Merino is potentially tapping the source rocks that feed the Olympic Dam IOCG Belt.
This is impressive given that the Olympic Dam IOCG Belt hosts the multi-billion-dollar Olympic Dam mine, one of the largest copper deposits in the world.
Zircons indicating Olympic Metallurgical Event
The zircon geochronological work completed by Taiton provides compelling evidence for not only an extension to the OME (Olympic Metallurgical Event) Domain, but also that Merino itself is likely a shallow hydrothermal system (ie, by way of the zircon isotope analyses).
The zircons analysed which was extracted from the porphyritic granite (as shallow as 7m depth), appear indicative of hydrothermal mixing of fluids concentrated in lead, uranium and REEs (rare earth elements).
Importantly, Taiton has identified very shallow basement from the historical drilling data (Figure 1), with most of the holes indicating a depth of less than 20 metres.

Figure 1 - Previous exploration results for the Merino Prospect-Highway Polymetallic Project. The area is suspected to form part of a rift complex containing porphyry systems and coeval with the OME according to recent geochronological dating by the company.
This is important for Taiton in that it is cost-effective for the company to explore for porphyries and IOCG at such shallow depths.
Taiton’s zircon geochemistry analyses indicate a magma related to mineralised porphyry and haematitic IOCG systems with high oxidation state, high-water content, and a high degree of fractionation.
Initial interpretation is for a large hydrothermal system at Merino, with successive overprinting and evidence of vectoring to a core yet to be discovered under shallow cover.
CSIRO hydrochemical survey supports a hydrothermal active zone
Hydrogeochemical water bore analyses undertaken by CSIRO/GSSA in the area of the Merino Prospect are suggestive of the presence of hydrothermal systems at shallow depth (which tends to corroborate the Taiton data).
Interestingly, the Highway Project lies within circle no.5 in Figure 2 below, which shows areas for potential mineralisation identified by CSIRO based on the known mineralisation expressions.

Figure 2: New areas of interest across South Australia based upon the available hydrogeochemical data.
Potential discovery of a new mineral province
Taiton has identified several untested residual gravity anomalies from the SARIG database which are coincident with the new area of interest identified by CSIRO/GSSA's assessment of hydrogeochemical data.

Figure 3 – Porphyry/IOCG system target area.
The area is anomalous for IOCG-type elements, which in conjunction with zircon geochronology work by the company, suggests potential OME-age hydrothermal system.
Taiton is focused on the red areas in Figure 3 which have been considered as “unmineralised” in the past.
It is like when Gold Road Resources was working at the Yarmana Greenstone Belt. 
Everyone assumed that the rocks are too young and there will be no gold mineralisation like what they see in the Norseman-Wiluna Belt (Kalgoorlie Region). 
Now, Gold Road is nearing a 10-million-ounce gold resource.
Exploration strategy
Taiton believes that existing data supports a strategy for the discovery of molybdenum-enriched porphyry at Merino Prospect.
Follow-up exploration will assist in the compilation of an ore paragenesis model of the style and type of mineralisation at Merino.
Taiton’s initial exploration will comprise a multi-disciplinary approach:
induced polarisation (IP) geophysical survey
reconnaissance drilling
geochemical and petrological studies
gravity surveys
IPO details
Taiton is aiming to raise a minimum of $7 million and up to a maximum of $10 million from its IPO which closes on October 21, 2022.
The proceeds from the IPO will be utilised by the company to continue systematically explore its projects.
While Taiton has developed and designed programs to undertake exploration activities on each of the projects, it will also pursue and assess other new business opportunities in the resources sector over time which complement its business.

Porsche shares stuck in first gear on IPO debut ,https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/994122/porsche-shares-stuck-in-first-gear-on-ipo-debut-994122.html,18:44 Fri 30 Sep 2022,2022-10-13 03:04:54.038252,"
After listing in Frankfurt yesterday, shares in Porsche AG (ETR:P911) closed the day at the same price as its initial public offering (IPO) price.
Shares ended at €82.50 after climbing as high as €85.88. They are currently trading at €82.94, with the impressive start coming despite weak global stock markets and sky-high German inflation figures.
Spun out by Volkswagen, Porsche was valued at the top end of its price range, €75bn, becoming Europe’s largest IPO since 1999.
VW raised €19.5bn from the float to aid the company’s electrification transition, while keeping a 25% plus one share stake in Porsche.
Cornerstone investors, including the soverign wealth funds of Qatar, Norway and Adu Dhabi, as well as T. Rowe Price Group (NASDAQ:TROW), laid claim to 40% of the share offering.
VW said of the €19.5bn proceeds just under €10bn will go to the company and 49% to go to shareholders as a special dividend at the end of the year.

"Porsche's IPO is a big one, but will it ignite the market?",https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/993901/porsche-s-ipo-is-a-big-one-but-will-it-ignite-the-market-993901.html,23:36 Wed 28 Sep 2022,2022-10-13 03:04:54.470128,"
In what has been a lacklustre year for companies floating, there many investors might be hoping that Porsche AG (ETR:P911) and Volkswagen (VW) ignite the market on Thursday.
The luxury vehicle manufacturer is set for a valuation of €75bn, Europe’s largest float since 1999.
With 2022 having been the weakest since the financial crisis in terms of cash raised through initial public offerings (IPO) in Europe, at €4.5bn, Porsche will certainly buck the trend.
Why is Volkswagen getting rid?
VW bought Porsche in 2012, ending what at the time had been a saga lasting years.
The two agreed to merge in 2009 but faced a plethora of legal obstacles which resulted in VW buying the remaining 50.1% stake it did not already own.
Porsche’s IPO ends the German car manufacturer’s 10-year stint as its parent company, albeit it will still be the largest shareholder with a 25%-plus-one-share stake in the brand.
A statement issued in February by VW said Porsche’s IPO would be used to “accelerate the industrial and technological transformation of the Volkswagen Group.”
That includes its aim to become a pure electric vehicle manufacturer by 2035.
In that sense, getting rid of Porsche makes sense.
Porsche is and has been seen, as a vehicle for petrolheads and a ‘heritage brand’ for lovers of the brand.
That means pumping money into transitioning it alongside VW into an EV manufacturer, while possible, might not make sense financially. 
Why the interest?
Luxury car makers haven’t exactly had it easy when going public.
A quick glance at what Aston Martin has done since listing nearly four years ago, down 97%, will tell you exactly that.
Add into the mix Porsche hasn’t produced a car as popular as the 911 according to industry experts, which was released nearly 60 years, and it’s tough to see why the book running was as popular as it was.
However, some of the numbers so far this year paint a positive picture.
Revenue was up 8% in the first half with underlying earnings (EBITDA) margins of 24.5%.
Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, also believes that Porsche is a “well run-company” which generated €33.1bn in revenue and €5.3bn in operating profit prior to VW’s takeover in 2011.
There may also be a sense of investors buying the brand rather than the financials, but Aston Martin shareholders know only too well what can happen when hearts rule heads in the luxury car market.
Is it the right time?
At the back end of last year, when VW was reportedly to list Porsche’s shares, it was believed to be looking for a valuation of around €100bn.
Since then, war in Ukraine sparked the current economic downturn which resulted in soaring inflation and geopolitical uncertainty creating a risk-averse market.
Seemingly, there is no end in sight to current economic conditions, so VW may be getting rid while the valuation is still high, given it is already down 25% from what it was originally targeting.
What does it mean for the market?
As mentioned, the market has not exactly been an opportunistic and buying market.
Data from Refinitiv European companies so far this year have raised €44bn, with only €4.5bn from IPOs.
Porsche’s IPO is expected to generate just shy of €20bn, which should provide some positive sentiment.
However, the flotation “is not necessarily transformative in terms of activity levels in the near-term,” said Martin Thorneycorft, head of EMEA cash equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), quoted in Reuters.
Porsche’s IPO will be a bumper one, but is not likely to be one that will start a spree of companies coming to the market as the wider economy continues to weigh on sentiment.

TUYA FINAL DEADLINE TODAY: ROSEN, A TOP RANKED FIRM, Encourages Tuya Inc. Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Tuesday Deadline in Securities Class Action - TUYA

GlobeNewswire

October 11, 2022



NEW YORK, Oct.  11, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Tuya Inc. (NYSE: TUYA) pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement and related prospectus (collectively, the ""Registration Statement"") issued in connection with Tuya's March 2021 initial public offering (the ""IPO"") of the important October 11, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Tuya securities pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Tuya class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=7007 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than October 11, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the IPO Registration Statement featured false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) a material portion of Tuya's China-based customers were engaged in the widespread and systematic manipulation of reviews and product offerings in violation of Amazon.com's terms of use; (2) prior to the IPO, a consumer investigation and data breach had exposed an illicit fake review scheme being perpetrated by many of Tuya's clients, among others, which included, among other things, the exposure of 13 million records of organized fake review scams linked to over 200,000 Amazon account profiles; (3) as a result, there was a substantial risk that a material portion of Tuya's significant customers would be barred from using Amazon.com's platform, negatively impacting Tuya's business, revenue, earnings, and prospects; and (4) as such, the IPO's Registration Statement's representations regarding Tuya's historical financial and operational metrics and purported market opportunities and expected growth did not accurately reflect the actual business, operations, financial results, and trajectory of Tuya at the time of the IPO. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Tuya class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=7007 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

ROSEN, A HIGHLY RECOGNIZED LAW FIRM, Encourages Yatsen Holding Limited Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - YSG

GlobeNewswire

October 11, 2022



NEW YORK, Oct.  11, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Yatsen Holding Limited (NYSE: YSG): (i) pursuant and/or traceable to the the Company's initial public offering conducted on or about November 19, 2020 (the ""IPO""); and/or (ii) between November 19, 2020 and March 10, 2022, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the important November 22, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Yatsen securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Yatsen class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=8895 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 22, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles.

In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, including in the registration statement and prospectus used to effectuate the Company's IPO, Yatsen and the other named defendants misled investors into believing that Perfect Diary and Little Ondine were thriving, thereby driving Yatsen's ""healthy"" top-line growth at the time of its IPO and quarter after quarter thereafter. In truth, however, cosmetic and skincare sales of Perfect Diary and Little Ondine products were declining in the period leading up to (and including at the time of) the IPO and throughout 2021. Moreover, as the truth about Yatsen's business reached the market, the value of the Company's shares declined dramatically, causing Yatsen investors to suffer significant damages. By the commencement of the action, Yatsen's shares traded as low as $0.39 per ADS, representing a decline of over 96% from the $10.50 IPO offering price.

 NEW YORK, Oct.  11, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Yatsen Holding Limited (NYSE: YSG): (i) pursuant and/or traceable to the the Company's initial public offering conducted on or about November 19, 2020 (the ""IPO""); and/or (ii) between November 19, 2020 and March 10, 2022, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the important November 22, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Yatsen securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Yatsen class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=8895 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 22, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, including in the registration statement and prospectus used to effectuate the Company's IPO, Yatsen and the other named defendants misled investors into believing that Perfect Diary and Little Ondine were thriving, thereby driving Yatsen's ""healthy"" top-line growth at the time of its IPO and quarter after quarter thereafter. In truth, however, cosmetic and skincare sales of Perfect Diary and Little Ondine products were declining in the period leading up to (and including at the time of) the IPO and throughout 2021. Moreover, as the truth about Yatsen's business reached the market, the value of the Company's shares declined dramatically, causing Yatsen investors to suffer significant damages. By the commencement of the action, Yatsen's shares traded as low as $0.39 per ADS, representing a decline of over 96% from the $10.50 IPO offering price. To join the Yatsen class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=8895 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

"Luxury Alternative Investment Platform, LUXUS, Announces the IPO of the $1.5M Golden Dahlia Ring",https://futures.tradingcharts.com/news/futures/Luxury_Alternative_Investment_Platform__LUXUS__Announces_the_IPO_of_the__1_5M_Golden_Dahlia_Ring_416387806.html," NEW YORK, October 11, 2022 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
 ",2022-10-13," NEW YORK, October 11, 2022 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
 LUXUS, the world's first luxury alternative investment platform specializing in precious gems and high jewelry, announces its second IPO, the Golden Dahlia, a rare Fancy Vivid Yellow diamond ring with a market capitalization of $1.5M, selling at $300 per share.
 This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221010005555/en/
 Previously available only to the ultra-wealthy, celebrities, royalty and institutional collectors, LUXUS has made this exclusivity accessible to investors of all levels on its digital platform. With LUXUS' second IPO, investors now have the opportunity to partake in fractional ownership of these rare assets.
 The Fancy Vivid Yellow grade represents the pinnacle of the yellow diamond category, and the Golden Dahlia's antique emerald cut with no inclusions is a true rarity that is highly sought after by collectors, consumers and connoisseurs. LUXUS is making it available for investors for the first time ever.
 Additionally, the high inflationary market environment and geopolitical instability make ultra rare assets like the Golden Dahlia challenging to procure. As investors seek the safe havens of hard assets, demand for scarce precious metals & gems is stronger than ever. ""As LUXUS grows, we are committed to providing investors with access to the world's scarcest assets so that they can effectively hedge their exposure to traditional asset classes. We look forward to releasing research and educational materials in the coming months as the capabilities of our technology platform deepen and our team grows,"" said Founder and CEO, Dana Auslander. ""The Golden Dahlia is one of many exceptional fancy colored diamonds that we intend to offer investors as they explore this emerging asset class.""
 All assets listed on the platform are independently appraised and valued through IGI (International Gemological Institute), the global leader in diamond jewelry grading. Each asset is accompanied by a GIA grading report to ensure authenticity. Further, fancy colored diamonds contain a rarity report from FCRF (Fancy Colored Research Foundation).
 About LUXUS

LUXUS partners with the world's premium brands to unlock fractional ownership in coveted jewelry, ethically sourced precious gems, rare timepieces, accessories and more for retail investors around the world.

Specifically, the IPO documents and defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) TuSimple's commitment to safety was significantly overstated and defendants concealed fundamental problems with the Company's technology; (2) TuSimple was rushing the testing of its autonomous driving technology in order to deliver driverless trucks to the market ahead of its more safety-conscious competitors; (3) there was a corporate culture within TuSimple that suppressed or ignored safety concerns in favor of unrealistically ambitious testing and delivery schedules; (4) the aforementioned conduct made accidents involving TuSimple's autonomous driving technology more likely; (5) the aforementioned conduct invited enhanced regulatory scrutiny and investigatory action toward TuSimple; and (6) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Yarra Private Capital Discovery Fund will seek to raise $100 million or more. “We’ve observed this part of the market for some time. And what attracted us is, we felt that was hugely inefficient,” said Dion Hershan, Yarra’s executive chairman and head of Australian equities.

The IPO will comprise fresh issuance of equity shares worth Rs 370 crore and an offer-for-sale of equity stocks aggregating to Rs 370 crore by promoter Inox Wind, according to the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP). Besides, the company may consider a pre-IPO placement. If such a placement is completed, the fresh issue size will be reduced. Inox Green Energy Services, which had filed draft IPO papers with Sebi on June 20, obtained the observation letter from the regulator on September 13, an update with the capital markets watchdog showed on Monday. The issuance of an observation letter by Sebi implies its go ahead to float the initial share sale. Going by the draft papers, proceeds from the fresh issue will be used for payment of debt and general corporate purposes. Inox Green Energy Services is engaged in the business of providing long-term Operation and Maintenance (O&M) services for wind farm projects, specifically for Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) and common infrastructure facilities on wind farms, which support the evacuation of power from such WTGs. Earlier, the company had filed the DRHP for its proposed IPO in February with the Sebi. However, the draft offer documents for the IPO were withdrawn in late April without disclosing any reason. "

Then suddenly, at the time of the IPO, these companies priced their shares at a substantial premium to the pre-offer price. Any company planning such a move should now watch out. Sebi is set to ask such companies and their merchant bankers to explain what happened in the intervening months to justify the substantial price differential.Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on Tuesday said companies were free to price their IPOs. But if there is a substantial difference between the prices before and at the time of the IPO, merchant bankers will have to explain the same. In the last one year, such trends were observed in several new age tech companies that went public, and now the prices of those stocks are at a discount to the IPO price.According to the Sebi chief, such disclosures would be beneficial to both the parties. In case there’s a problem in the company, following which investors allege that they were misled into investing in its shares, then there could be a problem in the transaction. “Full disclosure protects both the discloser and the disclosed. Both parties are protected. And this is the spirit in which we believe in, 100% transparency and disclosure,” Buch said. She was speaking at Ficci’s annual capital market conference in the city.The Sebi chairperson also said that from now on, all changes to the regulations would be based on data and urged stakeholders to also depend on data when they approach the regulator with their proposals, suggestions and comments. That way it would be easier for Sebi to take decisions and support the industry, she said. This would also facilitate an environment of partnership that would help create more wealth for investors and for the country. She also urged stakeholders to be specific and give actionable recommendations for the regulator to consider, rather than sending in suggestions that are generic in nature."
Sebi has no business to suggest IPO pricing of new-age tech firms: Madhabi Puri Buch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-has-no-business-to-suggest-ipo-pricing-of-new-age-tech-firms-madhabi-puri-buch/articleshow/94176894.cms,"Sep 13, 2022, 16:31 IST",2022-10-13 03:07:02.539644,"MUMBAI: Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on Tuesday said the capital markets regulator has no business to suggest pricing of the initial share sale of new-age technology companies.  She, however, quickly added that there needs to be more disclosures by companies on how valuations have changed between a pre-initial public offering (IPO) placement and the price which is being asked for in the issue.  ""A lot has been said about the pricing of IPOs of tech companies... at what price you choose to do the IPO is your business, we have no business to suggest otherwise,"" Buch said addressing the annual Capital Markets summit organised by industry lobby Ficci here.  Buch, the career-banker-turned-regulator and the first woman chair of Sebi, explained through an example of a company selling shares to investors at Rs 100 and then asking for Rs 450 in an IPO within a few months.  She said a company is free to ask for a higher price, but needs to disclose what happened in the intervening period which justifies the massive change in the valuation.  It can be noted that there have been concerns about investors, especially the unsuspecting retail ones, being taken for a ride due to high valuations sought by new-age tech companies. The share price of payment platform Paytm collapsed to a third of the IPO issue price within a few weeks of listing.  When asked about some recent incidents and what can be done to avoid such experiences, Buch parried the question saying investment bankers ought to answer that.  Meanwhile, she also said Sebi is analysing data and information on retail participation in the futures and options segment, which may lead to more disclosures to be made available to them.  ""Sebi will continue to be consultative and democratic in its approach while making regulations and be driven only by data,"" she said.  As part of a reorganisation exercise, Sebi has appointed one to three officials in every department whose key resource area is to come out with ideas on regulation which will make the industry ""celebrate"", she said.  The regulator has also sought changes in the Sebi Act which will help it test potential ideas in a regulatory sandbox, she said. "

Sebi chairman Madhabi Puri Buch had said that some of the recently listed tech-driven companies had offered their shares in the IPO at prices which were much higher than the prices at which they had placed their shares to a handful of investors.After the Sebi decision, companies that want to go public will have to disclose the reasons behind any price difference between IPO price and the pre-IPO prices. If a company is offering shares in the IPO at Rs 450 and the same shares were sold to a handful of investors just a few months ago at Rs 150, Sebi would like to know what had changed in the company between these months that could justify this hike in IPO price.Sebi board “approved the proposal to mandate the issuers coming out with IPO, to make disclosure of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and price per share of issuer based on past transactions and past fundraising done by the issuer from the investors under ‘Basis for Issue Price’ section of the offer document, and in price band advertisement,” a release said.The companies should disclose price per share of the issuer company based on primary/new issue of shares and based on secondary sale/acquisition of shares, during the 18 months period prior to IPO, the release said. In case there are no such transactions in the previous 18 months, then the price at which the last five primary or secondary transactions, not older than three years prior to IPO, should be disclosed.Sebi board also approved pre-filing of offer documents by an IPO-bound company without giving out confidential information about it. Under the pre-filing process it could also get Sebi’s initial observations and then it could decide to file the draft document for IPO."

The initial offer document will only need to be filed with Sebi and the stock exchanges, and the company can decide whether to go public or not after the regulator issues its observations, Sebi said in its proposal. Currently in India, companies first file a draft prospectus with SEBI that contains regulatory disclosures, which is also released publicly for comments for at least 21 days. Later, after incorporating any regulatory and other feedback, a final prospectus is filed for approval again. Sebi said one of the concerns for companies is the disclosure of such sensitive information in their draft offer documents, ""which may be beneficial to its competitors, without the certainty that the initial public issuance would be executed."" Globally, countries including the United States and Canada allow a confidential ""pre-filing"" with regulators before a company decides to proceed with an IPO, Sebi said. Sebi is seeking comments from the public on its new proposal by June 6. Such proposals are commonly floated by the market regulator, and there is no certainty that it would be enforced as a policy. "

To start with, the founders Ambareesh Murty and Ashish Shah have redomiciled Pepperfry from Cayman Islands to Mumbai. They had registered Pepperfry in Cayman Islands as the earlier plan was to establish a primary listing in the US. Subsequently, they changed their strategy as, according to Indian capital market regulations, a foreign-registered company cannot do an initial public offering (IPO) here. The partners are also shaping the company’s board composition, roping in independent directors, to meet local capital market laws. Rules require the board to be made up of 33% independent directors, if its chairman is an independent director. Pepperfry seeks to raise as much as $300 million via sale of new stock as well as a secondary offering of shares. While the founders are not keen on offloading their shares in the IPO, external investors such as Norwest Ventures, Broad Street Investments, Bertelsmann and General Electric Pension Trust, which hold large stakes in Pepperfry, are likely to encash a portion of their investments. However, there’s a cap on the quantum of stake they can sell through the IPO. Rules state that a share sale by investors who own more than 20% in a company should not exceed over 50% of their pre-issue holding, while that of shareholders holding less than 20% should not go beyond 10% of their pre-issue holding. Pepperfry plans to file a draft IPO prospectus with regulator Sebi this year. It has so far raised $285 million through equity and debt to finance its growth ambitions. “Pepperfry is well-capitalised and on the path to achieving profitability,” said co-founder Shah. It had last raised a debt of $40 million in November 2021 and had managed to narrow its operational losses by 60% to Rs 37 crore in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2020, operational losses stood at Rs 95 crore. Murty and Shah, who met while working for eBay, established Pepperfry in 2011 as a fashion and lifestyle products player before foraying into furniture retailing. Today, Pepperfry, with a presence of nearly 200 stores in the country, is the largest furniture retailer. It despatched 9.8 lakh shipments during the 12 months ending June 2022. "

Why Zomato shares tanked 14% today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/markets/why-zomato-shares-tanked-14-today/articleshow/93105127.cms,"  Jul 25, 2022, 12:43 IST",2022-10-13 03:07:03.676899,"NEW DELHI: Food chain platform Zomato's shares fell to a record low on Monday as the lock-in period for pre-IPO shareholders ended on July 23 ( Saturday). The stock was down 14 per cent in early trade at Rs 46. There is a mandatory lock-in period of one year for promoters, employees and other shareholders, who bought the stock before the IPO ended on July 23, 2021. As per market regulator Sebi's rule, the company which does not have promoters, the equity share capital held by the company before IPO is locked for a period of one year from the date of allotment of shares. During this period, these shareholders are barred from selling any equity. Point to note: Over 613 crore shares of Zomato were under lock-in from the date of allotment, that is July 23, 2021. These shares constitute roughly about 78 per cent of the shareholding of the company, which means shares of this food service platform will remain under the sell-off pressure. Info Edge, Antfin, Alipay, Temasek, Uber are amongst the early investors in Zomato. Pre-IPO anchor investors who subscribed to 44% of the total IPO size included Tiger Global, Fidelity, Blackrock, JPMorgan. At the time, anchor investors paid the price of Rs 76/share for Zomato. Shares of Zomato were listed on BSE and NSE on July 23, 2021, at a premium of more than 51 per cent. After its listing, Zomato shares hit a lifetime high of Rs 169 in November 2021, breaching Rs 1 trillion market valuations during its post-listing rally. However, since then, the stock has been tanking. After a surge following the debut about one year ago, Zomato shares pared those gains to now trade about 40% below the IPO price. That compares to a 4.9% increase for the Nifty 50 Index over the same period.  Analysts are questioning the company’s profitability and viability. ""The stock of Zomato completes one year of listing. With this, the lock in period for insiders and institutions has come to an end triggering the current sell off. For a loss making company with no visibility on profits over the next few years, it is difficult to arrive at an intrinsic value. At best, it's a guessing game we would like to avoid. If anything, the business is getting more speculative with increasing stakes in quick delivery models which have not succeeded in most parts of the world. Right since its IPO, for these reasons we have avoided stocks like Zomato and maintain the same view,"" said Richa Agarwal, Senior Research Analyst, Equitymaster. Zomato’s successful IPO last year set the tone for the coming-out parties of a generation of unicorns, including digital-payments firm One 97 Communications Ltd. But their shares have also plummeted as doubts persist about the valuations of loss-making technology firms, particularly as global macroeconomic uncertainty mounts. The company is competing against deeper-pocketed rivals including Amazon.com Inc. and Naspers Ltd.-backed Swiggy, presenting hurdles in how quickly it can become profitable. Its recent acquisition of fellow startup Blinkit in quick-commerce, another high-competition, high-cash-burn segment, has left investors unimpressed. ""Zomato Ltd. has witnessed a significant underperformance since its listing and has fallen a whopping 71 per cent from its all-time high price. The company has been shunned by the investors post the beginning of the rate hike cycle by the central banks globally and the huge sell-off in the tech sector. Further, the company will take significant time to show profitability and the current market sentiments are punishing startups that are growing without showing profits. Therefore, we are averse to Zomato Ltd. despite its strong position in the online Food Service platforms and the current correction,"" said Punit Patni, Equity Research Analyst, Swastika Investmart Ltd. ""Last years, global market liquidity, sky rocketing valuations of global tech firms and high investor interest in new age companies ensured many high net individuals, private equity players and other istitutions entering Zomato at Pre IPO stage. The company had also created a huge wealth for the investors with valuations rising from $3bn in 2020 to over $12 bn post listing. With a significant correction in the markets and particularly in these new age tech company valuations globally, fall in global liquidity and appetite from institutions in non-profitable start-ups and with uncertainties regarding organic growth and profitability, these pre-IPO investors are looking for an exit,"" said Divam Sharma, Founder at Green Portfolio, SEBI Registered Portfolio Management Service Provider. Such type of dumping is seen frequently as the lock in for pre-IPO investors end. ""New investors should let the price settle in, there will still be lots of opportunities to invest in Zomato. Also, one should look for signs of profitability, consistent organic growth and acquisitions showing signs of synergy to enter the stock as an investment,"" added Sharma. Zomato listed a year ago with an issue price of Rs 76/share and is trading around Rs 50-share levels. “The stock is expected to remain bears' favourite sell on rise for short to medium term as the stock was offered at Rs 76 per equity share in the primary markets around a year ago,"" added Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities. The delivery giant reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the March quarter. Some analysts anticipate Zomato will narrow its red ink over time, and point out that the meal-delivery market remains in its infancy. Zomato is the latest Asian technology company to see shares under pressure following the end of IPO lock-up periods. Chinese artificial-intelligence-software maker SenseTime Group Inc.’s collapsed in Hong Kong last month once restrictions on sales by cornerstones ended. With inputs from Bloomberg"
"Of the 10 worst-performing IPOs of 2021, 5 are new-age tech startups",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/markets/of-the-10-worst-performing-ipos-of-2021-5-are-new-age-tech-startups/articleshow/93265556.cms,"  Aug 1, 2022, 11:04 IST",2022-10-13 03:07:03.891479,"NEW DELHI: Some of the biggest stock listings of 2021 have lost their edge and eroded in value as worries over US Fed tightening and concerns over cash flows are weighing on investor sentiment. The worsening global outlook has led several investors to book profits in high-profile consumer and tech stocks that debuted with inflated valuations in the last fiscal. Data compiled by Prime Database shows that compared to their offer price, the worst performing IPOs of fiscal 2022 are Suryoday Small Finance Bank ( down 72.5% from its offer price), Paytm ( down 66.8% compared to its offer price), Carwale ( down 58%), Fino Payments Bank ( down 54.8 percent), Policybazaar ( down 53.4 percent), Windlas Biotech ( down 52.8%) AGS Trans Technologies ( down 52.08%) and Zomato ( down 42.10 percent).   Of these, five were major tech IPO launches of 2021 — Zomato, Paytm, Nykaa, Fino Payments Bank, Policy Bazaar and CarTrade. Investors have turned cautious as the ongoing events globally has changed their appetite for new age growth stocks to traditional defensive stocks. Paytm, which was the poster boy for India’s tech startups, has lost over two-third of its value since its IPO and become a symbol of the industry’s crash. From an offer price of Rs 2150 in November 2021, the stock is down 66.8% as of 27 July 2022 to trade at Rs 713.65. On its debut itself, the stock was down 27%. Skeptics say profitability will remain an uphill battle. Analysts at Macquarie Capital Securities (India) Pvt., who were early to predict Paytm’s stock decline, said in March that the shares would plummet further to Rs 450. The stock is down 46% year to date. Paytm’s stock-price collapse exacerbated a crisis for India’s startups, sending valuations plummeting as investors began to grow cautious about their earnings potential. Young firms -- dozens of which had hit unicorn status as capital flowed to everything from online retail to digital learning in the country of 1.4 billion -- suddenly saw their fundraising plans grind to a halt. To make matters worse, the war in Ukraine and fears of a global recession further clouded the picture for startups worldwide. Zomato: Shares of Indian food delivery company Zomato fell more than 14% to a record low last week, as the one-year share lock-in period for promoters, employees and other pre-IPO investors expired following the 2021 listing. Zomato has had the most significant share price decline of the six companies, as investors lost roughly 66% of the total value of their investments a year ago. The stock is down 67% year to date. The stock is down 42% since its debut in July 2021. As of 27, July, 2022, the stock was trading at Rs 43.95 from its offer price of Rs 76. Zomato is scheduled to report its first-quarter results today. The company had reported a 75% jump in fourth-quarter (Q4FY22) revenue, while gross order value (GOV), the total value of all food delivery orders on its online platform, surged 77% from the year-ago quarter. “From the exuberance seen at the time of listing last year, Zomato is now unloved, having underperformed peers on a year-to-date basis. Blinkit acquisition elongates path to profitability and despite management guidance on a break-even in food delivery, investors are not giving it much benefit of doubt. We think this makes for a great case for long-term investors to ‘buy’ the stock,“ Jefferies said in a note recently. CarTrade: The Initial Public Offer (IPO) of this tech company was launched in in August 2021 at a price band of Rs 1585 to Rs 1618 per equity share. The issue opened at a discounted price and has been under sell-off heat since listing. CarTrade share price today is ₹690 per share, which is around 57 per cent lower from its issue price. The stock is down over 58% from its issue price of Rs 1618. Fino Payments Bank: The fintech, which essentially provides businesses with technical banking solutions, is down 54.8% as of 27 July, 2022 from its offer price of Rs 577 on 29 November 2021. The stock is currently trading at Rs 260.55 PolicyBazaar: The stock of Gurugram-based PB Fintech — the parent of insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar — has lost over 50% since its debut on 1 November 2021. The stock is down 53.1% at Rs 457.60 from its offer price of Rs 980. Nykaa: Shares of FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd, the parent company of Nykaa, have fallen nearly 37% since its listing in November 2021, Though, Nykaa shares are up over 27% gains from its IPO issue price of Rs1,125 apiece, the beauty retail company founded by entrepreneur Falguni Nayyar, is down 45% from its record high price. Last year India was flooded with ample liquidity thanks to low interest rates globally, which drove up prices of these new-tech companies. Now there is a liquidity crunch crunch and a continuous rise in interest rates , and so the shares of these companies have taken the biggest hit. In fact 2021 was an abnormal year that witnessed Indian startups raise about $42 billion in funding and the emergene of about 46 unicorns in one year as global investors lined up to throw money into India. But 2022 has witnessed a surge of startup issues as funding as dried up-mass layoffs, investor exits, piling losses seems to be the theme this year. ""The Indian startup ecosystem is likely to witness a shift in the pace and quality of venture capital deals in the near future. This is also an opportunity to the start-ups that are burning cash to streamline their operations and adopt a more focussed-approach to ensure profitabilit...Investors are a little wary due to the current environment and have become more decisive about the startups they want to nurture and are focusing extensively from a long-term gain perspective,"" said Mohamad Faraz, Founding Partner, Upsparks, a Micro VC firm who has seed-funded over 50 companies in the last 2 years.

The OFS segment includes shares of up to Rs 135 crore by Adiseshann and up to Rs 3.3 crore by Subramanian. Other early investors will also be selling. Additionally, the company, in consultation with the lead bankers to the issue, may consider a private placement of equity shares aggregating up to Rs 225 crore. If such a placement is completed, the fresh issue size will be reduced. Of the proceeds from its fresh issuance, Rs 77 crore will be utilised for investment for expanding the business into new geographies and Rs 228 crore for pursuing inorganic initiatives. Of the remaining, Rs 689 crore is for placing cash as collateral with its financial institution partners to improve margins and for general corporate purposes. PayMate started as a consumer-facing company in 2006 but evolved into a B2B payments platform. Its customer base includes companies in IT distribution, FMCG, paints, financial services, cement, auto auxiliary, travel & airline, media, manufacturing, and logistics. The brand launched its platform in the UAE in 2018 through PayMate LLC, a subsidiary, as a Visa-certified business payment solution provider. It is also aiming to expand into other parts of central Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA) regions as well. "
Govt to review LIC IPO timeline due to volatility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-to-review-lic-ipo-timeline-due-to-volatility/articleshow/89932192.cms,"Mar 2, 2022, 08:22 IST",2022-10-13 03:07:05.316305,"MUMBAI: The government will review the timeline for LIC’s initial public offering (IPO) in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent volatility in financial markets across the world. “If global considerations warrant that I need to look at it, I wouldn’t mind looking at it again,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, told a business newspaper in an interview, responding to a query on the timing of the LIC listing. She said that the need for the review arose in the wake of the “full-scale war”. Until now all indications were that the insurance giant’s IPO would proceed on schedule. LIC and the department of investment and public asset management (Dipam) continued to hold roadshows even after the Russian invasion last week. On Saturday, the Cabinet approved the proposal to allow 20% foreign direct investment (FDI) in LIC — which was a pre-requisite for the IPO considering that a large chunk of the money is set to come from foreign investors. It was widely expected that the IPO would open between March 7 and 10 as the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) was filed with the markets regulator on February 13. Adding to the speculation was a currency swap announced by the RBI, which would be conducted on March 8. The currency swap was designed to absorb surplus liquidity in the banking system, which was likely on account of the IPO. Although the government had not disclosed the intended mop-up, given the valuation, the IPO size was estimated to be Rs 65,000-75,000 crore — more than 3.5 times Paytm’s Rs 18,300-crore IPO, which is hitherto the largest. According to investment bankers, an IPO is typically launched when there is an upswing in the market. While the Indian equity markets were not in a bear phase there was risk aversion among international investors, which had resulted in a net outflow from foreign portfolio investors. While the government was targeting long-term investors, including sovereign funds to anchor the issue, a correction in the markets would hurt sentiment among retail investors. According to the DRHP, 31.6 crore shares would be offered, representing 5% of the equity stake. The offer document also disclosed the embedded value of LIC at Rs 5.4 lakh crore. Even if a conservative 2.5x multiple were applied to the EV, the corporation would be valued at around Rs 13.5 lakh crore, which would result in a 5% mop-up through the IPO. "
Paytm seeks to raise $268 million in pre-IPO share sale: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/paytm-seeks-to-raise-268-million-in-pre-ipo-share-sale-report/articleshow/84347717.cms,"  Jul 12, 2021, 19:38 IST",2022-10-13 03:07:05.452250,"NEW DELHI: Digital payments firm Paytm is planning to raise $268 million in a funding round as it prepares for an initial public offering (IPO) later this year, a source directly aware of the matter said on Monday. Paytm will also seek to issue Rs 8,300 crore worth of new shares and its backers Alibaba and SoftBank will have the option to sell another Rs 8,300 crore in stock, said the source, who declined to be named as the discussions are not public. Paytm's parent, One97 Communications Ltd, will file a draft prospectus shortly after its extraordinary general meeting on Monday for a domestic IPO that seeks to raise $2.3 billion, sources previously told Reuters. That would make Paytm's IPO India's third-biggest in dollar terms after state-run miner Coal India in 2010 and Reliance Power in 2008. The company won shareholders' approval at the EGM to raise capital and to sell up to Rs 12,000 crore in new stock, the source added. Paytm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Paytm has hired JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley , ICICI Securities, Goldman Sachs, Axis Capital, Citi and HDFC Bank for the IPO, Reuters previously reported. The pre-IPO funding round was first reported by Bloomberg. "
Sebi moots new disclosure framework for IPOs of loss-making companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-moots-new-disclosure-framework-for-ipos-of-loss-making-companies/articleshow/89671232.cms,"  Feb 18, 2022, 22:17 IST",2022-10-13 03:07:05.878760,"NEW DELHI: Markets watchdog Sebi on Friday proposed that loss-making new age technology companies planning to list their shares should make disclosures about their key performance indicators considered for arriving at the basis of issue price in offer documents. Besides, such companies should make disclosures about their valuations based on issuance of new shares and acquisition of shares in the past 18 months before filing draft offer documents, according to a consultation paper. The move comes against the backdrop of many new age companies, that do not have a track record of having an operating profit at least in the preceding three years, tapping the Initial Public Offering (IPO) route to raise funds. Such firms generally remain loss-making for a longer period before achieving break-even as they opt for ways to gain scale of operations rather than profits in the initial years. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has sought comments from the public on the consultation paper till March 5. At present, the 'Basis of Issue Price' section in an offer document covers disclosures of traditional parameters such as key accounting ratios. These include Earnings Per Share (EPS), price to earnings, return on net worth and net asset value of the company as well as comparison of such accounting ratios with its peers. According to Sebi, these parameters are typically descriptive of companies which are profit making and do not relate to a loss-making firm. These parameters may not aid investors in taking investment decisions with respect to an loss-making issuer. ""It is obvious that disclosures in 'Basis of Issue Price' section, particularly for a loss making company, are required to be supplemented with non-traditional parameters like key performance indicators and disclosure of certain additional parameters such as valuation based on past transactions/ fund raising by issuer company,"" Sebi said in the consultation paper. Apart from disclosing the financial ratios as per the current requirements, Sebi has proposed that the issuer company should also make the disclosures about the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that have been considered/have a bearing for arriving at the 'Basis of Issue Price'. An issuer company should disclose about relevant KPIs during the three years prior to the IPO and an explanation of how these KPIs contribute to form the 'Basis of Issue Price'. Also, an issuer company should disclose all material KPIs that have been shared with any pre-IPO investor at any point of time during the three years prior to the IPO. However, for those KPIs which the issuer company deems are not relevant for the proposed IPO, the issuer should provide adequate explanation with proper cross reference to a table disclosing the said KPIs. KPIs stated by an issuer company should be described and defined clearly, consistently and precisely and should not be misleading. Besides, all KPIs should be certified or audited by statutory auditors. In addition, Sebi has suggested that comparison of KPIs with Indian listed peer companies and/or global listed peer companies (wherever available) should be disclosed in the offer document and comparison of KPIs over time should be explained. Apart from KPIs, an issuer firm has been proposed to make disclosure of valuation of issuer company based on secondary and primary sale, in the 18 months prior to the date of filing of the DRHP/RHP. This is subject to conditions where either acquisition or sale is equal to or more than 5 per cent of the fully diluted paid-up share capital of the issue firm in a single transaction or a group of transactions in a short period of time. With reference to valuation of an issuer company based on secondary sale or acquisition of shares and primary or new issue of shares, Sebi has suggested disclosure of floor price and cap price being times the Weighted Average Cost of Acquisition (WACA) based on primary/ secondary transaction(s) should be disclosed in a tabular form. Sebi also said that an issuer firm should offer a detailed explanation for offer price along with comparison of the issuer 's KPIs and financials ratios such as EPS, return on net worth and net asset value for the last two full financial years and the interim period, if any, included in the offer document. This will enable the investors to have a comparative view of the KPIs and other financial ratios for the same period, the regulator said in the consultation paper. "

The IPO is in the nature of a fresh issue and the offer will remain open from March 29 to March 31. The price band of the offer has been fixed at Rs 130- Rs 137 per equity share of face value of Rs 10 each. Bids can be made for a minimum of 100 Equity Shares and in multiples of 100 Equity shares thereafter. The company intends to use the offer proceeds for repayment or pre-payment, in part or full, of certain borrowings (Rs 60 crore), for the payment of acquisition consideration of Edureka or repayment of a bridge loan availed specifically for the purpose (around Rs 25 crore), and for growth initiatives (Rs 50 crore). The company already raised Rs. 40 crore in a private placement in December 2021 at the price of Rs 130 per share. As per the company's red herring prospectus, 75% of the issue will be reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 15% for non-institutional bidders and the rest for retail investors. Up to 60% of the QIB Portion is planned to be allocated to anchor investors of which one-third shall be reserved for domestic Mutual Funds. Kalpathi S Aghoram, Kalpathi S. Ganesh and Kalpathi S.

Commenting on the firm's edtech model, he said Veranda has been focused on a hybrid model right from the start to offer customers the choice of content across all channels. “There are plans to set up more hybrid centres for our software learning arm post going public as part of business plans,” he added. Veranda Learning is in the business of offering integrated learning solutions in online, offline hybrid and offline blended formats to students, aspirants, and graduates, and professionals. They provide courses and learning support through their four subsidiaries — Veranda Race (government exams), Veranda CA, Veranda IAS, and Edureka (for software skilling). For the half year ended September 2021, Veranda made losses of around Rs. 18 crore on revenues of Rs. 15 crore. "
"Draft LIC IPO prospectus to be filed by next week, issue in March: Dipam secretary",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/draft-lic-ipo-prospectus-to-be-filed-by-next-week-issue-in-march-dipam-secretary/articleshow/89301194.cms,"  Feb 2, 2022, 18:21 IST",2022-10-13 03:07:06.421556,"NEW DELHI: The government is likely to file draft papers for the mega initial public offering of LIC with market regulator Sebi by next week, while a portion of the issue would be reserved for anchor investors, a top official said on Wednesday. In an interview with PTI, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary to the department of investment and public asset management (Dipam), said approval of the insurance regulator is awaited, post which the draft prospectus, detailing the size of the share sale, will be filed. The issue, after approval of Sebi, is likely to hit the market in March, he said. LIC's listing is crucial for the government to meet the lowered revenue estimates of Rs 78,000 crore for the current fiscal. The government has so far raised about Rs 12,000 crore from privatisation of Air India and stake sale in other PSUs. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her 2022-23 Budget speech had said: ""The public issue of the LIC is expected shortly."" Pandey said the embedded value of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) has been arrived at and it has to now get clearance from insurance regulator IRDAI. ""Within 7-10 days, the DRHP (Draft Red Herring Prospectus) for LIC IPO will be filed. Informally, we have been consulting Sebi on various issues. The size of the issue would be mentioned in the DRHP,"" he said. The government aims to come out with the initial public offer (IPO) and subsequently list LIC on the bourses by March, he said. ""A portion of the IPO would be reserved for anchor investors like we have done in case of IPOs of IRFC and RailTel,"" Pandey added. Up to 10 per cent of the LIC IPO issue size would be reserved for policyholders. Actuarial firm Milliman Advisors LLP India has worked out the embedded value of LIC, while Deloitte and SBI Caps have been appointed as pre-IPO transaction advisors. Under the embedded value method, insurance companies' present value of future profit is also included in their present net asset value (NAV). The government has appointed 10 merchant bankers, including Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt Ltd, Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt Ltd and Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt Ltd, to manage the mega IPO of the country's largest insurer. The government is also mulling allowing foreign investors to pick up stake in LIC. As per Sebi rules, foreign portfolio investors (FPI) are permitted to buy shares in a public offer. FDI policy would have to be tweaked for FII/FPI investment in this IPO, as LIC is a corporation and not an insurance company. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had in July last year cleared the proposal for LIC's IPO. "

Director of Celios Bhima Yudhistira assesses that the IPO plan for digital companies in the midst of the global economy leading to a recession is actually an interesting thing. This is due to two things, first, the flow of foreign capital in the stock market is still recorded a net buy of IDR 72.8 trillion in all markets. This means that investors still view that the stock market in Indonesia is quite resilient in the face of external shocks due to the large number of consumers and they are in their productive age. ""Our demographics are quite good as a market base,"" said Bhima when contacted by Bisnis, on Monday (10/10/2022). Second, investors are still interested in funding several start-up companies that are listed on the stock exchange with records of above-average financial performance. Bhima also assessed that previously public investors were more likely to pursue digital companies with jumbo valuations, while currently public investors are more realistic. ""So it will depend on how the financial statements are presented and whether innovation in the long term is enough to influence investors' interest. Back to the performance of each prospective issuer,"" explained Bhima Meanwhile, recently Blibli, an e-commerce startup belonging to the Djarum Group, is rumored to be on the Stock Exchange. by OJK (Financial Services Authority). When asked about this, Blibli was still reluctant to give a response. Apart from Blibli, Traveloka, which has just received the latest funding from a government investment institution formed by President Joko Widodo, Sovereign Wealth Fund The Indonesia Investment Authority (SWF INA), BlockRock and Allianz Global worth US$300 million or around Rp.4.57 trillion, is also frequently reported to be IPO. Just like Blibli, Traveloka was reluctant to give a response. Not too long ago, analysts hoped that with the IPO by Blibli, IDX Techno could possibly rebound. The technology sector index or IDX Techno became the index that fell the most during September 2022, which was 11 percent. However, analysts view the technology sector index can still experience strengthening at the end of this year. Senior Investment Information Mirae Asset Sekuritas Martha Christina said the decline in the technology sector index has been very large in 2022. Despite the decline, Martha sees the technology sector as having an opportunity to help with window dressing at the end of 2022. ""In terms of opportunities, IDX Techno can help with window dressing. In addition, there is a Blibli IPO plan which as a whole can lift sentiment for IDX Techno,"" said Martha, in Jakarta, quoted Thursday (6/10/2022).

                            </span>",2022-10-13,"Bisnis.com, JAKARTA - A number of record label companies are currently adapting to the times. The reason is, the entertainment industry is one of the industries that moves fast and tends to be difficult to predict, especially with digitalization which makes content easier to create and reproduce. Meanwhile, one of Indonesia's leading record labels that is always at the forefront of diversifying its business is Trinity Optima Productions. Thanks to his meticulous attention to opportunities to deal with changing trends and market dynamics, it is not surprising that TOP has produced many great artists. At least, there are already more than eight business pillars belonging to Trinity, ranging from record labels, artist management, copyright and content licenses, venture capital to the latest related to managing brand extensions. Founded in 2003, Adi Nugroho, Effendy Widjaja, Handi Santoso and Yonathan Nugroho are the figures behind Trinity Optima Production. “Trinity used to be a marketing agent. The business model is valid until 2003-2005. However, since 2005, along with the development of the music and entertainment industry, Trinity has also innovated and expanded its business into various lines, or the term 360 degree business model,"" said Yonathan Nugroho, CEO and Co-founder of Trinity Optima Production on Wednesday (05/10/2022). . For your information, in the music industry, the 360-degree business model is a business relationship between the artist and the music industry company. Where, the company agrees to provide financial and other support for the artist, including direct advancement and support in marketing, promotion, touring, and other business coverage. ""Although there are pros and cons about the business lines that we build. But, At TOP, we always manage talented musicians to be more creative. Thus, artists are not only able to master the stage and audience when singing, but also have other skills. So that in the future, the lifetime value is still strong. It's a symbiotic mutualism going on there,"" he said. Trinity, which houses many artists such as Maudy Ayunda, Raisa, and Naura Ayu, is also intensively building the momentum and reputation of its musicians through collaborations with other well-known artists, such as Afgan's collaboration with Jackson Wang. Not only that, Trinity is also a symbol of empowering new talents by relying on relevance according to its audience segment. Like Alsa Aqilah, a newcomer talent who focuses on the TikTok platform so that he can have a fairly strong fan base in the Philippines and the United States. Yonathan believes that business diversification is a superior strategy for the company. Integratively, Trinity has grown with various supporting divisions. In addition to being a driving force in the field of music production and talent marketing, Trinity has also become the first music label to handle talent development and artist management through Trinity Artist Management (TAM). In addition, Trinity also saw the rapid development of digital development trends globally and domestically, and established Trinity Creative Technology (Dignity) for digital content marketing and Trinity Publishing to handle copyright and music marketing. Trinity also continues to adapt to technological developments and continues to be a pioneer in presenting various entertainment concepts such as live streaming concerts conducted on digital channels such as Youtube or event websites. In fact, Trinity is now a pioneer in digital transformation activities. Evidently, Trinity at the end of 2020 presented a new business model in developing artist brands from internal clients and external clients who were not under the Trinity banner. As a visionary, who is also a graduate of Industrial Engineering and Information Systems and Business Administration, Northeastern University, Boston, USA, Yonathan explained that currently Trinity's market share has increased in line with the improving pandemic conditions compared to 2021. Recently, Trinity has started to venture into a venture company, namely Trinity Ventures where they have injected fresh funds into a number of start-up companies such as Sayurbox, Wahyoo, and Noice. “We see that the music business has great prospects. Not only the three startups, we also invest in e-sports. Because the world of music, entertainment, gamers are similar. Lastly, we have also started investing in a large film production house, by collaborating with Visinema in the film Stealing Raden Saleh,” So it is not surprising, with all of Trinity's achievements, Yonathan plans to make Trinity the first label company to be listed on the stock exchange through the Initial Public Offering (IPO). He admitted that he was optimistic that the Trinity shares would be in demand by market players. According to him, the entertainment industry is a business that will continue to be needed and will continue to exist, even though there should be a recession, where market conditions will be volatile or hit by uncertainty. Yonathan explained, later all the funds raised from the IPO will be used to grow Trinity, through job opportunities with investors in Indonesia and abroad. ""We will transparently show the condition of the company, that means we have credibility that can be accounted for. We will also become a trend setter as the first label in Indonesia and by going public, our market will change. Hopefully, in the next 3 to 5 years it will be realized , "" he hoped.

Fondul Proprietatea selects investment banks for Hidroelectrica IPO - the biggest in Romania's history,https://www.romania-insider.com/fondul-proprietatea-investment-banks-hidroelectrica-ipo,2022-09-09,2022-10-13 03:12:19.686149,"Franklin Templeton, Alternative Investment Fund Manager and sole director of Fondul Proprietatea, announced that the Fund and Hidroelectrica selected the consortium of investment banks, a key milestone for the planned IPO.
According to Ziarul Financiar, citing sources familiar with the deal, they are Citi, Morgan Stanley, Erste and Jefferies (global managers), Bank of America, Barclays, UBS, UniCredit and Wood (joint managers) and respectively Banca Transilvania-BCTP and Swiss Capital (co-lead managers).
The role of the selected investment banks in the IPO process is to recommend the optimal structure of the transaction, promote the equity story of Hidroelectrica among local and international investors, place securities in the IPO, as well as assist with the listing process.
“We firmly believe that the IPO and the subsequent listing of Hidroelectrica will bring significant benefits to the Romanian capital markets and Romania as a whole, as it has great potential to attract significant domestic and foreign investors for the Romanian leading electricity production company,” stated Ilinca von Derenthall, Chairperson of the Board of Nominees.
Rothschild & Co is Fondul Proprietatea's financial advisor in this transaction. Hidroelectrica's listing will take place after an initial public offer (IPO) in which Fondul Proprietatea plans to sell at least 15% of the company's shares, out of its 20% stake. The Romanian state, which holds the majority stake of 80% in Hidroelectrica, has approved the listing but is not willing to sell any shares.
Hidroelectrica is the most valuable state-owned company in Romania and, based on its recent results, probably the most valuable company overall in the country. Fondul Proprietatea's half-year report indicated an overall valuation of EUR 12.9 bln for Hidroelectrica. Based on this figure, an IPO for 15% of the company's shares would amount to over EUR 1.9 bln, which would make it by far the biggest listing in Romania's history.
Hidroelectrica was the most profitable company in Romania in 2021 and the rise in energy prices continued to push up its profits in 2022 as well.

Romania’s Hidroelectrica IPO scheduled by mid-2023,https://www.romania-insider.com/hidroelectrica-ipo-scheduled-mid-2023,2022-08-23,2022-10-13 03:12:20.131454,"The state-owned hydropower producer Hidroelectrica will have its initial public offering by the end of June of next year.
The date was agreed upon after talks between prime minister Nicoale Ciucă and other representatives of the government and a delegation from Fondul Proprietatea, a joint-stock company valued at USD 3.3 bln, established by the Romanian state but independently managed. The government reviewed the investments managed by the Fund and analyzed the preparations made for Hidroelectrica’s IPO.
The government committed to taking the company public as part of the post-pandemic recovery and resilience funds package negotiated with the EU. It is now hopeful that the IPO will develop the local capital market and also improve the governance, transparency, and efficiency of its majority state-owned companies.
Fondul Proprietatea, which is run by investment management service Franklin Templeton, currently holds 20% of Hidroelectrica, and plans to list at least a 15% stake during the IPO. The government will not contribute any of its shares to the listing. Nevertheless, Fondul Proprietatea estimated its shares to be worth around EUR 2.5 bln.
Hidroelectrica is Romania’s largest hydropower energy producer, providing roughly 30% of Romania’s electricity. In the first trimester of 2022, Hidroelectrica saw its profit skyrocket 70% relative to last year in the context of the ongoing European energy crisis.

""We are still working to carry out the listing earlier, but since November 15 is no longer a feasible deadline, the next window of opportunity is February 2023,"" FP's vice president admitted, Profit.ro reported.
Furthermore, he stressed that FP is not ready to sell at any price.
""[The company's shares] will be listed at the best time and based on the best financial results,"" he explained.
""We hope the IPO will imply a market capitalization above that level of EUR 12.5 bln [the company's value at end-June, as estimated by FP]. Taking into account the evolution of energy prices, the company has the prerequisites to exceed the level of profitability in 2021,"" Fondul Proprietatea's vice president Marius Dan said.

This is the largest IPO competed by a private company in Romania in the last four years.
The final IPO price was set at RON 5.5 per share, at the bottom end of the interval targeted by the company. The demand from retail investors was lower than in the previous IPOs carried out on the Bucharest Stock Exchange this year. Still, the tranche allotted to individual investors, which represented 15% of the total number of shares on sale, was 100% underwritten.
“Aquila completed a capital increase of RON 367 million (equivalent to EUR 74 million) through an initial public offering, this being the largest primary public offer made by a company with private shareholding through the Bucharest Stock Exchange. The successful completion of the Public Offer and the trust received from investors give us the opportunity to continue the path of expanding and consolidating the Aquila business to another level,” said Jean Dumitrescu, Investor Relations Director, Aquila.
The new shares sold in the IPO represent a third of the company’s total number of shares after the transaction. Aquila was thus valued at EUR 222 mln, which is 18.3 times more than the net profit reported for 2020 - EUR 12.1 mln.
Local brokerage firm Swiss Capital managed the IPO and BRK Financial Group and Tradeville were distribution agents. Local law firm Schoenherr si Asociatii provided the legal assistance for the IPO.

The asset's prospectus was published by the CVM in September and it was projected to raise between R$750 million and R$1 billion with the IPO. At the time, there was an expectation that the company's IPO would make room for other offers from managers, which today use more the instrument of private investment rounds to capitalize than the capital market.

Even harder than it looks,http://www.economist.com/node/17046627?story_id=17046627&fsrc=rss,,2022-10-13 03:12:36.926202,"AT FIRST glance, Vodafone has nothing to complain about. On September 8th it sold for $6.6 billion the 3.2% stake in China Mobile that it had bought for $3.3 billion between 2000 and 2002. Such a handsome profit ought to be a cue to crack open the champagne and roast some Beijing duck. Yet the British mobile-phone giant did not get what it really wanted: a way into China. In other countries, Vodafone has had a knack of turning a small investment into a controlling stake, but not in the Middle Kingdom. And it is not alone.

Since the late 1990s, several large state-owned Chinese companies have listed their shares. These initial public offerings typically included “cornerstone” investments by big Western firms. For example, BP, Exxon and Shell (three oil firms) and ABB (a Swiss-Swedish conglomerate) took strategic stakes in PetroChina and Sinopec (two big Chinese oil companies). Alcoa, an American aluminium company, invested in Chalco, a Chinese one. And Western banks bought chunks of the leading Chinese state banks when they were listed.

Foreign firms brought several things to the table: capital, technology, management skills and the prospect of better corporate governance. The Chinese press often referred to them as “elder brothers”. In return, these Western firms wanted access to China's huge domestic market.

It did not work out that way. The Chinese state-owned firms did not need capital so badly that they were prepared to cede control to foreigners. Some also found that the Westerners had less to teach them than they had hoped. “Fly-in” expat managers were often unfamiliar with China, says David Michael, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group. Chinese firms tended to learn more from multinationals that had taken the trouble to build their own large sales forces in China, he says.

Chinese firms no longer feel like little brothers. China Mobile now has a market value half as large again as Vodafone's. PetroChina is much bigger than BP. Both Chinese firms are now rich enough to buy whatever expertise they want.

Western energy companies were quick to notice this shift. BP, Shell, ABB and Exxon all sold their holdings in state-owned Chinese firms by 2005. Alcoa got out in 2007. Financial firms followed, in whole or part, during the financial crisis. When China's state-owned Agricultural Bank was recently listed, no big Western bank bought a significant stake.

Western firms grumble about their failure to turn their stakes in China Inc into a foothold in the Chinese market, but not too loudly, so that they do not annoy the government. Besides, thanks to a rising stockmarket, most made sacks of money from their investments.

A few have not yet cashed out. Telefónica, a Spanish telecoms firm, owns 8.8% of China Unicom and politely rebuffs bankers who advise it to sell. AT&T has 25% of a telecoms business in the Pudong district of Shanghai. Despite regulatory problems, it provides a nationwide service from Pudong, largely to multinational clients. It is a nice business, but a far cry from the dreams some Westerners once had about China."
Don't plant seeds in the AgBank IPO,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-plant-seeds-in-chinas-agbank-ipo-2010-06-15?reflink=MW_news_stmp,2010-06-15 00:00:00,2022-10-13 03:12:36.926202,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Last week, the Hong Kong stock exchange approved Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.'s application for a $20 billion to $30 billion initial public offering.

Hong Kong's approval now makes the Chinese bank's IPO a virtual certainty, and the stock could begin trading on both the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges by mid-July. The deal would represent the world's largest-ever IPO.

I understand how hungry investors are for picks in China right now, as 2010 has been less than fruitful for the country's equity markets after a red-hot 2009. The Shanghai Composite Index is down nearly 22% year to date. So investors should rejoice over the opportunity created by the Agricultural Bank of China IPO, right? Wrong.

While the sheer size of Agricultural Bank of China IPO is impressive, the notion that investors in the United States are going to profit mightily is far less than impressive. Read about the worst IPOs of the last year.

First off, there's the practical question of actually going about buying shares on the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges. Yes, it is possible to buy China-listed stocks from most full-service brokerage firms, but they will almost always charge you a very high premium for conducting the transaction. In certain cases, the high cost of buying Hong Kong and/or Shanghai listed securities is worth the price, particularly if you are buying a high quality company. However as you'll see, I don't think the additional cost justifies the purchase in the case of Agricultural Bank of China.

This brings us to the second reason why I'm less-than enthusiastic about this much-hyped deal, and that is the actual quality of the Agricultural Bank of China. The bank is the third-largest lender by assets of the four existing China state-owned banks, and it primarily concentrates on lending to residents in rural parts of the country. Many of these rural residents are peasants and small farmers, a class of Chinese citizen that's traditionally been much-less financially well off than their urban counterparts.

In fact, some estimates peg China's average urban resident as having about three times as much wealth as the average rural resident. China's rural population also is much less financially savvy than urban dwellers. This lack of aggregate financial wherewithal, along with limited financial knowledge, means that rural borrowers are much more likely to borrow less and default more often. Read about 12 top financial stocks to buy and 12 banks to sell.

The old adage ""follow the money"" is particularly powerful when assessing a bank's business model. In the case of Agricultural Bank of China and its rural lending focus, you might say that it's a bank that's not following the money -- and that's not a good recipe for solid earnings or strong stock performance.

In preparation for the now-imminent IPO, the Chinese government has spent the past couple of years injecting capital into Agricultural Bank of China to shore up its balance sheet. Considering that the company is more than 96%-owned by China's sovereign-wealth fund and its Ministry of Finance, this task wasn't too hard to accomplish. And though the bank has been trying to alter its business model somewhat to seek out better-quality borrowers, I expect the company will face some strong headwinds during any proposed transition. Read about five hot penny stocks for June.

The bottom line here is that I don't think U.S. investors should be planting seeds in Agricultural Bank of China's IPO. This deal may be impressive in terms of size, but it's not an investment likely to harvest much in the way of shareholder profits."

By Sui-Lee Wee and Claire Zhang

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks rose on Friday, buoyed by a bullish outlook from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and a spurt of corporate takeover talk in the financial sector, while foreign-currency-denominated B shares jumped to an 18-month high in China on speculative trade.

ICBC 1398.HK rose 2 percent to HK$6.80 after its chairman said he expected the non-performing loan situation in China's banking sector to improve next year as Chinese companies climbed out of the global economic crisis. [ID:nSP544236].

Taifook Securities 0665.HK gained 6.59 percent to HK$4.85 after rising as much as 9.9 percent to its highest since January 2008. Reuters reported on Thursday that China Construction Bank 0939.HK was in talks to buy control of the brokerage to give it a solid footing in Hong Kong's lucrative retail securities market. [ID:nHKG329606]

Bank of East Asia 0023.HK , Hong Kong's No.5 bank, was the top loser among index heavyweights after the lender said it was not in talks on a potential acquisition. [ID:nHKG328800] The stock fell 3.67 percent to HK$32.80.

Rumours that Malaysian conglomerate Guoco Group 0053.HK could be interested in BEA had sent the bank's shares up 26 percent in the last two days.

Brokers said the flurry of takeover talk was fueling optimism about share values.

""Every couple of years, we have takeover stories on Hong Kong banks,"" said Howard Gorges, director at South China Brokerage. ""People are punting and chasing stories in second-line companies.""

""There's certainly some catch-up value (in these stocks) compared with the big ones. It's a reflection of the amount of cash around and underlying confidence in the market,"" he said.

The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI rose 0.7 percent or 156.06 points to 22,553.63, up 3.3 percent on the week.

Turnover was almost unchanged at HK$70 billion, from Thursday's HK$70.95 billion.

The China Enterprises Index of top locally listed mainland Chinese stocks .HSCE rose 1.03 percent to 13,461.79.

Simsen International 0993.HK jumped as much as 52 percent to HK$0.47 intraday, its highest since November 2007, after the brokerage said its controlling shareholders were in preliminary talks with a potential acquirer. The stock closed at HK$0.40, up 29.03 percent.

Shui On Construction and Materials Ltd 0983.HK rose 7.93 percent to HK$12.52 after Reuters reported that the company and Lafarge LAFP.PA , the world's largest cement maker, were set to spin off their cement joint venture, hoping to raise $500 million-$600 million from a Hong Kong initial public offering in 2010.

SHANGHAI RISES, BUOYED BY ROSY OUTLOOK

China's key stock index edged up 0.46 percent, boosted by the upbeat outlook for the economy and company earnings.

The Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC ended at 3,187,647 points, reversing losses early in the session and securing a 0.7 percent gain for the week.

Gaining Shanghai A shares outnumbered losers by 601 to 270 while turnover rose to 163 billion yuan ($23.88 billion) from WednesSay's 144 billion yuan.

Shanghai's index of U.S. dollar-denominated B shares .SSEB ended up 9.42 percent at 251.192 points, close to its 10 percent daily limit, while volume nearly tripled from the previous day to $326.5 million on the thinly traded market.

Market sources said long-running speculation resurfaced about a possible merger with the far larger yuan-denominated A-share market or a requirement for companies to buy back B shares.

Both moves would likely favour B shares, which are undervalued compared to their A-share counterparts.

Analysts also cited rising expectations of yuan appreciation as favourable for B shares, which are denominated in U.S. dollars in Shanghai and U.S. dollar-linked Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen, while the companies hold yuan-denominated assets.

""Investors could wait to see if any actual policy comes out over the weekend regarding B shares. Otherwise, B shares may be hit by profit-taking next week,"" said Zhang Xiang, chief strategist at Guodu Securities in Beijing.

Official media on Friday quoted Fan Jianping, chief economist with the State Information Centre, as saying that China's economic recovery was exceeding expectations and that full-year growth would be about 8.3 percent. [ID:nSHA79146]

The stock index is likely to rise slightly next week, Zhang said, but added that significant gains were unlikely in the near term, after a sustained rally early this month, and that it would resistance at 3,200 points.

Although ChiNext is tiny when compared with the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges, regulators hope it will eventually compete with Nasdaq and entice more Chinese companies to list with it.

ChiNext is also expected to give a boost to venture capital and private equity markets in mainland China, which have been hampered by a system that until now has not provided investors with what industry insiders call an exit strategy — a way of eventually cashing out of their investments in small companies through a domestic stock market.

There are big challenges to creating a stock board similar to Nasdaq, which includes companies like Microsoft, Intel and Google. For instance, volatile stock prices and high valuations could hurt the new board’s credibility with entrepreneurs and investors.

Chinese investors are known to speculate, favoring momentum buying and selling rather than the underlying fundamentals of a company, analysts say. Indeed, the casinolike nature of the Shanghai stock exchange and the main Shenzhen board, combined with government intervention, have added to the volatility of the mainland markets.

Analysts warn that ChiNext could also be prone to similar speculative frenzies.

Andy Xie, an economist who formerly worked at Morgan Stanley, is already calling ChiNext a “V.I.P. table on top of a big casino.”

Chang Chun, an expert on financial markets at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, said that China needed a market to serve start-ups, but “the issue is the maturity of Chinese investors.”"

Grimstone and Philp played leading roles in talks with SoftBank over the U.K. listing.Son is set to ask the Samsung chief to forge a strategic alliance with Arm, while the Korean chipmaker appears to be somewhat stumped, saying that it has no idea what Son's business proposal could be. Samsung didn't elaborate further. After President Yoon Suk-yeol granted a pardon for the Samsung leader, the company's top executives are increasingly being asked to implement very detailed and applicable business plans to boost shareholder returns amid a slowdown in demand for memory chips. Samsung's share price fell some 30 percent from January to Sept. 23, while South Korea's benchmark KOSPI index was down 23 percent during the same period, according to data provided by the Korea Exchange (KRX).Samsung Electronics had some 6 million minority shareholders as of today following its 50-to-1 stock split in 2018. Senior company executives said that Samsung, which is a leader in the global memory chip industry, is on track to explore acquisition opportunities in order to secure future growth engines.However, despite repeated positive comments by Samsung executives over the progress of its corporate acquisition efforts, several sources familiar with the issues said chances are low that Samsung will pursue a sizable stake in the British chip designer.""First, the departures of the two British ministers mean a lot because they were strong supporters in backing Son's idea for Arm's London initial public offering (IPO). SoftBank will pursue a direct U.S. listing of Arm. Its founder Son needs Samsung's support for Arm's successful U.S. listing process,"" a senior industry executive said via telephone, asking not to be named.In June this year, Son told investors and shareholders that he was in favor of a U.S. listing because most of Arm's clients are based there. Plus, its CEO Rene Haas recently told the Financial Times that Arm wants to use the capital raised from its upcoming IPO to look at pursuing deals. ""Arm executives are pretty confident the company can stand on its own two feet. The timing is good for us,"" Hass was quoted as saying. The U.S. market is much better than London in terms of liquidity and the number of prospective larger investors. Meanwhile, Arm's battle over control of its China unit, earlier considered the biggest hurdle to pursuing an IPO, has been resolved. Samsung could play role of financial investor Simply put, SoftBank is in severe financial trouble because of the global sell-off of technology stocks.

However, despite repeated positive comments by Samsung executives over the progress of its corporate acquisition efforts, several sources familiar with the issues said chances are low that Samsung will pursue a sizable stake in the British chip designer.  ""First, the departures of the two British ministers mean a lot because they were strong supporters in backing Son's idea for Arm's London initial public offering (IPO). SoftBank will pursue a direct U.S. listing of Arm. Its founder Son needs Samsung's support for Arm's successful U.S. listing process,"" a senior industry executive said via telephone, asking not to be named.  In June this year, Son told investors and shareholders that he was in favor of a U.S. listing because most of Arm's clients are based there. Plus, its CEO Rene Haas recently told the Financial Times that Arm wants to use the capital raised from its upcoming IPO to look at pursuing deals. ""Arm executives are pretty confident the company can stand on its own two feet. The timing is good for us,"" Hass was quoted as saying.   The U.S. market is much better than London in terms of liquidity and the number of prospective larger investors. Meanwhile, Arm's battle over control of its China unit, earlier considered the biggest hurdle to pursuing an IPO, has been resolved.    Simply put, SoftBank is in severe financial trouble because of the global sell-off of technology stocks. Gains made through its investment arm, Vision Funds, in tech startups including Alibaba, Coupang and Doordash were almost wiped out.   Son said he was ashamed of himself for being so elated by big profits in the past. Son drastically scaled back investments as Vision Fund spent $600 million in new investments in the first quarter of this year down from $20.6 billion in the same period, a year ago.""While Samsung's cash reserves were at some 130 trillion won, as of August this year, it is unlikely for Samsung to serve as a kind of white knight to save SoftBank by purchasing major stakes in Arm because there's no need to do so,"" another executive said on condition of anonymity. The entire value of Arm is estimated at some 95 trillion won, at least. Samsung has acquired 29 companies including seven in the last five years. A total of four acquisitions happened from private equity firms (PEFs). It also divested a total of seven assets. Samsung's largest-ever acquisition was in 2016 when the company bought Harman for $8 billion. It has acquired in seven different U.S. states and nine countries, while the company's most preferred target sectors include software products and software services, according to company disclosures.""Recent failed attempts at blockbuster deal proposals were due to regulatory concerns regarding national security and competition. Samsung may take a role as a financial investor through the participation of Arm's U.S. IPO process by purchasing large volumes of new shares, for example,"" the executive added. SoftBank owns a 75 percent stake in Arm with Vision Funds owning the remaining 25 percent. Son hopes to remain as the largest shareholder in it by only selling the stakes owned by Vision Funds, said sources close to the matter. ""SoftBank wants to ensure prospective Wall Street investors that its $60 billion valuation target for Arm is supported by major partners including Samsung. In fact, Son hopes to use his meeting with Samsung's Lee as a bar to boost the financial value of Arm in the eyes of other buyers,"" said an executive by telephone at a local PEF, who has previously handled sizable deals. ""Investor sentiment for semiconductor stocks will recover from early next year.""ASML case, no huge synergy even for a part of Arm Citing a top industry official, The Korea Times was the first to report Samsung's plan to acquire between a 3 percent and a 5 percent stake in Arm as a way to reduce payable royalties. The reports also went on to say that Arm will be acquired by a consortium led by multiple parties given the complex nature of Arm's shareholding structure. Samsung responded to this by saying the story was ""groundless.""  Son said he was ashamed of himself for being so elated by big profits in the past. Son drastically scaled back investments as Vision Fund spent $600 million in new investments in the first quarter of this year down from $20.6 billion in the same period, a year ago.

Samsung responded to this by saying the story was ""groundless.""  ""As Samsung's major clients want to build up a consortium for a part of Arm because of antitrust concerns, Samsung may join on this as a gesture to show its backing of industry collaboration,"" said Lee Ju-wan, a researcher at POSCO Research Institute. Earlier, Qualcomm expressed its interest in purchasing a stake in Arm as part of an investment consortium, if necessary, in a way to allay regulatory scrutiny about competition. One key trend seen in the global M&A industry is that there is a lot of pressure from governments on businesses to cooperate. While pursuing a deal via a strategic long-term partnership isn't the classic M&A formula, this would give industries and interested parties more flexibility in terms of tackling common challenges. In 2012, Samsung purchased minor stakes in ASML alongside Intel and TSMC as a financial investor. The stake acquisition did not include voting rights. Four years later, Samsung halved its holdings of ASML to 1.5 percent. Citing the ASML case, market observers say Samsung may review the possibility of acquiring a part of Arm as the chip designer is aiming to push beyond mobile phone technology and deeper into components for next-generation vehicles, data centers, networking equipment and hardware underpinning the metaverse.Arm is strategically important for Samsung. In the chip industry, with major consolidation off the table, industry officials say the small volume of transactions will become the norm, along with increased industry collaboration. Within that context, if Samsung joins the race for a part of Arm with Qualcomm, Apple and Intel, some say there won't be any huge monopoly and/or competition issues.Citing Samsung's strengths in chip manufacturing, Jim Handy, a seasoned chip expert, claimed Samsung's total acquisition of Arm would not raise concerns when considered against the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a measurement of market monopoly that is used to determine market competitiveness. Handy added that because Samsung isn't a processor company, Samsung won't face severe antitrust issues unlike complaints and objections at the time of Arm's attempts to acquire Nvidia.Nonetheless, because Arm's core strengths are based on mobile, buying large chunks is not in Samsung's best interests given its shift toward non-mobile businesses. ""Samsung wants to broaden its key business portfolios for corporate clients and that means avoidance of any conflict of interest with its clients is necessary for Samsung from a profit standpoint. If Arm is acquired by Samsung, then Arm's clients will have greater concerns over technology leaks,"" Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at Eugene Investment, said. Arm generates its profit from licensing and royalty fees paid by its clients including Samsung, Apple and Qualcomm, which use its patented chip designs to produce their own hardware. No powerful synergy effects are expected from Samsung's acquisition of Arm as Samsung aims to become the top foundry chip service provider by 2030, the promising market is currently led by TSMC of Taiwan. ""From Arm's standpoint, it wants to go beyond mobile and this is also true for Samsung; therefore, participating in Arm's U.S. IPO process as a financial investor might make sense for Samsung. But buying even a part of Arm via a consortium is an idea that needs to be developed and reviewed thoroughly,"" said Lee Jong-hwan, a professor of system semiconductor studies at Sangmyung University.

Kyobo Life mulls over listing on US stock market ,https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2022/09/602_335670.html,06-09-2022,2022-10-13,"Life insurer seeks alternative following rejection by KRXBy Anna J. ParkKyobo Life is examining the option of pursuing an overseas listing on the U.S. stock market, as its attempt to go public on the Korean stock market was denied two months ago. According to financial industry sources on Tuesday, the life insurer has begun internal discussions on the topic of going public on the U.S. stock market with a preference for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).It's not the first time that the life insurer has examined the option of an overseas listing. Kyobo Life had also studied and considered going public on other major stock markets, including those of the U.S., Hong Kong, Shanghai and London. Back then, the option was more considered long-term strategic planning for the company's various possible listing scenarios, given that major local financial groups like KB and Shinhan are successfully dual-listed on the Korean and U.S. stock markets. However, market watchers say Kyobo Life's discussions on the overseas listing this time around seem to be more related to seeking an alternative breakthrough for the firm's growth, as the company's listing efforts on the Korean stock market had met a major obstacle. The company's application for a preliminary round of IPO assessment earlier this year at the Korea Exchange (KRX), the operator of local bourse markets, was turned down in July due to ongoing legal disputes among the firm's major shareholders. Kyobo Life has been mired in years-long legal disputes with its financial investors, including Hong Kong-based Affinity Equity Partners, both at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and in local courts over issues related to the financial investors' right to exercise their put options. Although the KRX does not publicly announce reasons for turning down a company's IPO application, market watchers view that the unending legal disputes among shareholders played a key role in the KRX's decision not to allow the life insurer's listing on the local stock market. It is the first case in the past three years that the KRX declined to give the green light to a company that applied for the preliminary IPO assessment to go public on the country's main benchmark KOSPI market. Regarding the possibility of pursing a listing on the U.S. stock market, Kyobo Life responded that nothing is set for the time being, while acknowledging that the overseas listing has been mulled over as one option among the firm's possible future moves. ""Nothing has changed about Kyobo Life's pursuance of an IPO for the sake of the firm's long-term development and growth. As the possibility of going public on the local stock market in the immediate future is uncertain, the company has been examining various alternatives, including listing on the U.S. stock market. Yet, nothing specific has been decided regarding the U.S. listing plan,"" an official at Kyobo Life told The Korea Times.    By Anna J.

Kyobo Life has been mired in years-long legal disputes with its financial investors, including Hong Kong-based Affinity Equity Partners, both at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and in local courts over issues related to the financial investors' right to exercise their put options.   Although the KRX does not publicly announce reasons for turning down a company's IPO application, market watchers view that the unending legal disputes among shareholders played a key role in the KRX's decision not to allow the life insurer's listing on the local stock market. It is the first case in the past three years that the KRX declined to give the green light to a company that applied for the preliminary IPO assessment to go public on the country's main benchmark KOSPI market.   Regarding the possibility of pursing a listing on the U.S. stock market, Kyobo Life responded that nothing is set for the time being, while acknowledging that the overseas listing has been mulled over as one option among the firm's possible future moves.   ""Nothing has changed about Kyobo Life's pursuance of an IPO for the sake of the firm's long-term development and growth. As the possibility of going public on the local stock market in the immediate future is uncertain, the company has been examining various alternatives, including listing on the U.S. stock market. Yet, nothing specific has been decided regarding the U.S. listing plan,"" an official at Kyobo Life told The Korea Times.  "

The new international and domestic investors join the previously announced 11 renowned, global long-term cornerstone investors in making up Monde Nissin’s initial shareholder base.
  “The extraordinary level of interest that we received from a broad range of international and domestic investors is a testament to the world-class company that we have built and the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead,” said Henry Soesanto, Chief Executive Officer of Monde Nissin Corporation.

Quorn is a leading player in the fast-growing global meat alternatives segment with a loyal customer following and a defining set of healthy sustainable products. Our Asia-Pacific Branded Food and Beverage business is widely recognized for its leadership positions across each of its core segments. We intend to stay ahead of consumer demands through innovation and investment in technology to provide healthier and more delicious food.”
  Mr. Soesanto concluded by saying, “The scale and timing of our IPO has only been made possible through the hard work and guidance of the dedicated teams at the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission and the PSE, to whom I extend my sincere gratitude and thanks.”

As the market leader in monetizing TRAs, Parallaxes is dedicated to increasing the visibility and transparency of TRAs which remain an often overlooked and misunderstood asset class.

Athlon disclosed that after having been acquired by Encana Corporation (""Encana""), Encana will be making an aggregate cash payment of approximately $25 million to TRA holders to satisfy obligations under the TRA. The Athlon TRA provided for the payment of 85% of the net cash tax savings realized from certain tax attributes, including savings from (i) increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to exchanges of subsidiary units and (ii) payments under the TRA.
Parallaxes views TRAs, including the Athlon TRA, as a valuable tool to reduce certain moral hazard problems and informational asymmetry inherent in a company's public offering.

Parallaxes anticipates enhanced awareness and understanding of TRAs will drive increased market adoption.

Comcast Corporation (""Comcast"") disclosed that after having acquired DreamWorks, it settled the DreamWorks TRA with an aggregate cash payment of $146 million. The DreamWorks TRA was entered into with an affiliate of Paul Allen (the ""TRA Entity"") as DreamWorks benefited from increases to the tax basis of its assets as a result of transactions with affiliates of the TRA Entity. The DreamWorks TRA had provided for the payment of 85% of the cash tax savings realized from such tax basis increases, subject to repayment if such savings were not available to DreamWorks.
Parallaxes views TRAs, including the DreamWorks TRA, as a valuable tool to reduce certain moral hazard problems and informational asymmetry inherent in a company's public offering. TRAs help ensure that pre-IPO owners are economically aligned with new public shareholders and incentivize pre-IPO owners to pursue an IPO structure that provides the company with ongoing tax benefits. Parallaxes anticipates enhanced awareness and understanding of TRAs will drive increased market adoption.

"Indonesia B2C e-Commerce Markets 2022: Market is Expected to Grow by 19% to Reach $37.8 Billion in 2022 - Social Commerce Startups are Raising Funding Rounds to Expand
",https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/indonesia-b2c-e-commerce-markets-2022-market-is-expected-to-grow-by-19-to-reach-37-8-billion-in-2022---social-commerce-startups-are-raising-funding-rounds-to-expand-301643565.html,"Oct 07, 2022, 08:00 ET",2022-10-13 03:20:57.347364,"
DUBLIN, Oct. 7, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The ""Indonesia B2C Ecommerce Market Opportunities Databook - 100+ KPIs on Ecommerce Verticals (Shopping, Travel, Food Service, Media & Entertainment, Technology), Market Share by Key Players, Sales Channel Analysis, Payment Instrument, Consumer Demographics - Q2 2022 Update"" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
The market in Indonesia is expected to grow by 19.00% on annual basis to reach US$37.8 billion in 2022
The medium to the long-term growth story of the B2C Ecommerce industry in Indonesia promises to be attractive . The B2C Ecommerce is expected to grow steadily over the forecast period, recording a CAGR of 15.56% during 2022-2026. The country's B2C Ecommerce Gross Merchandise Value will increase from US$31.7 billion in 2021 to reach US$67.3 billion by 2026.
The global pandemic outbreak and social distancing measures implemented to manage Covid-19 led to the growth of the B2C e-commerce market worldwide, as the pandemic confined most people to their homes. The stay-at-home protocol also accelerated the growth of online transactions globally, and Indonesia is no exception. Ecommerce transactions as a share of total retail sales are also higher in Indonesia compared to other developed markets such as the United States, France, Spain, and Sweden.
The country is set to become one of the largest digital economies in the Southeast Asia region, with approximately 40% of the total regional market share. The young population of Indonesia is expected to play a crucial role in driving the industry's growth in the short to medium term.
In terms of the competitive landscape, homegrown e-commerce marketplaces such as Tokopedia and Shopee are still leading the e-commerce sector. These players have widened their market share over the competitors, including Lazada, Bukalapak, Blibli, and JD.com Indonesia.
Each of these e-commerce marketplaces in the country has a unique advantage. For instance, Shopee has a closed loop ecosystem with its logistics and payments services, while the merger of Tokopedia with Gojek offers more resources to the firm. On the contrary, the mitra program of Bukalapak focuses on mom-and-pop stores across the country. While there are a lot of differentiating factors, all of these players also become similar in many aspects, including marketing content, free delivery service, and promotional efforts.
Firms are raising funding through a public offering to s support their growth strategy in Indonesia
Amid the rising competition in the Indonesian e-commerce industry and the market's expected growth over the next three to four years, firms raise funding through a public offering to support their growth strategy.

GoTo, an Indonesian startup formed by a merger between e-commerce marketplace Tokopedia and ride-hailing giant Gojek, raised US$1.1 billion through an initial public offering scheduled for 4 April 2022. The merged entity GoTo, which has three businesses - ride-hailing, e-commerce, and financial services - under a single ecosystem, is planning to use the public offering proceeds to support its growth strategy.
The firm also raised US$1.3 billion in its pre-IPO in 2021 from investors including Google, Softbank, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Temasek, Tencent, and Fidelity International. In March 2022, the firm said its total addressable market in the country is projected to increase to US$137.5 billion in 2025 from US$44.6 billion in 2020. This shows that the firm will continue to grow its market share in the e-commerce segment from the short to medium-term perspective.
In August 2021, Bukalapak, another e-commerce firm in Indonesia, raised US$1.5 billion through a public offering, which valued the firm at US$6 billion. Apart from GoTo and Bukalapak, which have already raised a funding round public offerings, Blibli, another Indonesian e-commerce firm, is understood to have plans for raising US$500 million through IPO. The potential listing of Blibli is expected to occur at the end of June or July 2022.

Social commerce startups are raising funding rounds to expand in more markets
The social commerce space has flourished in Indonesia over the last two years, with many innovative startups entering the market. After gaining widespread popularity in Indonesia, these startups seek to expand into new markets. Consequently, social commerce startups are raising funding rounds.

In June 2022, Dagangan, a rural social e-commerce startup in Indonesia, announced that the firm had raised US$6.6 million funding in its pre-series B funding round, which was led by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) subsidiary, BTPN Syariah Ventura. The investment round is part of the firm's strategy to expand into newer markets while also improving its product capabilities. Notably, the e-commerce platform offers same-day or next-day delivery for a wide range of household products, including foods and apparel, among several others.
In September 2021, Evermos, another social commerce startup from Indonesia, announced that the firm had raised US$30 million in its series B funding round led by UOB Venture Management.

Online travel firms are looking to raise funding rounds to further accelerate their growth in the market
With the travel industry expected to record a strong recovery over the next three to four years, players in the segment are raising funding rounds to further accelerate their growth and consolidate their position as the market leader.

In June 2022, Skift reported that Traveloka, the leading travel-based platform in Indonesia, is planning to raise more than US$200 million in a funding round. As of June 2022, the firm had raised a total of US$1.2 billion across six investment rounds, including the US$250 million round in July 2020, which was led by the Qatar Investment Authority.
In Indonesia, Traveloka is the biggest online travel agency having a market share of 43%. The firm, along with Agoda and Booking.com, also dominates the online travel sector in Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. This funding round will help the firm to further grow its businesses and valuation, which will also support Traveloka in issuing the public offering at an attractive price in the future.

On-demand grocery delivery startups are raising funding rounds for product development and customer acquisition
As in many countries around the world, the on-demand delivery segment is also gaining popularity in Indonesia. This has led to many existing and new players entering the e-grocery segment over the last two years. With the market becoming increasingly competitive, startups are raising funding for product development and customer acquisition. For instance,

In May 2022, Astro, which offers a 15-minute grocery delivery service, announced that the firm had raised US$60 million in its series B funding round. The May 2022 investment takes the total funding raised by the firm to US$90 since its inception in 2021. The investment round led by Accel, Tiger Global, and Citius will be used for product development and customer acquisition.
In March 2022, Sayurbox also announced that the firm had raised US$120+ million in its series C funding round, which was led by Northstar and Alpha JWC Ventures.

In the online grocery space, the quick commerce segment is also gaining rapid momentum, with startups looking to deliver orders within 10 minutes to consumers in the country. Startups in the rapid grocery spare are also raising funding rounds.

In February 2022, Bananas, the rapid commerce startup in Indonesia, announced that the firm had raised US$1 million in its seed funding round to speed up the process of grocery delivery.

 Metinvest Mining and Metallurgical Group is currently guided by the company's development strategy until 2030 and is developing a strategy until 2050, Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov said in an interview with Forbes-Ukraine.
""Our strategy is calculated until 2030. We are finalizing it until 2050,"" the top manager said, adding that the 2030 strategy has an option to enter an IPO, ""but everything will depend, of course, on our financial burden.""
At the same time, Ryzhenkov noted that there is an overestimation of the advantages of publicity.
""Ferrexpo is a public company, but it is still attacked for being oligarchic and paying little rent. So it is more from the sphere of political technologies ... Thanks to the fact that we have two shareholders, our willingness to IPO is high from the point of view of corporate governance, and from the point of view of reporting. Sometimes the question even arises, why bear the burden of a public company without receiving corresponding benefits. If it was decided to go to the stock exchange, we could do it in a year and a half. Question: what for?"" he said.
At the same time, he clarified that it would be more correct to address the issue of IPO to shareholders.
""As a hired manager, I must be guided by financial and economic logic. The logic of any placement - debt or equity - is quite simple. The company has a development strategy. If it does not have enough money, it primarily uses debt instruments, because it is the cheapest capital. The most expensive is shares. As long as the company is able to serve its development needs through debt markets, there is absolutely no economic incentive to go public. By the way, if Metinvest were a public company, we would have given up investing in Mariupol back in 2014 and everything would have been closed there, because any public investors would say: what $ 150 million investments - they shoot at you there,"" the top manager explained.
According to Ryzhenkov, the largest crisis in the history of Metinvest was in 2013–2015.

Investment company Dragon Capital, one of the leading in the Ukrainian market, currently manages funds with a total value of assets of about $800 million, compared with about $700 million at the beginning of this year, the founder and CEO of the investment company Dragon Capital, Tomas Fiala, has said.
""We continue attracting investors to the funds we create. After EVF (Europe Virgin Fund), we created DCNUF (Dragon Capital New Ukraine Fund) and three more real estate funds. We have co-investors everywhere. We manage these funds ourselves and invest our own funds there,"" he said in an exclusive interview with Interfax-Ukraine.
Fiala said that the share of Dragon Capital in each of these funds is from 35% to 51%, which allows other investors to make a decision on investing much more comfortably.
The head of Dragon Capital also announced plans for the company to remain private. ""We are not planning an IPO or attracting an investor to the Dragon Capital holding. We continue attracting investors to the funds that we create,"" he said, adding that Ukraine remains the main market for investment.
According to Fiala, in the absence of the rule of law in Ukraine and an undeveloped stock market, Dragon Capital is more focused not on portfolio investments, but on investments, where it acts as a majority shareholder – both in private equity and in real estate. ""We have significantly more resources, both physical and monetary, focused specifically on direct investments, and not on trading and brokerage,"" the investment banker said.
Commenting on recent transactions outside the real estate sector, in particular the purchase Aqua-Eco (Truskavets, Lviv region), which extracts, produces and sells natural waters under the Truskavetska trademark, from the international group IDS Borjomi International, Fiala said that this company was put up for sale and was bought after rather lengthy negotiations. According to him, the company has been following this market since the early 2000s, and now has a partner with extensive experience in this area, which has not yet become one of the shareholders of Aqua-Eco.
""This is similar to the story with the bank [recently, Dragon Capital, together with ex-head of Alfa-Bank Ivan Svitek, acquired Unex-Bank], when there is a synergy between us and a specialized co-investor, who in the future will be a minority shareholder and co-managing partner of this project,"" the head of the investment company said.
He confirmed that Dragon Capital still has no plans to enter crop assets. ""If the market were more liberal, we would have considered the option of buying farmland and partnerships with farmers. They would be interested in attracting us as a financial investor. We would buy the land and lease it to them for 20 years. But in the form in which this law was passed, it is not very attractive for us,"" Fiala added.
He also said that he is thinking about investing in the subsoil, but there are still many risks associated with state regulation in this sector. In this regard, Fiala recalled that Dragon Capital remains committed to investing in the industry, ""where there is less overlap with government regulation and with officials, where there are fewer risks.""
He also said that the investment banking department of the company now has many M&A tasks: agriculture, IT and other industries, as well as eurobonds. ""We are planning to participate in another placement of eurobonds in the near future. There are many plans and tasks in this direction now,"" the head of Dragon Capital said.
When asked about the likelihood of a Ukrainian IPO, which has been paused for more than 10 years, Fiala predicted what an initial public offering would be. ""But, more likely, it will be from the IT sector, e-commerce, from some kind of new economy. And it will certainly be on the external market – most likely in London,"" the investment banker said.

Private laboratory market to exceed EUR 1 bln by late 2021 – opinion,https://en.interfax.com.ua//news/economic/768078.html,"

",2022-10-13 03:21:01.405711,"

Over 2021, the private laboratory market will exceed EUR 1 billion, Commercial Director of Synevo Mykola Skavronsky has said.
""According to our rough estimates, if in 2019 the private laboratory market in Ukraine was somewhere around EUR 200-250 million, then this year we will cross the figure in EUR 1 billion. The market has now doubled in recent years, that is, it goes exponentially,"" he told Interfax-Ukraine.
According to Skavronsky, ""when this market exploded, many new operators appeared here,"" while existing companies are developing, and regional ones are beginning to ""run over to neighboring and not quite neighboring distant regions.""
He said that in such a situation, one of the main strategies of Synevo is to try to retain the existing market share, ""although we clearly understand that we will lose it.""
""It's hard enough to maintain the same market share when you don't pay doctors. At the same time, we will go into digitalization as much as possible,"" the company's commercial director said.
Skavronsky said that one of the directions of Synevo's strategy at present will be, among other things, strengthening relations with partners, remarketing the patient base, including in the interests of clinics that cooperate with Synevo.
Synevo is the largest network of laboratories in Ukraine, part of the Swedish medical holding Medicover. The Synevo network includes 320 laboratory centers operating in 125 settlements of Ukraine, as well as eight laboratories in which more than 1,000 types of tests are performed.
The laboratory centers of the company serve more than 4 million clients annually.
In 2017, Synevo, as part of the Medicover holding, carried out an IPO on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Thus, Synevo became the first and only medical company in Ukraine which shares are listed on the international stock exchange.
Since 2007, the Medicover holding has invested over EUR 50 million in the development of the company.

"Office of National Investment Council proposes to create state fund of funds, national investment fund with shares of large SOEs for holding IPO",https://en.interfax.com.ua//news/economic/718087.html,"

 The Office of the National Investment Council under the President of Ukraine proposes to create the State Fund of Funds and the National Investment Fund (NIF) with shares of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) for holding an IPO, Head of the Office Olha Mahaletska has said.
""Among the initiatives that are proposed to be considered for the National Economic Strategy of Ukraine is the creation of a National Investment Fund for the transformation of state-owned enterprises, the stakes in which will be under its management, into effective and profitable companies, as well as the State Fund of Funds. It will activate the development of the investment fund industry,"" she said, presenting the Office's proposals to the National Strategy until 2030.
The expected effect of the launch of the State Fund of Funds exceeds 1% of GDP, Mahaletska added.
According to her, the State Fund of Funds invests in other funds instead of directly investing in stocks and bonds of companies. The mechanism of operation is the financing of investment funds that have already received investments from a limited list of first-class foreign investors, such as the EBRD and IFC.
The seed capital of the State Fund of Funds will be the national budget of Ukraine (10-20%) and international financial institutions (IFIs, 80-90%).
Earlier, the government of the country considered the possibility of creating a ""fund of funds"" to support Ukrainian startups on the basis of public-private partnerships. However, instead, in 2019, the Ministry of Finance launched the Ukrainian Startup Fund.
As for the NIF, it is proposed at the first stage to transfer shares of 10-15 large state-owned enterprises to its management, and in the future this number can be increased, Mahaletska said.
According to her, the main task of such an investment fund is to increase the efficiency of state-owned enterprises through the corporatization. In particular, the NIF will be able to appoint its representatives to the company's supervisory boards.
""The task of the highest level is to prepare the enterprise for an initial public offering of its shares on a stock exchange,"" Mahaletska said.
Earlier, Head of the National Securities and Stock Market Commission Tymur Khromaev proposed to create a National Investment Fund, which will include minority stakes in about 20-30 strategic enterprises. The IPO of this fund will increase the investment attractiveness of Ukraine and provide the prerequisites for a successful IPO for these enterprises.
In recent years, the idea of creating a National Welfare Fund has been promoted by the National Securities and Stock Market Commission, citing as an example the successful experience of such a fund in Romania and a number of other countries. However, these proposals were met with no response until recently.

"Investment results of 2020: new companies on the stock market, unpredictability, and records",https://en.interfax.com.ua//news/blog/717798.html,"
15:18
21.01.2021
",2022-10-13 03:21:02.918768,"

Vadym Antsyferov, investor, co-founder & CEO of international companies GoMage and Sellbery
 
2020 was unique and unpredictable from different points of view, including in the context of the investment market. It was impossible to foresee the March collapse of the shares of so many companies. Sales, incredibly high risks - no one was able to understand what would happen next. Those who risked in time were mostly in a winning position because they ""found the bottom."" All they had to do was wait for fear and panic to turn into huge profits.
General market realities
The market rally (steady rise in prices) in 2020 happened in the midst of a disastrous pandemic. It has claimed more than 1.8 million lives in the past year, shut down many businesses, completely destroyed some, canceled mass travel, and damaged economies. At the same time, trillions of dollars were spent on saving the global economy (especially in the United States). This, along with ultra-low rates, fueled the insatiable appetites of greedy investors.
2020 has been a stellar year for the American stock market. But the opportunities that it opened were not applicable to everyone. To use them, one had to have more than just experience in investing. An important role was played by endurance and belief that the market would not only recover but also fix new highs.
Demonstrating market jumps is very simple. The Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index in March 2020 fell to 18,213.65 points, and the S&P 500 index to 2,191.86. The former closed the year with an indicator of 30.421.14 points, and the latter - of 3.756.07, respectively.
IPO boom
In 2020, there was a real boom in the IPO (initial public offering) market. According to Stock Analysis, as of December 30, 480 companies entered the US exchanges - last year there were only 233 of them, that is, half as many.
According to Bloomberg estimates, companies that have carried out IPOs raised nearly $ 180 billion in the US market. Here are some of the most successful examples:

Snowflake, a cloud storage company, went public on September 15. The price for December 31 is $ 281.4, with an increase of 134.5%.
Palantir, a data analytics software company for organizations, went public on September 30, priced at $ 23.55 as of December 31, with an increase of 214%.
Airbnb (an online marketplace for renting private housing around the world), went public on December 9, the price on December 31 was $ 146.8, with an increase of 116%.
DoorDash (an American food delivery service), went public on December 8, the price on December 31 - $ 142.75, with an increase of 40%.

Investor Lessons

The stock market doesn't always reflect the economy
	When the stock bottomed on March 23rd and began to rally, many investors were at a loss. The number of COVID-19 cases has skyrocketed. Restaurants, shops, and theaters have closed, and millions of Americans have lined up to apply for unemployment benefits. How could the market work so well when the world was crumbling?

The fact is that the stock market often begins to recover much earlier than the economy. During the financial crisis, American stocks fell on March 9, 2009. But, while the stock market began to go up after some time, seven years have passed for the unemployment rate to fall below the pre-crisis level.
In 2020, the situation is similar. The stocks have managed to rise to unprecedented records throughout the year. However, many American economists say they do not expect a full recovery of jobs lost during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2023.

Forecasts are just forecasts and nothing more

For the past year, leading Wall Street strategists have forecast and identified the biggest risk in the markets - deteriorating trade relations between the US and China. But trading almost completely disappeared from the radars of many money management experts in early 2020. This topic quickly gave way to concerns about a pandemic and economic downturn.
According to The Wall Street Journal, experts also predicted modest earnings for the S&P 500. By March 2020, analysts at leading wealth management companies BMO Capital Markets and Oppenheimer Asset Management said they were revising their forecasts by the end of the year due to the current market situation. Others cut their targets after the spring sale, only to pick them up again after the summer rally. Investment Bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its year-end numbers to 3,000 in March, then raised them to 3,600 in August and 3,700 in November. The index closed the year at 3756.07.
During a pandemic, no one can know how events will develop, so forecasts simply do not work.

A year of tech giants and incredible discoveries

This is what The Wall Street Journal quite rightly calls this year.
In 2020 Tesla Inc. became the most valuable car manufacturer in the world. And Airbnb debuted on the public market with a score higher than Marriott International Inc., Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., and Hyatt Hotels Corp. put together.
Many tech companies have benefited disproportionately from the pandemic, which has forced people to spend more time at home and online. Just a couple of examples: Zoom Video Communications Inc. grew 396% in a year, which is about 24 times the profit of the S&P 500. And online retailer Etsy Inc. added 302%.

Patience, patience again

Sometimes the best reaction to events is no reaction. Often new introductory, unforeseen realities, which this year were many times more than stability, make investors panic, go the wrong way and lose a lot. For example, starting in February, the shares of many companies could fall by 10-20% in a few days. Needless to say, if one of the most stable - the S&P 500 - in mid-March showed such a downward flight, which has not happened since October 1987 - the so-called ""Black Monday"". Having succumbed to panic that things will only get worse, investors began to sell shares much cheaper than they bought, thus going into a significant negative. But then these same stocks began to rise, sometimes even more rapidly than they fell.
2020 showed that in any situation it is important to be guided, on the one hand, by experience and knowledge, and, on the other, by flexibility and intuition. An experienced investor always has a plan, assesses risks, can stop on time, and react quickly. He can reasonably assess his portfolio - how many risks he currently bears and how to diversify them.
After such experiences and conclusions from last year, 2021 will push many to wake up and see things differently. And this applies to both the stock market and many other economic processes.

Naftogaz CEO: We must not start Naftogaz IPO with Ukrnafta,https://en.interfax.com.ua//news/interview/702826.html,"

Exclusive interview of Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev to Interfax Ukraine news agency
 
Criticism of the company has significantly increased recently. How fair and unbiased are the allegations directed at Naftogaz?
People are well aware of how the company is being transformed. Naftogaz has become the biggest contributor to the state budget, generating huge revenue and supporting the national economy, which is quite obvious when you look at the figures. Prior to corporate governance reform, the company used to be a black hole in the state budget with UAH 85 billion of net losses in 2014. In contrast, Naftogaz Group paid more than UAH 121 billion to the state budget in taxes and dividends in 2019. Despite the fact that the entire industry is currently going through challenging, we are not asking the government for financial support. We are cash-positive, for the time being at least. I fully believe we will remain so. We have a clear growth perspective ahead of us.
The company also makes every effort to continue its transformation internally, becoming more efficient and reliable while continuing to grow. For instance, we are improving our procurement system once more. This process is expected to not only save 10%-15% of our working capital, but also to accelerate our internal logistics. We are developing new businesses, change our operating model, improving communications, and introducing new technologies. This is a complex process, but we understand that we won’t be able to move forward without it.
Nevertheless, the attacks on Naftogaz continue. I think that one of the main reasons for this is the fact that the company is becoming more and more insulated against political influence due to Naftogaz’s corporate governance system, which has proved highly effective. This effectiveness is most immediately evident in recent achievements including successful unbundling, victory in Stockholm, and the new transit deal with Gazprom secured in late 2019. All of these successes were the direct or indirect results of corporate governance reforms, which enable the company to make rational decisions to the benefit of the company and, ultimately, in the interests of the shareholder, which is the state of Ukraine.
Before 2014, attitudes had been different. Naftogaz acted in the interests of a small group of individuals. The company became a black hole whose burden of losses was then shifted to the state budget. In other words, all Ukrainians were expected to shoulder the burden.
We should keep in mind that the people who used to benefit from Naftogaz have not disappeared. They are in parliament and on TV channels. They have access to considerable media resources and enjoy the support of various interest groups, including Russia. This explains why they never miss at opportunity to attack Naftogaz. Our opponents are opportunists. They try anything to undermine the reforms underway at Naftogaz and are always ready to explore new options.
Why is now a good time to attack? 
We are seeing shifts in the Ukrainian political landscape. Earlier, attacks against Naftogaz were coordinated by a single group within government. Now there is evidence of several political forces gaining more weight. New alliances are arising to defend well-established patterns of corruption and political influence.
The first incident was the state audit report, which was leaked and shared with the media. Then, on the day of Naftogaz’s Eurobond issue, a misleading and inaccurate statement was released by the head of the tax office. The tax office claimed to have identified problems at Naftogaz and said they would be imposing a fine. This was a clear attempt to scare off investors. The following day, tax officials came to our offices and requested tax payments.
This not a coincidence. I believe it was coordinated. Our opponents saw a chance in the shape of a power vacuum in central government, so they began attacking us. Even if these attacks do not harm us, they can be used as negotiating tools by the perpetrators. Our attackers go to their sponsors and say, “Well, we have attacked Naftogaz and created a toxic environment. Now we want something in return.”
We now have a situation where, on the one hand, they say to us, “Yes, we understand that it’s nonsense and all allegations are conjured up out of thin air and you need to fight.” But on the other hand, they say, “You are a black sheep. Your corporate governance is an eyesore to everyone, it annoys everybody. No political influence on the company, Naftogaz has it’s own point of view, are you kidding?” We reply that this very point of view generates more than UAH 100 billion annually for the state budget and it has its price. And they say, “Well, yes, it has. But nevertheless, we have our own preferences.""
Another problem is that people who don’t really understand the principles of corporate governance fail to see the connection. Shareholders stand to benefit from offering reasonable freedom and power to make decisions. It is extremely unhelpful when management officials regularly go to the shareholder and ask, “What shall we do? Are we allowed to do this or that?” The most recent example is our financial plan, when we asked for permission to invest at the level of parent company. The plan was not approved and we as a separate legal entity cannot invest in the development of fields for exploration and gas production. The government then takes these fields away from us because we don’t invest. Even when we ask whether we are allowed or not, we often receive no answer. When the authorities block licenses and refuse to grant access to new fields, we do not have opportunities to work. As a result, our shareholder loses. 
Were recent attacks followed by any proposals concerning appointments within the company, amendments to corporate governance policy, or compromises on the retail gas market? 
I have not seen any proposals of this kind so far.
Is the pressure on the company coming from internal or external actors? 
If we look at the media that supported the campaign against Naftogaz, I think it’s a combination of both.
The major problem for Naftogaz arising from the current situation was the cancellation of the planned Eurobond issue. How painful will this postponement be for the company?
We’ll know later. It’s too early to discuss it now. We have a clear understanding of the negative trends on the global market, but the situation in Ukraine is not yet clear. It will be possible to give a detailed and fact-based answer in some time.
How serious is the fact that you failed to exchange bonds maturing in 2022 in terms of liquidity?
We are a liquid company now. We believe that the problem of the canceled bond issue is solvable, and we will manage it successfully.
If everything quietens down, when should we expect the bond issue? Could it be in spring 2021 when a COVID vaccine may appear and energy prices may go up? 
I can’t comment on this.
How plausible is speculation that the audit report is part of efforts to create a negative image of the Ukrainian state in the eyes of the country’s Western partners?
What do you mean? Are you saying that everything produced by the Ukrainian state cannot be trusted and should be thrown in the garbage without hesitation?
Figuratively speaking, yes.
The most interesting and striking thing in this report is that the state auditors believe Naftogaz was not eligible to make provision for doubtful debts. This is very important to Western partners because the government, as the sole shareholder, believes that allowing or prohibiting this provision is at their discretion. This means that the government may assume the right to distort the financial statements of state-owned assets. This is unacceptable. Any state, government, or government agency that believes it can manipulate financial statements will just lose everyone’s confidence, including creditors and investors.
Bad debts are not at the shareholder’s discretion. It is the management’s duty to make the necessary provisions, regardless of the shareholder’s desire, otherwise confidence will be lost. No one will want to deal with a shareholder like that or their companies, especially with regard to funding.
Could this attack by the state audit service be a case of simple incompetence?
I talked to some of the people behind the audit and I wouldn’t say that they are absolutely incompetent. My impression was far from that. Let’s start with the fact that this audit story had been discussed earlier and the first figures were announced by well-known politicians. You can track that in the media. That is why I see a clear political imprint here. According to my sources, there were attempts to exert pressure on the auditors. I think you should ask them who they were discussing the report with, who saw it prior to publication, and who contributed to making this report. Those are very interesting questions that deserve scrutiny.
Do you see any connection between elections in Ukraine and the US?
I don’t see any connection. In the context of the US presidential election, the audit of Naftogaz would not be considered of interest.
One last question on this topic. Is there any effective response to this situation or any investigation?
Yes, we have received some documents saying, “Naftogaz management was acting to the benefit of foreign states and agents during the military aggression in the east of the country.” This wording refers to article 111 of the Criminal Code, which is high treason. They say, “Don’t worry, it’s just a formal investigation, no charges against you.” Well, thank you for these reassurances, but when you mention Naftogaz management, I’m definitely included. I was once fined UAH 8.3 billion, but I don’t remember any high treason cases. It’s a new stage in my career.
Will Naftogaz Group be loss generating in 2020?
I cannot say yet.
 
Ukrgasvydobuvannya forecasts a production decrease in Q4, and there are pending PSO debts. If you take these difficulties into account, Naftogaz Group is unlikely to improve on the losses incurred during the first six months of the year.
Ukrgasvydobuvannya did not generate losses in the first six months. This is important. The problems of the first six months lie in traditional in gas sales, particularly to those customers who received gas under the PSO system and did not pay. Nor do they appear ready to pay. This causes major losses.
As for production and accumulated stocks, we see some rebound in gas prices. We assume that the lion’s share of gas will be sold at a profit during the winter season. If we manage to monetize that gas and receive money for it, Naftogaz’s financial position will be stable. This position will not be extremely good, as heat producers and their collection rates are likely to cause some problems.
As for households and gas retail companies, we are offering our gas to all gas retail companies, but there is one condition they are still unwilling to accept. They must offer either advance payment or payment guarantees. Then they can buy gas at the market price.
Gas retail companies have a huge customer database. We understand that a significant share of this customer database is passive and will not leave their current providers quickly. We also understand that those customers are disciplined payers. The collection rate is close to 100%. Why gas retail companies think that they can collect 100% from households and pay us nothing is a complete mystery for us. We believe it’s not right and we will stand our ground. 
By the way, there is a draft law in parliament suggesting the creation of an auction committee to set the price of gas produced by Naftogaz Group. This repeats the approach to Ukrnafta sale prices. It is a pure copy of the existing scheme whereby a group of officials I’ve never seen before decides the price Ukrnafta will sell its oil. They want to project this onto Naftogaz. They are likely to determine payment conditions too, and we’ll get yet another PSO scenario. There will be a group of companies, which will take gas without payment or pay a minimum price for it, and then they will do whatever they want with that gas.
All the talk about the accessibility of Ukrgasvydobuvannya gas is nonsense. They don’t only need access to Ukrgasvydobuvannya gas, they need access to gas they can avoid paying for. We should call things by their proper names.
By the way, a recent meeting with the prime minister was attended by a large group of private producers who won a competition for production sharing agreements (PSA). They discussed a very interesting question. The government would like to get money instead of gas within PSAs, which is quite reasonable. But all the participating companies refused because there is a risk in our gas market that you may fail to collect money for the sold gas and hence fail to pay the state. This will lead to allegations of stealing gas and under-pricing. Everybody said, “We don’t want it. Take the gas.”
When somebody says producers can sell their gas easily, the market doesn’t support such claims. Selling gas in Ukraine is a complex process related to risks and the ineffective market.
I would like to reiterate that the payment issue was the major cause of Naftogaz’s losses in the first six months of 2020. It’s not about gas price reduction, which we were not obliged to implement, and we were right when we didn’t do it. It’s about UAH 1 billion that was related to price reduction for gas we are to sell in the near future. The price remains the same as it was on the balance sheets. The price has rebounded now. So, most of losses are related to the provision for doubtful debts. I wonder if someone at the State Audit Service heard something about where gas retail companies could spend this money. Naftogaz did not receive UAH 11 billion from companies we were obliged to sell our gas to under PSO. Perhaps it makes sense to hold a state audit of those companies.
Gas retail companies are not state-owned enterprises. This must be a case for law enforcement agencies.
But we don’t see any results. Moreover, the state audit report contains the old reproach from the tax office: why didn’t Naftogaz record all gas sales to its own account and why didn’t the company give nominations to a number of heat producers with substantial debts? What would happen if we followed this logic? We would acknowledge the sales at the PSO price, then calculate VAT and income tax. We didn’t sell. This means that those gas users without nominations were balanced by Ukrtransgaz where gas prices are higher. In other words, they used gas from Naftogaz, but at a higher price. What are the implications for the tax office? More VAT and income tax. What is the tax office saying? It’s wrong. Well, the tax office says the chosen transaction bringing more revenue to the state budget is wrong, and the budget doesn’t need additional revenue.
This story began back in 2016. I am well aware who inspired it. We were managing it for a long time and won the case at the Supreme Court. Now the state audit report says, “Well, we have revised this opinion of the tax office and decided that you were wrong and caused losses to the state budget.”
Do you see any litigation prospects in terms of enforcing gas retailer debts?  
Unfortunately, gas retail companies are dummies. I wouldn’t be surprised if they didn’t even have furniture on the books. Something happened there, and even those guys from the Energy Community Secretariat, who were telling us about unbundling for so long, are not commenting on it. If Naftogaz held a full- fledged unbundling, gas retail companies were not really unbundled from regional gas companies. They have the same shareholder. It’s not only about the Firtash group. It’s about all regional gas companies. Each regional gas company has its own gas retail company, both being owned by the same shareholder. Our opponents say, “But you have the same story with Kirovohradgaz.” Ok, let’s unbundle together. We are ready. We will leave the retail company, it’s our business, and sell the Kirovohrad regional gas company to someone else.
The question is how a “Plunder and Flee” company was granted a right to sell together with a customer database and so forth. The answer is because gas retailers are part of regional gas companies, otherwise they would never have managed that.
With the cancelation of PSO, Naftogaz has not been obliged to sell gas to gas retail companies for household customers at low prices since 1 August. Can we state with confidence that this will have a positive effect on financial statements in Q4 and beyond?
Only if they don’t vote for another legislative absurdity obliging us to do that again. I’ve already mentioned that there is a draft law of that sort in parliament. For now, we are not expecting any growth in retailer debts.
And what about heat producers?
This will depend heavily on the regulation of heat producer–gas supplier relations to be adopted by parliament. I believe the time has come when we cannot backslide. This season, we should adopt a law on powers and responsibilities regarding the management of heat producers. Currently, municipal heat producers, except for state-owned CHPs, are ruled by local authorities. There should also be consolidated responsibility.
Such as guarantees from the local authorities?
There are many mechanisms. It is important to implement the principle of balance between responsibility and power. If a city mayor wants to manage a heat generating enterprise, he or she should also bear responsibility for it. If a heat producer does not pay, then the city must pay for it. Mayors were happy to engage in self-promotion in October, talking about how they were good guys who provided heating to local communities. That’s fine, but please be responsible in terms of payment for the supplied gas.
The only people I hear talking about the introduction of payment discipline for municipal heat producers at the expense of local budgets are Naftogaz sources. Does anyone among the current crop of MPs or ministers support this initiative?
We have discussed it with many MPs. They understand us and typically answer, “We need to find a window of opportunity when it would be realistic to do this politically.” I cannot predict when this window of opportunity will appear. It is important to understand that they can no longer use us financially. We don’t have sufficient funds to sponsor heat producers as we did before, as we have lost gas transmission and transit revenues.
If a city doesn’t want to assume responsibility or cannot do so due to lack of funding, is Naftogaz ready to take control over the relevant heat producers? 
If a heat producer is municipal property, no way. The only case where we are ready to lenc a hand to the government is via state-owned CHPs.
Taking control over state-owned CHPs, as I understand, is to the benefit of Naftogaz, as the company will be able to make sure that the money is not being siphoned off?
During the last heating season, state-owned CHPs owed us nearly UAH 1 billion. Where is the money? I think that CHPs and the State Property Fund should explain this to auditors and law enforcement agencies. We would like to know the answer, too, but we care more about the UAH 1 billion we did not receive. This is a large amount. All this goes towards the provision for doubtful debts. Even MPs say in their explanatory note to draft law No3800-1 that there is no source for repaying those debts to Naftogaz. When our auditors read this, what provision do you think they will set for us? 100%, of course, if there is no source for repayment.
We say to the government, “If you have any other trustworthy company which could manage those CHPs effectively, start paying us 100% and repaying old debts later. We will gladly support this approach. Hugs and kisses. But it shouldn’t be a company like the one which managed CHPs in Novyi Rozdil and Novoyavorivsk before us.
We at Naftogaz have a rational attitude toward the insufficiency of the market. For instance, when we began our saga of production increases in 2015, there were no proper rigs for drilling deep wells. We had to buy them. If there had been a market, we would have rented them instead of buying. But there was no market. For instance, the market of fracking services exists, and we do not buy fracking equipment. If the market exists, we work with the market.
The same is true for CHPs. If there was a company capable of managing them better than we do, give them to that company. We will be happy about that. I have enough work to do. Heat producers are the last thing Naftogaz should be worrying about. But when the management every now and then says they don’t have money to pay, we have no choice but to offer our help in order to ensure full payment for gas.
How realistic is the privatization of state-owned CHPs?
I think it is currently impossible. The reason is simple. The CHPs in question owe us UAH 1 billion. Who would buy CHPs with a UAH 1 billion debt? We cannot waive the debt. The state auditor is very clear about that. Furthermore, we have to charge fines and penalties. Look at the huge debts generated, for example, by the Kryvyi Rih CHP. Any reasonable investor will ask, “Do I need this?”
The State Property Fund says there are some investors that are ready to enter the market. They even mentioned PGNiG.
I called PGNiG and asked them about this, just for fun. We have long-term business relations with them. They inquired what we were smoking and asked us not to make fun of them.
OK. What is the progress in negotiations between the State Property Fund and Naftogaz concerning state-owned CHPs?
At a recent meeting, the prime minister asked for clarity on what we plan to do with CHPs. During the video conference, State Property Fund head Dmytro Sennychenko said, and this was recorded in the minutes of the meeting,  that six state-owned CHPs were fully prepared for the heating season and would be launched in time, everything was OK, and no gas debts. However, I had a different table saying that debts do exist. They promised to repay those debts. As far as I know, there are some discrepancies between the reality and the statement. The situation is not as good as they presented it to be.
Naftogaz’s position is as simple as that. If everything is OK and the collection rate is 90%, or ideally 100%, then we have no questions. We deliver gas, you deliver heat. If you think that the eyes of Naftogaz managers are shining with joy when they are told to take control over CHPs, you are mistaken. But if the government wants to hand those CHPs over to us, we’ll take them. We saw a remarkable thing in Novyi Rozdil and Novoyavorivsk. What was the previous management doing? They used excessive amounts of gas and discharged heat in atmosphere. They did not collect money for heat supplies but sold electricity as much as possible. That was their business model. That is why they are up to their ears in debt, having failed to pay UAH 3.4 billion for gas.
We believe that if a decent management team, who will not steal and will use their brains properly, takes over the running of state-owned CHPs, losses will definitely decrease. Then we can discuss changes to the tariff policy, modernization, or the launch of some satellite businesses like balancing capacity.
To do all that, it’s not enough to just give us control over CHPs. If we know that the facility may be taken away from us, we will not invest in it. We need ownership, then we will invest in CHPs. There are no alternatives if no one can buy them with their huge debts. We understand the situation and are ready to help as partners.
Continuing on the subject of CHPs, does the company really have business plans to develop flexible gas generation based on CHPs?
This plan is being discussed with the government. There are some questionable aspects, however. How much is the market ready to pay for this service? What would be the cost of reserved capacity? We are looking at the green energy business and we have concerns regarding possible claims. Calculations look quite good, but what are the guarantees behind those figures? That is the question.
We understand that sooner or later, Ukraine will have to use flexible gas capacity. Gas is cleaner and faster that coal. The question is whether the market is ready to pay for it. Please explain to us how we will compensate all our costs and earn some margin. We don’t want to hear “it-is-too-expensive” feedback at a later date.
Should we expect PSO to be lifted in the heat supply market next year?
We hope this will happen. This is one of the reasons why we are so open to the option of handing the six state-owned CHPs over to us. Our concern is that they will not give us those CHPs, and investors will not arrive, which will prevent PSO cancellation in heat generation. They are the biggest problem in the heat supply market. If those six CHPs solve their problems, this will remove 80-90% of all problems in the market. Moreover, this would demonstrate that the problems in the heat supply market are solvable.
As a company, we are grateful to the government for solving the PSO issue in the household segment. The government solved it very rationally and courageously. As we see now, the solution was right: no cut-offs of gas supply, the system is functioning, and the market is functioning. They are telling stories that the opening of the gas market for households will cause gas cut-offs, everyone will freeze and die, but this is nonsense. Donetsk region had to use the supplier of last resort. We managed it. The last resort supplier works. We hope that the practice of constructive partnership will continue, as the current economic conditions do not let us live the high life and give away gas for free.
Let’s return to relations with the State property Fund. Given the growth in gas prices, is Naftogaz still interested in concluding a tolling contract with Odesa Port Plant?
Yes, we are interested and ready for cooperation. But we would like to participate in a contest for a long-term contract. They often ask us, “Hey guys, please come and work here,” when the situation is tough, but when it gets better, they say, “Goodbye, Naftogaz. We have another company.”
What term would be acceptable to Naftogaz? 
I think at least a one-year contract would be interesting.
Is it because the company has substantial gas stocks now and it has to do something with them?
No. We believe that the state has failed to generate much profit in this business. We could earn more there and pay more dividends to the state while the Odesa Port Plant could repay its debt to us, which exceeds UAH 2.2 billion.
Does Naftogaz see new business opportunities arising from the opening of markets? For instance, fuel station operators entered the agricultural segment, fertilizers, and retail. As you have capacity, you can deliver additional services.
I believe that retail is a great challenge for us. Naftogaz’s presence in the retail segment was previously insignificant. For our team it means building a new business unit based on new operating principles and rules. This business cannot operate within Naftogaz’s old corporate culture. We are implementing a number of projects now. For instance, we are creating our brand in this segment. For us, as a big producer and former gas transporter who have never operated in the retail segment, it is a tectonic shift in people’s minds to start doing it now.
We must build a customer database. Customers should regard Naftogaz as a company that delivers value. They should choose us consciously. Most gas retail companies just inherited their customers from regional gas companies. It was not an informed consumer choice. As a new player on the market, we must involve customers. To do that, we need to demonstrate the value we can deliver. If we manage to prove that we can deliver more value for our customers than other companies, then we will be able to extend these relations in many ways. That is why we regard relations with end customers as one of keys to our business.
We have achieved some progress, but we cannot say that development is fast. We are operating online so far. Our joint project with Privat24 has been launched recently. It was a long path to reach this point. We hope that another big state-owned bank will start to cooperate with us soon. We have started to work with PUMB bank and received an offline network as well. We don’t want to build our own network as it doesn’t make sense.
When the two-month period of services delivered as the last resort supplier expires, will Naftogaz be able to maintain at least 50% of customers in Donetsk region?
We aim to involve as many customers as possible. What will be the share? I wouldn’t like to make any forward-looking statements. It’s a kind of experiment. The implementation is not smooth. When it is over, I’ll comment on it. But it’s a challenge. Especially in Donetsk region.
Product Sharing Agreements. You’ve mentioned your meeting with the prime minister. Have you managed to achieve a compromise on signing agreements as soon as possible?
PSAs had been discussed even before our meeting at the level of inter-agency groups. Fourteen months have passed, and the PSAs are still not signed. We hope that the prime minister will be able to help us get the ball rolling where the inter-agency commission failed. The major problem with those agreements now is to ensure a balance of interests at the highest level. A sole representative of any of the involved agencies cannot do that.
For instance, the tax office wants more taxes, geologists want to explore more, investors also want to receive more. Striking the right balance is a question that must be decided at the highest political level. I think that the inter-agency commission is unable to do that without the prime minister and the ministers saying, “OK. The balance of interests shall be the following. We give this and we want to receive that in exchange.” And then they should go through everything, point by point. Rotations and changes at the ministerial level have had a negative impact on the process. As a result, there has been no consistent decision-making center. I hope this consistency will appear eventually, and we will be able to sign the necessary agreements.
We had a constructive meeting with the PM. Investors, the government, and Naftogaz officials shared their views and understood each other. I hope this path will lead us to success. Let’s try to achieve it together.
Has the government acknowledged that the previous scheme of approval through the inter-agency commission cannot be effective under the current conditions? 
That’s not quite right. There is another problem. The competition itself contained a number of issues. We warned that the competition model would be troublesome. It would be difficult to sign an agreement based on a competition like that. These assumptions proved to be true. I don’t want to comment on the contest itself. I believe everything that happened back in July 2019 will be revealed sooner or later.
We should now try to use the legacy of that competition to sign a proper agreement ensuring the right balance between the interests of the state and private companies. It’s a very challenging task. Senior government officials need to set the rules for this balance of interests now.
I’ve given you an example. We need to decide on payment. Shall the companies pay with gas or with money? No one in the commission has the authority to decide how. They cannot agree. They say, “Let’s leave two options.”
But two options are the worst-case scenario where we will need to build two systems: one for gas sales and the other for control over gas sales. It shouldn’t be that way. If I were the government, I would want to receive money too, as it means revenue to the state budget. I understand that. But the gas market with its current problems is not completed yet. Considering the GTS Code and other problems, it’s not easy to sell gas. Furthermore, a conflict of interest naturally arises. When a producer sells its own gas, which is the government’s share and whose gas should be sold first? Which customer will it choose for its own gas, and which for the government’s gas? I think the answer is obvious. Each party will pursue its own interests.
All these things need to be resolved. We can then move forward. The government’s intervention was the right step, as there are just two months left. During this period, we need to decide on the principles and the text of the agreement, and then we must sign it.
What about Yuzivka? Is Naftogaz Group interested in this PSA? Is it ready to develop this field on its own or with a partner? 
We are ready to start drilling on our own. If this field is given to us, we will be able to start drilling within six months of signing all the relevant documents.
The conditions of this PSA that were signed with Shell or Slovak Nafta cannot be signed again this time with Naftogaz. Am I right?
I cannot answer this question as we haven’t seen the documents. On 22 October, the responsible agency asked the government for permission to give us the copies. I cannot comment on things I haven’t seen. I hope everything is as they told us.
The story promoted by a well-known group of people under the name Yuzgaz was stillborn from the very beginning. We told them about it, we told everyone about it. You cannot just get assets through a doubtful competition and then resell them. First, they will become toxic, and respectable companies will never buy them. Second, you are unlikely to complete the project. And that was the case. We would like to recall some key facts. Within that field, there happened to be a licensed area of Naftogaz. We happened to drill in that area. Arguably, we are the most competent and transparent operator for the development of the entire field. We had started drilling long before all those events. Fracking, seismic studies by Schlumberger, interpretation and understanding of the new model. There were completed wells there. Finally, we got answers to all of our questions. The idea was to let Naftogaz begin work in order to understand what was there and then give to the entire field to Yuzgaz for free. Of course, I understand that Ukraine is a kind of Wild West in many ways, but not to that extent.
Yuzivka is a very interesting field to test the concept of tight sandstone. Confirming this concept is a big issue for us. We have a working assumption that needs to be checked. Our geologists will say if it’s right or wrong soon.
By the way, many people who worked on this project for Shell continue to do so with Ukrgasvydobuvannya. We hired not only professionals but those who know the site well. We were preparing to develop tight sandstone and we are ready to test this assumption. If the test is successful, I think we will be able to develop the field either on our own or in partnership, if we receive an interesting commercial offer.
Let’s proceed to international litigation. I understand that coronavirus disruption has delayed the decision on Ukrnafta in London?
If you are asking about the dispute with Ukrnafta minority shareholders, there’s nothing interesting or new besides the impact of COVID-19.
As for the case regarding Crimean assets, we have submitted all the relevant materials and are waiting for the tribunal’s decision on whether there will be a hearing or not. 
As for other interesting cases, we have signed a settlement agreement with Karpatygaz.
Have you paid? 
No. We are waiting the enforcement of the agreement in the Ukrainian courts. We need to pass certain proceedings here and receive all evidence.
Can’t you pay without it?
We can. But state auditors will say it’s not correct. They will definitely say it’s not right, though the Ukrainian court says it’s OK.
Now on to Ukrnafta. If will follow if parliament adopts the draft law on payment settlement? 
Nothing has changed here. We will suggest the next step, which is the division of the company.
Under what terms?
The terms will to some extent depend on debt repayment. Perhaps there will be a decision in the arbitration process between the state and minority shareholders by the end of the year. A combination of these two will enable us to negotiate with minority shareholders on what to do next. It doesn’t make sense to hold these negotiations now, as minority shareholders ask only one question, “When are you going to make the first step?” We must therefore make the first step and then we will enter into negotiations and will be able to comment on the terms. We have some ideas, but it wouldn’t be reasonable to put our cards on the table before negotiations begin.
How realistic is the division of licenses from the legal point of view? 
We are working on the legal mechanism. It’s unconventional. You are right to be somewhat skeptical as the licenses were granted to legal entities and so cannot be transferred together with assets. If the assets are divided, we will need to go to the government and ask them to reissue the licenses. The government, however, may say, “No, we want a competition because we want fair and transparent competition everywhere.”
We understand this, but, unfortunately, there are no easy solutions. We will need to look for ways out and suggest them. We have currently established a good dialogue with the state, I believe. It is more constructive in terms of relations with the government: we fulfill some tasks, they give us more and support us. We also hope for a constructive and pragmatic dialogue on this issue. The state has its interests and minority shareholders have their interests. We need to find the right balance and get things done. The problem needs to be solved. At Naftogaz, we want to have an integrated group without toxic elements in order to launch an IPO. It is impossible to do that with Ukrnafta. No way. Frankly speaking, I wouldn’t dare to try selling that to investors. That is why we need to complete the division and move forward.
Which of Ukrnafta’s assets are interesting to Naftogaz in the context of the division? What about the network of fuel stations which is big but not performing well?
The answer is in your question.
I see.
The network of fuel stations as a business is questionable now. CNG (methane) is far more attractive to us.
Has Gazprom ordered additional capacity for November? 
That is confidential information.
The last question is about the ownership policy for Naftogaz approved by the Cabinet and the strategy. They gave you three months. 
I think we’ll keep within the schedule. The strategy is almost ready.

Brent near $80 amid “supply” concerns,https://www.aljarida.com/articles/1632757382053976300/, 13-10-2022  ,2022-10-13,"Oil prices rose yesterday morning, for the fifth consecutive day, and Brent reached its highest level since October 2018, and is heading towards $80 a barrel, amid concerns about supply, at a time when demand is increasing in some regions of the world with the easing of measures to combat the Corona pandemic. Brent crude rose $1.15, or 1.5 percent, to $79.24 a barrel, after it recorded its third consecutive weekly increase last week. US crude rose $1.07, or 1.5 percent, to $75.05 a barrel, which is near its highest price since July, after recording its fifth consecutive weekly increase last week. Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for the price of Brent crude by the end of the year by ten dollars to $ 90 a barrel due to the recovery of fuel demand at a faster than expected rate from the repercussions of the spread of the delta mutated from the Corona virus and the impact of Hurricane “Ida” on American production, which led to a decrease in global supplies. Goldman Sachs said: “We have long had a positive outlook for oil prices, but the deficit between supply and demand is currently larger than our expectations with global demand recovering from the impact of the delta shift faster than our previous unanimous expectations and with global supplies remaining at levels lower than our previous expectations.” The recovery in demand surprised the member countries of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, the group known as “OPEC +”, and they faced difficulties in raising production with the continued lack of investments and the postponement of maintenance work due to the pandemic.

25% decrease in Saudi Aramco's net profit in the first quarter,https://www.aljarida.com/articles/1589289936299863000/, 13-10-2022  ,2022-10-13,"Yesterday, Saudi Aramco announced a decrease in net profit in the first quarter of the year by 25%, which is less than analysts' estimates, but the quarterly cash dividend is in line with a payment plan of $75 billion to shareholders for the current year. Analysts expected that Aramco, whose shares were floated on the stock exchange last year, would keep dividends to minority shareholders, while reducing dividends to the Saudi government, whose financial conditions were affected by the drop in oil prices amid the Corona pandemic. Brent crude prices fell 65.6 percent in the first quarter, before OPEC + producers agreed to cut supplies by a record size of 9.7 million barrels per day, starting in May, to help raise prices and curb oversupply. Despite the decline in profits, the cash flows of the giant state oil company remain strong, compared to other major oil companies, which reflects the strength and robustness of its financial statements. Aramco shares rose 1.3 percent to 31.30 riyals, but it remains below the initial public offering price of $ 32. Net profit fell to 62.48 billion riyals ($16.64 billion) after zakat and tax in the quarter ended March 31, from 83.29 billion riyals a year ago, lower than analysts' estimates of a profit of $17.8 billion.
 The company said that it paid a total dividend of $13.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, and that it will pay a cash dividend of $18.75 billion for the first quarter of this year, in line with the company's plan to make basic payments of $75 billion for the full year 2020. Aramco said that the first quarter dividends are ""the highest among all listed companies in the world."" But Aramco has not made any announcement regarding the future of the dividend policy. Youssef Hosseini, an analyst at EFG Hermes, stated that there will be no change in the dividend policy in the first quarter, but he still expects to reduce the government's share, which is the largest shareholder, from the distributions. He continued, ""The government's share will be reduced in the second quarter, but there is some optimism if it renegotiates the SABIC deal, which may provide some cash flow."" Aramco said earlier that its planned acquisition of a 70 percent stake in SABIC was moving towards completion in the second quarter. Sources told Reuters this week that the $70 billion deal is likely to be restructured."
Half a billion dollars’s share of the “Investment Authority” in the Aramco IPO,https://www.aljarida.com/articles/1578925320746051600/, 13-10-2022  ,2022-10-13,"Informed sources revealed to Al-Jarida that the General Investment Authority invested about half a billion dollars in the Aramco IPO, based on the subscription price of 30 riyals per share. The sources indicated that the General Investment Authority, based on the feasibility study for investing in the Saudi oil giant, submitted a specific price offer at a price of 32 riyals and another quantity at the price of 30 riyals, and based on Aramco’s decision, the price level for the subscription was adopted at the price of 30 riyals. Accordingly, the value of the invested funds amounted to about half a billion dollars, especially that the method of subscribing to the offering will be according to the book bulding mechanism, which is a mechanism followed in most international offerings, through which the subscription price is determined by investors, and the quantity of shares to be subscribed.
 She added that Aramco's executive management recently met with the authority's officials in Kuwait, with the aim of persuading them to subscribe to the company's capital, as part of a series of meetings held with some international investors and some Kuwaiti investment authorities, where a comprehensive presentation was presented on the company's financial position, and the company's future plan to expand Investment patch in the oil sector. The sources indicated that the Authority’s investment in Aramco comes within the main role it plays to achieve a return on the long-term investment of the financial reserves that it was entrusted with managing on behalf of the government, using the highest international professional standards, in a manner that ensures providing an alternative source of revenue for oil revenues. It is keen to study the areas in which it intends to invest in an extensive study, and examines many financial, economic and regulatory factors and indicators, such as the size of the economy, economic growth rates, the ease of business index, the tax facilities granted, strategies for exiting from the market, commercial and regulatory agreements (if any) and other factors in their interest. The strategy. Saudi Aramco had announced the offering of 1.5 percent of its shares for public subscription, equivalent to 3 billion shares, with a maximum of 0.5 percent allotted to individuals, and set the price range for the subscription between 30 and 32 riyals."

On the second offer, the value of the invested funds amounted to about half a billion dollars.

            ",2022-10-13,"Brazilian fintech Nubank launched in 2013, headed by billionaire David Velez with assets valued at $ 5 billion. The company offers loans, account loans and insurance. It quickly conquered the Brazilian market by offering its services free of charge - unlike local traditional financial institutions, and then it entered other Latin American countries. Suffice it to say that several hundred thousand Colombians have already signed up to use its services, waiting for the official start of Nubank in their country. In eight years, fintech gained 40 million customers in the Americas, and Warren Buffet alone invested in the company over $ 500 million. For now, this company is valued at $ 30 billion. However, after going public, its value could rise to as much as $ 50 billion, making it the most valuable online bank in the world. By comparison, Nubank's biggest competitor, Swedish Klarna, is valued at $ 45.6 billion. According to experts, such a high valuation is just the beginning - the Latin American market still has untapped potential, and Nubank is getting ready for global expansion - now it plans to enter the Indian market and has invested at least $ 45 million in fintech Jupiter. Poles can also participate in the stock exchange debut in NYC via the website freedom24.com, i.e. through the online store of the Freedom Finance Europe holding, which is a subsidiary of the American holding company, whose activities are regulated by the strict American Securities Commission - so do not worry about the certainty and security of transactions . The company is valued at $ 4 billion on the market and employs 2,000 people in 10 countries. Over 340,000 have already used its services. Customers. INVEST IN NUBANK The investment itself is simple - you need to set up an account in the Freedom24 store and then enter the amount you want to spend on investments (minimum $ 2,000, for shares costing from 10 to 11 dollars) - subscriptions last until December 8. The store warns, however, that we may receive shares for less than the amount for which the order was placed. Freedom24 reminds you that due to the number of investors, it can only execute part of the brokerage order. This is perfectly normal, and it happens every time you go public. The allocation rate, depending on the IPO, is from 1%. Up to 70 percent Of course, the money for the shares that have not been purchased is returned to the clients' accounts. The store reminds that the allocation depends on the customer's assessment. It is influenced by the number of transactions, the liquidity of the securities portfolio, as well as whether buyers invested sums of a similar size in other IPOs. This means that if someone is just beginning to be interested in the action cinema during stock market debuts, he can count on a lower allocation than an experienced player with a long experience. An IPO is an ""Initial Public Offering"", ie a stock exchange debut during which the company's shares are mainly sold to institutional investors and - to a lesser extent - to individual players. During this process, the company ceases to be privately owned and becomes a public offering. An IPO is mainly used to raise new capital or profits from private shareholders who had invested in the company before it went public. After its debut, the shares of a given company are available on the open market on the selected trading floor. Although the process has many advantages, its preparation, which is usually the responsibility of investment banks (they must - for example - estimate the cost of shares in a public offering), is expensive - entering the trading floor requires meeting many requirements and paying additional costs. Details of the offer can be found in the prospectus, which is also prepared by the investment bank."

            ",2022-10-13,"1.023 billion shares of the Allegro e-commerce platform were traded on Monday. eu. The listing of the company's shares began at 9.15 am. Allegro is the largest company listed on the stock exchange; is the largest IPO in the history of the WSE. Over 36,000 Allegro has trusted individual investors. Jarosław Gowin, the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Development, Labor and Technology, who participated in the Allegro WSE debut ceremony, said that this debut ""is good news for all of us."" The website, which employs over 2,000 people, enters the Warsaw Stock Exchange. employees and which supports over 4 million sellers - said Gowin. He expressed the expectation that in the future Allegro will be a more open, virtual window to the world and will enable Polish companies to develop their business abroad. As he said, in recent months, ""in this difficult time for the Polish and world economy, the role of the e-commerce industry has definitely increased"". He noted that online shopping is a safe alternative in times of a pandemic. - No wonder that Allegro is still hiring new employees. As the minister of development, labor and technology and as the deputy prime minister of this government, I hope that you will employ even more people after you go public - he added. As he pointed out, Allegro also invests in new technologies. - I hope that after entering the stock exchange you will invest even more strongly and dynamically in this area - he said. According to Gowin, the development of e-commerce has a positive effect on many other industries, such as courier and electronic payments. Gowin thanked that Allegro was a partner of the government business project ""Move your business to the Internet. Earn money on e-commerce"", addressed to micro, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs with stationary stores. The Polish government is working on various initiatives to guarantee the digital single market. Fair and accessible also for small and medium-sized enterprises that want to use platforms such as Allegro. It is about providing entrepreneurs with the possibility to effectively pursue their rights. I invite representatives of the e-commerce industry to participate in consultations - he said. At the same time, he assured that ""we will not leave anyone and any industry on its own."" ""We will help those experiencing a worse period to bounce back quickly, and we will try to help those who are developing dynamically to make this development even more dynamic,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister. He recalled that in the first half of 2020, the Stock Exchange recorded record turnover on the stock market. ""It was PLN 131bn on the main trading floor, and PLN 4bn on NewConnect,"" he said. Allegro CEO Francois Nuyts declared that the company would continue to invest, hire new employees and develop the business. As he said, the pace of the company's development is something to be proud of and its management is constantly considering how to improve the business. There are so many things that can still be improved in the area of ​​our business and we are back to work on them - he said. Nuyts also said that he will not spread great visions of development now, he will limit himself to thanking him. As he emphasized, thanks are due, above all, 100 thousand. sellers operating on the platform and 12 million customers. He also thanked the company's employees and all external companies involved in the IPO. The total value of Allegro's public offering will be PLN 10.6 billion if the additional allocation option is fully exercised or PLN 9.2 billion without the additional allocation option. The public offering included the issue of 23,255,814 new shares, from which the company obtained gross proceeds of approximately PLN 1 billion, and the sale of 190,293,225 existing shares sold by the existing shareholders. The funds from the issue of new shares are to be used to repay the company's debt. Allegro's offer initially included a total of 216 million shares (including up to 15% of shares that will go to Morgan Stanley as an option stabilizing the price after the company's debut on the stock exchange). After the offer was raised, the total number of shares offered was 246,857,143, including the stabilization option. The shares in free float will account for 20.9 percent. (before exercising the additional allocation option). The remaining shares held by majority shareholders are covered by a lock-up agreement for 180 days from the first day of listing on the WSE. Under the Allegro offer, retail investors were allocated a total of 9,342,771 shares, and institutional investors a total of 236,238,624 shares (including additional allotment shares). The average reduction rate for buy orders placed by retail investors in the Allegro offer was approximately 84.85%. Allegro Group runs the largest trading platform in Poland, which is Allegro. pl, and the price comparison engine in Poland - Ceneo.pl and employs over 2,400 people. Allegro's profit in the first half of this year. increased year on year to PLN 289.7 million from PLN 195.7 million. Krzysztof Krawczyk, CEO Shoper Allegro's debut on the WSE will be more important for the financial market than for the e-commerce industry itself. Here, the relations between stores and marketplaces are already quite well organized, and investments in the sector should have a positive impact on the entire e-commerce industry in Poland. Allegro is also one of the sales channels for online stores. Allegro is a business partner for companies such as ours that provide solutions for online sales. We encourage online stores using our platform to sell wherever there are customers, including Allegro. Our software has been prepared so that it allows you to manage multiple sales channels, both your own store and the account on the auction site. At the beginning of 2020, we additionally strengthened our relations with Allegro, thanks to which online store owners can now use Allegro Ads advertising campaigns. We also noticed that Allegro sellers started to launch their own channel more often and integrate it with sales service in the marketplace to have everything in one place. Thanks to these movements, the number of stores with Allegro integration has increased by 39 percent since the beginning of the year. Paweł Szewczyk, Vice President of the Management Board of merce.com Allegro's debut is a local confirmation of what is happening on global stock exchanges. Companies related to e-commerce are starting to actively seek funds for further dynamic development. In August, the BigCommerce platform made its debut on the stock exchange overseas, and a few weeks ago, Wish marketplace announced similar plans. Investors look favorably at smaller (compared to Allegro and American giants) e-commerce companies, because they are able to ensure high rates of return. Although the property of Jeff Bezos attracts media attention the most, it is not Amazon that boasts the greatest increases on global stock exchanges, but local e-commerce companies that are smaller than it. An example of such a company can be the Swedish Boozt, German Home24 or the Polish SFD. All this should encourage more Polish players to enter the dance floor. Answear has already announced this. Against this background, Allegro's entry on the WSE is not so much a harbinger of a new era for online trading, but fits in with the current trend of investing in e-commerce businesses, which the Covid-19 pandemic is further exacerbated. A psychological factor may turn out to be significant, if, as expected, the Poznań website turns out to be the highest-valued company on the stock exchange and maintains this position longer, dethroning the current leader, CD Projekt. He may then follow in his footsteps as a popularizer of his industry in the collective imagination. It was similar with gaming, which, thanks to the stock exchange successes of the Warsaw studio, began to be perceived not only from the perspective of new technologies, but also in the business and investment context. Ewa Bartnik, Finance and HR Director of IMKER We are concerned that the date of Allegro's listing on the stock exchange is not without significance. The e-commerce giant Amazon is likely to start operating on the Polish market soon, and its presence will negatively affect the valuation of the Polish company. Today Allegro shares seem bargain, but it may very quickly turn out that entering the stock exchange was profitable only from the perspective of current investors."

Europe beats US on Chinese listings for first time,https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/europe-beats-us-on-chinese-listings-for-first-time/47896250?utm_campaign=teaser-in-channel&utm_medium=display&utm_source=swissinfoch&utm_content=o,2022-09-13T12:23:00+02:00,2022-10-13,"Chinese companies have raised more than five times as much money through share sales in Europe than the US this year, as exchanges in London and Zurich benefit from fraying geopolitical ties between the superpowers. The fundraising haul marks the first time that Chinese corporate dealmaking in Europe has exceeded that in New York. It underscores the high stakes of a landmark audit inspection agreement between Beijing and Washington, which will be tested this month as the fate of about 200 Chinese companies’ listings on Wall Street hangs in the balance. Five Chinese companies have raised more than $2.1 billion (CHF2.2 billion) on stock exchanges in Zurich and London this year, according to data from Dealogic. By comparison, less than $400 million in total has been raised from listings in New York. Zurich, in particular, has benefited from a new “stock connect” scheme with mainland Chinese exchanges and its less demanding requirements over the transparency of company audits. Chinese listings on Wall Street, which raised $12.4 billion in the first half of last year, were effectively shuttered in July 2021, when regulators in Beijing targeted ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing over cyber security breaches just days after its $4.4 billion initial public offering. By the time it delisted from the New York Stock Exchange 11 months later, Didi’s market value had fallen by about 80%. The incident further soured a long-running dispute over US regulators’ access to Chinese audit files, which could lead to Washington banning trading in all Chinese companies in 2024. Beijing has launched an overhaul of rules for Chinese companies listing overseas and cracked down on sectors from technology to education, adding to bearish sentiment among global investors. The regulatory escalation has also damped Chinese corporate fundraising in Hong Kong. IPOs in the Chinese territory are at their lowest level in two decades, with hundreds of companies given the green light to list in the city delaying or abandoning their plans. However, Hong Kong was still China’s largest offshore market with IPO fundraising totalling $6.6 billion this year, which is about 80% lower than a year ago. The rush of deals on European stock exchanges is a result of “Chinese regulators saying the US dialogue is ongoing, the Hong Kong market is small, so let’s look at the European market — London, Switzerland and Germany”, said a partner at an international law firm in China that had worked on Chinese IPOs in Europe this year. In July, exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen signed a deal for Chinese companies to carry out secondary listings on the SIX Swiss exchange via a “stock connect” scheme. Four Chinese companies have raised $1.5 billion since the scheme was launched. More 
While there is this deep-rooted tradition of respect of the environment in Switzerland it does not necessarily extend beyond the country's borders.  Chinese financial groups have also been expanding their footprint in Europe’s financial centres. In June, the UK arm of CICC, a state-run investment bank, became the first Chinese member of the Swiss exchange, and last month, the chief executive of Huatai Securities, China’s second-largest broker, said the company planned to obtain licences to run equity deals in Zurich and Frankfurt. There has been one new Chinese listing in London this year. The UK capital has a similar “connect” scheme with Shanghai and hosted a secondary share sale for Ming Yang Smart Energy in July that raised almost $660 million. Qingdao Haier, the electronics manufacturer, raised about $330 billion in Frankfurt in 2018. “Listings in Zurich and Frankfurt show Chinese issuers’ growing ability to access continental investors more directly,” said Jason Elder, partner at law firm Mayer Brown in Hong Kong. However, he cautioned that the European share sales were unlikely to rival the flow of dealmaking by Chinese groups in New York, which raised more than $100 billion from share sales on Wall Street over the past two decades. “I don’t see the stock connect deals in Europe as being in the same vein as what you get in the US,” said Elder. A person involved in setting up the stock connect scheme between China and Switzerland said the arrangement was attractive to Beijing because it did not force Chinese companies to make their audit files available to Swiss regulators, in contrast to regulatory standards in the US. Officials from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the US accounting regulator, will travel to Hong Kong in mid-September to examine the audit working files of several Chinese companies listed in New York, including Jack Ma’s Alibaba and Yum China, which owns the KFC and Pizza Hut brands in China.

Genome editing’s patent problem fuels concern for the future of food,https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/genome-editing-s-patent-problem-fuels-concern-for-the-future-of-food/47287668?utm_campaign=teaser-in-channel&utm_medium=display&utm_source=swissinfoch&utm_content=o,2022-01-31T09:00:00+01:00,2022-10-13,"Amid growing concern about whether a world battered by climate change will be able to produce enough food to feed the planet, genome editing has been touted as part of the solution in many countries including Switzerland. But an outdated patent system threatens to stifle its potential and put more power in the hands of big business. Jessica covers the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to big global companies and their impact in Switzerland and abroad. She’s always looking for a Swiss connection with her native San Francisco and will happily discuss why her hometown has produced some of the greatest innovations but can’t seem to solve its housing crisis.  My specialty is telling stories, and decoding what happens in Switzerland and the world from accumulated data and statistics. An expatriate in Switzerland for several years, I have also worked as a multimedia journalist for the Swiss national broadcaster.  For more than 10 years scientists at Switzerland-based Syngenta Group worked to develop a variety of disease-resistant cabbage that would thrive in hot, dry weather, and benefit the soil by requiring less nitrogen to grow. The basketball-sized vegetable was bred to grow close to the surface, making it easier for farmers to harvest. On display at the company’s annual showcase for its latest seed innovations last autumn, the “weather-proof” cabbage was joined by other new designer vegetables including “rust-resistant” green beans, snackable snow peas, and a “burger leaf” lettuce bred specially to stay crisp and fresh when squashed between a hot burger and a sandwich bun. But agriculture technology firms like Syngenta, now owned by Chinese state-owned company ChemChina, no longer see the need to spend years developing new vegetable varieties using conventional breeding methods that involve crossing two plants over multiple generations. They want to use technology like CRISPR-Cas9, a genome-editing tool that enables them to alter the DNA of vegetables and other crops, adding beneficial traits and removing undesirable ones, to get just the product they want. This could cut the time it takes to produce some new varieties by as much as 75%. More

What’s behind the science and the debate on genome-edited plants?  “Genome editing has a huge amount of potential for the future in terms of the seed products we can develop,” Charlie Baxter, Syngenta’s head of global seed traits and regulatory, told SWI swissinfo.ch. “We need to recognise that if we are going to feed a growing planet, and in a sustainable way, we are going to need to use new technologies.”   With an initial public offering (IPO) on the Shanghai stock exchange in preparation, the company is tight-lipped about its plans. However, a spokesperson told SWI it is investing in genome editing in countries including the US and China to change the nutritional content, increase yields, and improve resistance to pests and diseases across a variety of crops. With each new trait, Syngenta, and many other big seed companies, are amassing more patents, giving them the right to exclude anyone else from reproducing, using, selling, or distributing their invention. But this development is raising red flags among many plant breeding experts and farmers’ rights activists, who fear it will wreck the global seed market, shutting out small players and choking innovation. The introduction of tools like CRISPR-Cas9 into the food system is already a flashpoint in much of Europe as regulators consider how, if at all, it should be regulated. At the centre of the debate are the safety and environmental risks, and whether plants bred with genome-editing technologies should be classified as Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), whose cultivation has been banned or heavily restricted in agriculture in the European Union and SwitzerlandExternal link for nearly two decades. Up to now, Switzerland has followed EU regulators, classifying genome-edited seeds under GMO regulation. But views are shifting – a European Commission studyExternal link published in April 2021 proposed updating legislation to reflect advances in genomic techniques, and in December, one chamberExternal link of the Swiss parliament voted to exclude genome editing from the GMO ban. If the technology advances and more governments allow genome editing, 50% of new seed varieties on the global market will have at least one genome-edited trait in 20 years’ time, predicts Michael Kock, a patent attorney who spent nearly a decade as head of intellectual property at Syngenta. All seeds with these traits will be covered by at least one patent. Genome editing has already led to an exponential rise in the number of patents even though only two genome-edited food products – a soybean oil and a tomato – have been launched on the market. Kock estimates about half of all international plant patent filings in 2021 involved aspects of genome editing.   More Join the discussion Multinational companies Genome editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 are being tabled as a way to feed the planet. What do you think about the idea? According to IPStudies-Centredoc, a Switzerland-based patent analysis firm, there were 21 patent families (all patent filings in different countries for one invention) on plants using CRISPR in 2012. By 2021, this had reached 2,000. Within each patent family, there can be dozens of patents in various countries. While a majority are in China and the US, about 700 extend to other countries. This sea change has profound implications for the future of our food because it means that any new trait like drought resistance or leaf size can be patented provided the genetic change doesn’t already exist in nature. As genome editing allows for more precise changes to a plant’s genome, the number of new traits will surge. And it’s not only traits that can be patented. New breeding methods, genetic sequences and in some cases, products such as beer made with genome-edited barley, can be covered by patents. New plant varieties can also be covered by other forms of intellectual property protection (see box). Such protection should encourage research into new, more useful seeds by giving inventors ways to recoup their investment. Since the advent of GMOs and biotechnology in agriculture, patents are granted more oftenExternal link. Patent laws vary from country to country, but most allow some form of patent or plant variety protection. A seed or plant, as well as any natural object, plant and animal and biological process, is excluded from patent protection. However, a patent can be granted for traits, sequences, or methods if the genetic change doesn’t already exist in nature. Patents are awarded when the applicant can demonstrate it is novel, an inventive step, and has industrial application. A plant varietyExternal link, which is a precisely defined group of plants within the same species, can’t be patented but can be covered by a plant variety protection (PVP) certificate based on conventions from the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV). A certificate is granted when a variety is distinct, uniform, stable and new. There is an exemption for breeders to use the seed (without the consent of the PVP holder) to develop a new variety. Farmers can reuse seeds in some cases but can’t sell or exchange them without consent. It isn’t just the number of patents that is expected to increase. Plant breeding is a constant process of taking one seed and crossing it with another, so that the same germplasm gets passed on to the next generation of seeds. As genome editing speeds up innovation, patents will get stacked on top of each other and overlap more often. In an articleExternal link published late last year, Kock, who now works as an independent advisor to the seed industry, warned that this patent stacking could have a “chilling effect” on innovation. “If one seed is covered by 8-10 patents, it will be so difficult for breeders or farmers to negotiate royalties with all the different patent owners,” Kock told SWI. Breeders will need to secure multiple licenses to market their new variety, which gets complicated and expensive as breeders usually pay a percentage of sales to the patent owner. Some breeders will be reluctant to reuse seeds at all, even those developed through conventional methods, fearful they could unknowingly infringe on someone’s patent. Kock says some breeders already today don’t want to touch the genetics of certain seed companies. These concerns were echoed by the European Commission’s recent studyExternal link, which warned that patents and licensing associated with new genomic techniques can act as a “barrier to market entry” for small companies and limit access to new technologies and genetic material for further breeding. “We need to find a way to make innovation accessible without throwing away the incentive to create the next generation of innovation,"" says Kock. He argues that there needs to be a fundamental overhaul of the intellectual property system. Plant breeding has been practiced for thousands of years by farmers in search of products with desirable traits such as higher yields, resistance to disease, or improved flavour. Today, gardeners and farmers are still involved, but the industry is dominated by companies – Euroseeds, a Brussels-based industry association for the European seed sector, says it has more than 36 national member associations from EU member states and beyond who represent several thousand seed businesses. At the top of the pile are deep-pocketed multinationals such as Syngenta, US-based Corteva Inc. (formerly the agriculture division of DowDuPont), and Bayer AG which bought rival Monsanto in 2018. They are among the world’s 10 largest seed companies who, through mergers and acquisitionsExternal link, are estimated to controlExternal link at least 70% of the global market. Farmers’ rights campaigners and small breeders are increasingly concerned that the inevitable march toward patenting everything will concentrate the seed market even more in the hands of these big companies. “It's not only the technology itself that is a problem, but it's a problem of the power relations and the industrial agricultural system behind it,” says Simon Degelo from Swissaid, which has been campaigning for the rights of small-scale breeders and farmers in poorer countries. “Farmers should be allowed to [freely] choose the seeds they want and re-use them if they think that's best for them.” CRISPR-Cas9 was supposed to democratise innovation because it is cheaper and easier to manipulate genetics in plants. But all the intellectual property protections will shut others out of the market by making it more expensive and difficult for farmers and breeders to re-use seeds, argues Mariam Mayet, director of the African Centre for Biodiversity in Johannesburg, South Africa. “It’s more of the same but just more dangerous because you're now going into the genome of the plant,” says Mayet. This raises the prospect of more genetic material falling into the hands of private companies. Most of the foundational patents for CRISPR technology are owned by academic institutions and licensed out to companies and others to use. This concern is shared by Monika Messmer, a senior scientist at the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture in Switzerland. “When new cultivars [plants bred for certain traits] are released in Europe, breeders still can profit from the progress of others and the whole community improves due to the breeders' exemption of the plant variety protection. That is something highly threatened by patents because you aren’t allowed to take it to improve your own seeds.” She fears more money will flow into major crops like maize and soybean, and into traits like pesticide resistance where the prospects for profit are greatest. “We shouldn’t just be asking if this technology is safe and release it. We also need to ask what benefit it brings to society,” Messmer told SWI. She thinks companies should be required to share genetic material through gene banks for others to use.   Euroseeds told SWI that it encourages companies to license patented traits but that it’s an “individual business decision” what and how to license something. Syngenta’s Baxter says the company is open to sharing technology with others, and has already created a licensing platform for vegetables, which allows breeding companies and academic institutes to use the technology how they want. “Seed companies are successful because they know what they're doing, and they put a lot of expertise into developing new products,” says Baxter. “If they didn't work, people wouldn't buy our seed products. We are trying to do something good for the growers. The market is open to competition.” Edited by Nerys Avery Correction: please note that this story has been updated to clarify that most of the foundational patents for CRISPR technology are owned by academic institutions and licensed out to others to use.

State-owned ChemChina bought the Basel-based Swiss agriscience group Syngenta for $44 billion in 2017. ChemChina’s application to list on Shanghai’s STAR Market was accepted at the start of July and was widely expected to be the world’s largest flotation this year. The STAR market suspended 57 applications on September 30, citing a lack of updated financial information. Under bourse rules, applicants must provide additional information if financial materials in applications are outdated. ""The application review has been temporarily paused"",  ChemChina is also considering a secondary listing for Syngenta that could take place less than a year after its Shanghai debut, with exchanges in Zurich, London and New York among the options being examined, sources told Reuters. The takeover of Syngenta in 2017 and airline catering business Gategroup by Chinese companies in 2016 sparked a reaction by the Swiss authorities and new rules. In the future the takeover of Swiss companies by foreign state-owned or state-linked funds is to be better regulated. The government has laid down the broad outlines of a foreign investment control system. Concerned about the international trend of company takeovers, parliamentarians adopted a motion in March 2020 to protect the Swiss economy. More

Swiss crypto exchange aims for IPO,https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-crypto-exchange-aims-for-ipo/47013822,2021-10-08T17:17:00+02:00,2022-10-13,"Swiss crypto company Smart Valor has recently raised CHF3 million from investors as part of its plans for a public listing. When not covering fintech, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, banks and trade, swissinfo.ch's business correspondent can be found playing cricket on various grounds in Switzerland - including the frozen lake of St Moritz.   Co-founder and chair Olga Feldmeier told me the company is looking at a range of European exchanges on which to list, including Deutsche Börse and Swedish-based Nasdaq First North Growth Market. We will send you a bi-weekly exploration of financial technology innovations in Switzerland. Biweekly The SBC Privacy Policy provides additional information on how your data is processed.  I consent to the use of my data for the SWI swissinfo.ch newsletter. Nasdaq First North has hosted three crypto initial public offerings (IPOs) already this year: Coinshares, Safello and Xpecunia. All these listings were heavily over-subscribed at a time when the cryptocurrency market had witnessed spectacular price gains. In April, the US crypto exchange Coinbase caused a stir by raising $86 billion by listing on Nasdaq. Smart Valor has a more modest two-digit million target from its proposed IPO. Feldmeier is confident that Smart Valor has boosted its balance sheet enough with its latest funding round to pass muster at most exchanges. But she would not be drawn on the timing of an IPO. “The blockchain technology, as every other early-stage technology, currently still has a bit of mixed reputation,” she said. “As an authorised exchange and custodian we practice stringent corporate governance which helps to gain trust of our customers. As a bridge between the decentralised economy and consumers we are in the business of trust. This goes hand-in-hand with a public listing.” Other companies are also eager to escape the sometimes murky shadows of the cryptocurrency industry. Having failed to gain a Swiss banking license earlier this year, Bitcoin Suisse now says it wants to go public in the near future. Set up in canton Zug’s “Crypto valley” in 2017, Smart Valor is also eyeing up a distributed ledger technology (DLT) stock exchange license in Switzerland. “It’s a state-of-the-art license. No other country has created such an advanced regulatory framework for blockchain based exchanges today,” says Feldmeier. As I said in my last newsletter, it’s been all but impossible to set up a cryptocurrency exchange in Switzerland in the past without a banking license. Smart Valor, Lykke and Swissborg have all found it easier to operate elsewhere in Europe despite having Swiss HQs. Smart Valor runs its asset management business from Switzerland and currently operates exchange services from neighbouring Liechtenstein – where it is also applying for a license to issue digital securities. More widely known exchanges, like Binance and Bitfinex once tried their luck with the Swiss regulator but decided against the move. For a long time, this was a noticeable empty space for a country that markets itself as “Crypto Nation”. The new Swiss DLT exchange license, unveiled on August 1, now provides another option – with the added benefit of being able to trade digital securities to the general public. This might produce some competition for the SIX Digital Exchange, which was awarded a license to operate last month. I will explore the theme of how Switzerland plans to gentrify cryptocurrencies in an article on SWI Swissinfo.ch soon, so watch out for it. More

Swiss footwear company On is making a name for itself in an industry that has been dominated by big players like Nike. What makes it different?  The previous day, Sportradar started a new chapter in its history as a Nasdaq-listed company worth $8 billion. Both firms had good reasons to opt for an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. Sportradar is taking advantage of recently relaxed sports betting laws that pave the way for more US states to legalise the practice. The Swiss-based company says it aims to grab around a third of the rapidly expanding US market with its technology that processes sports data for the media and betting industries. “Ultimately, for any company, the decision of where to go public is a business decision rather than one related to patriotism,” Leti McManus, founder of consultancy firm Tiger Link Advisors, told SWI swissinfo.ch. This also applies to On Group, which leverages its Swiss quality label and the backing of Federer. The Zurich-headquartered company chose to list on the NYSE because the United States last year became the brand’s largest market with the highest growth in sales. “The US is the largest sportswear market in the world. A listing there offers a massive opportunity for publicity and media exposure, which means visibility amongst customers and investors,” said McManus. “The NYSE is home to other well-known sportswear brands, such a Nike and Adidas, so it’s no surprise that On wanted to list on the same platform as the big players.” On Group has seen sales almost triple in the last three years to CHF425.3 million in 2020. But these sums pale in comparison to industry market leaders Nike and Adidas, which dominate the $118.5 billion global sports shoe market. The sportswear industry as a whole suffered from the Covid-19 pandemic, which closed retail stores around the world, but market research firm Euromonitor expects the sports shoe market to pick up to reach around $180 billion by 2024. On appears to be following in the footsteps of Nike, which catapulted into the big league in 1984 by designing a basketball shoe endorsed by legendary player Michael Jordan (who is now, coincidentally, a backer of Sportradar). Federer became an On Group investor in 2019 and has helped design a tennis shoe bearing his name. Back in Switzerland, the main Swiss stock exchange has averaged just under five company listings per year between 2010 and 2020. Operator SIX Group aims to improve on this record by introducing a new share segment, called SparksExternal link, aimed at encouraging some of the country’s nearly 600,000 small and medium sized enterprisesExternal link (with less than 250 employees) to list their stock.

Switzerland Today,https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-today/46950778,2021-09-15T18:00:00+02:00,2022-10-13,"Greetings from Bern! The rumours are true: Roger Federer-backed shoe brand On running has gone public. The company, which says its shoes are akin to running on clouds, is on cloud nine after the Zurich company raised more than $700 million in its IPO. But the company’s executives say that they plan to keep their heads out of the clouds even as they are set to cash in. There’s other news back on the ground with the poll results out for the September vote and parliament’s autumn session. And, the Bernese football fans are reveling in their surprise victory after what the Guardian called “a night of humiliation” for Manchester United. Jessica covers the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to big global companies and their impact in Switzerland and abroad. She’s always looking for a Swiss connection with her native San Francisco and will happily discuss why her hometown has produced some of the greatest innovations but can’t seem to solve its housing crisis.   In the News: Poll shows solid support for same-sex marriage; but capital gains tax proposal set to fail. More Join the discussion Swiss Politics On September 26, Swiss citizens will vote on the so-called ""99% initiative"" that aims to tax capital gains more heavily.  Talk of the town: On Running has gone public; what’s next?    On Running has exceeded expectations for its IPO today, raising more money than originally planned. According to Bloomberg, its is about $7.3 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in filings. The 11-year-old Zurich firm doesn’t plan to let this go to their head. In an interview in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, the co-CEOs asserted that the company cultureExternal link will stay the same – focused on running and nature. Instead of going out to buy Porches and yachts today, the employees at On’s local offices apparently celebrated the IPO by climbing a mountain. For years, the company had a niche following among athletes and urban trendsetters but this changed when tennis star Roger Federer came on board as an investor and designer of his own shoe line. The company also outfitted the Swiss Summer Olympic Team, giving it visibility and catapulting it into the mainstream and as a viable competitor to the likes of Nike and Adidas. But the company has always said it wants to do things differently than the big footwear brands on the market. And a big part of that is using its “Swissness” – quality, innovation and design – to its advantage. Industry watchers are curious what the company will do next with the cash influx. One clue, say the CEOs, is the company plans to take on the Chinese market, opening 40-50 new outlets in the country in the “medium term”.  Deep Dive: What airports tell us about how countries see the future of the pandemic. For many of us that braved Covid restrictions and took an airplane in the past few months, soaring above the clouds never felt so exhilarating. But the starkly different travel experiences at airports in cities like Beijing, Zurich and London are a window into how different cultures deal with pandemic fears and how they view the future. Sam Jones from the Financial Times writes today about his own experience flying back and forth from Zurich to London. Where Zurich is calm and orderly, London is complex and costly as it copes with the UK’s ever-changing travel and border policies. In November, as the second wave of the pandemic gripped Europe, Zurich airport opened its gleaming new business conference centre, writes Jones. If Zurich airport is a “signal of Switzerland’s intent after the pandemic, it is one of openness and business as usual”. Switzerland and Britain are the two big European economies outside the European Union, and if they are serious about trading with the bloc, “it is their airports that count as the litmus test of how that is going”. But making your way through London airport still pales in comparison to the experience in China where authorities have gone to far-reaching extents to maintain its “no Covid” strategyExternal link. A journalist with the NZZ said his experience traveling to Qingdao, China felt sometimes “like you're on a mission to the moon”. The journey included seventeen coronavirus tests, three weeks in quarantine, one dead bat, and too many QR codes to count. What's your experience been like traveling?

UBS wealth business booms but are risks piling up?,https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/ubs-wealth-business-booms-but-are-risks-piling-up-/46942876?utm_campaign=teaser-in-channel&utm_medium=display&utm_source=swissinfoch&utm_content=o,2021-09-13T08:47:00+02:00,2022-10-13,"Soon after Iqbal Khan joined Credit Suisse in 2013 he was invited to dinner at Zurich’s elegant Ristorante Bindella for a discreet conversation with the chief financial officer of UBS, his new employer’s fierce rival. Khan had got to know Tom Naratil well over the previous two years while Khan was a partner at EY and lead auditor to Switzerland’s UBS. Over a chandelier-lit pasta meal, Naratil decided UBS would benefit from bringing the highly ambitious Khan onboard.  Now, two years after the ex-auditor finally joined his one-time client, Khan and Naratil are running UBS’s $3.6-trillion (CHF3.3 trillion) wealth business, the bank’s beating heart and its profits engine. “The fact that they didn’t end up in a situation where either got fired or they killed each other, that’s actually a pretty good relationship,” said a senior UBS executive. But with profits hitting record levels, the pair must now prove they can keep returns high while also managing the growing risks. As the world’s biggest wealth manager, UBS has had a stellar pandemic. Its ultra-wealthy clients have seen their assets soar on the back of the trillions central banks pumped into the global economy. Much of that injection has ended up in the financial markets, helping the total wealth of billionaires worldwide rise from $5 trillion to $13 trillion in the first 12 months of the pandemic. UBS’s Global Wealth Management business reported $1.3 billion of quarterly pre-tax profits in July, accounting for half the wider group’s total profits. That represented a 47% increase on a year earlier and its best second quarter ever, with record profits in Asia. But UBS’s resurgence in wealth management has as much to do with a new strategy code-named Elevate, which was introduced by Naratil and Khan 18 months ago, as it does with macroeconomic events. The plan was to restructure the ailing wealth business to make it more efficient and sell higher-margin products and services to UBS’s richest clients, taking advantage of the bank’s considerable heft. “I don’t think it was rocket science what we did,” said Khan in an interview with the FT. “It was all about how do you elevate the business based on the great foundation it already has.” But the emphasis on rich clients borrowing more, trading more and taking on more sophisticated products has raised concerns that UBS is taking on riskier business for the sake of bigger profits. It was a strategy Khan pursued with vigour as head of the wealth business at Credit Suisse until his dramatic departure two years ago after falling out with the group’s then chief executive Tidjane Thiam. Since the launch of Elevate in January 2020, invested assets in UBS’s wealth arm have ballooned by $595 billion, more than the total assets under management of Switzerland’s third-largest bank, Julius Baer, which Khan was close to joining as chief executive before switching to UBS. More 
While there is this deep-rooted tradition of respect of the environment in Switzerland it does not necessarily extend beyond the country's borders.  Meanwhile, UBS has lent an additional $49 billion to its clients over the past 18 months, with more specialised, higher-margin lending becoming a small but growing part of the business. “In the current environment, this strategy is working and working well,” said a senior executive at a rival Swiss bank. “But are they able to manage risk and reduce leverage if volatility picks up and there is a strong correction in the market? “This is the proof we don’t yet have and will tell us whether they are doing a good job or not.” The series of scandals engulfing Credit Suisse since Khan’s departure — including the $5.5 billion loss on the collapse of family office Archegos Capital and liquidation of $10 billion of funds linked to specialist finance firm Greensill Capital — point to the dangers of neglecting risk controls in the pursuit of profitable clients. UBS has had its own share of issues. It was hit by $861 million of losses from Archegos, having offered prime brokerage services to the business run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang. And the decision of a French court on September 27 over whether the bank should pay up to €4.5 billion in penalties for helping rich clients evade paying tax also looms. While Elevate has produced strong results for UBS so far, critics are sceptical about whether it can keep going. “Elevate has been about grabbing low-hanging fruit up till now,” said a former UBS executive. “The big question is, what’s next?” The plan to increase lending predated Khan’s arrival. But one of the first things he did when he joined was convince the group’s executive board to extend more credit to UBS’s richest clients and give them more flexibility in trading. “Some people will say you guys are pushing lending now,” said Naratil. “We don’t push lending — our clients borrow. They just don’t borrow as much from us as we would like.” 
Sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox.  Last year Khan poached one of his senior lieutenants at Credit Suisse, Remi Mennesson, to lead a new global financing team at UBS, which straddled the wealth management business and investment bank.  The UBS team was set up to offer a faster service to its richest clients, but also to explore more sophisticated lending. Rather than traditional forms of credit, such as mortgages and Lombard lending — which use the borrower’s listed securities as collateral — the so-called structured loans that Mennesson’s unit specialises in use illiquid assets, such as stakes in private companies, as collateral. Though such loans can command higher interest rates for the bank — up to double earned from Lombard lending — they are also riskier.  The majority of UBS’s lending to rich clients has taken place in the US, where Naratil said UBS is finding more demand for specialised lending. “More and more wealth is created from entrepreneurs in the new economy and companies staying private for longer,” he added.  Khan had focused Credit Suisse’s lending strategy on extending credit to the bank’s wealthy Asian clients. Among the recipients was Lu Zhengyao, chair of Chinese Starbucks rival Luckin Coffee. Thiam once feted Zhengyao as a “dream client” and “absolutely the poster child for what we want to do”. Credit Suisse had sponsored Luckin’s IPO in May 2019 but when Luckin Coffee’s shares plunged 82% last April following allegations of a $310 million fraud, Zhengyao’s family company defaulted on a $518 million margin loan. Credit Suisse was one of a handful of banks that provided the syndicated loan. More

Five new countries, including Nigeria, benefited from an automatic exchange of banking information with Switzerland bringing the total to 101.  UBS has offered relatively few structured loans so far, accounting for less than 5% of the $49 billion of gross loans provided this year. By contrast, around a quarter of Credit Suisse’s wealth loan book is in structured lending. However, in another ill-fated deal, both UBS and Credit Suisse, along with JPMorgan, jointly offered WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann a $500 million personal loan that used his WeWork stake as collateral before the group’s failed IPO in 2019. Since Ralph Hamers replaced Sergio Ermotti as UBS chief executive 10 months ago, he has presided over a period of strong growth, though analysts and shareholders have been underwhelmed by his lack of grand strategy. Khan and Naratil, however, back Hamers, saying their business has benefited from his focus on putting clients’ needs first and improving efficiency through digitisation.  But at one stage all three were fighting for the top job. And the success of Elevate will stand Khan and Naratil in good stead when the position next becomes open — but if the risks prove unmanageable then the pair could also fall.

",2022-10-13,"The public offering, which is curious by people who are in the economy and investment world or who have just entered this field, is very important for investors in terms of its meaning and conditions. In particular, investors who seek the answer to the question of what does public offering mean as an economy term, are careful in this regard. If you wish, let's examine all the answers together...
What is Public Offering?
Public Offering; With the companies offering their own stocks for sale, it offers the opportunity to all investors to become shareholders. Public offering activity means that companies and the assets held by these companies are divided into parts and put up for sale. Companies resort to public offering for various reasons.
Companies that are successful and continue to grow, in order to expand and expand their fields of activity and to fund their investments; On the other hand, companies that are economically short of resources are offered to the public in order to pay their debts or make investments, without resorting to borrowing or bank loans.
On the other hand, investors also have the opportunity to buy stocks and invest on the values ​​of companies that are traded in the stock market. Public offering is an option that gives positive results, especially in the long run.
The public offering process, which is divided into two as primary and secondary public offering; While the public offering transaction made by some companies that were not publicly traded before, is called the primary public offering; The preference of making this transaction for the second time, which has been offered to the public before, but due to the low level of public offering in the first time, is called the secondary public offering.


What Does Public Offering Mean?
In summary, the public offering, known as IPO (Initial Public Offering) in the US stock markets; It is known as the activity of companies to open their equity capital to outside investors. These investors can be both individual and corporate, and all of these investors can provide large amounts of financial resources to the equity capital of companies conducting public offerings.

",2022-10-13,"Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak announced the New Economy Program (2019-2021) prepared at the press conference he held at the Presidency Dolmabahçe Labor Office.
While the main topic of the meeting, which was eagerly awaited by Turkey and attended by leading businessmen and state officials, was ""Balancing, Discipline and Change"", the steps to be taken in this context were gathered under 7 different headings. A detail under the targets on Growth and Employment, which is the fifth of these titles, did not escape attention.
 
 Minister Albayrak announced live! Here is the 'New Economy Program'
 
According to the news of Mahmut Ekinci from Milliyet, the following statements were included in the third article of the Policy and Measures regarding Growth and Employment on the 17th page of the report shared on the official website of the Ministry of Treasury and Finance:

 
An Initial Public Offering (IPO), or more commonly known as an ""IPO,"" can be defined as the sale of stocks to called investors. While companies provide financing to themselves with this method, they make the investors a partner of the company by selling shares.

ICO, or Initial Coin Offering, is a concept that comes to the fore with cryptocurrencies. The difference of the ICO, which is just like the IPO, is that the thing to invest in is not a company, but a cryptocurrency that has not yet appeared in the markets. Cryptocurrencies that will enter the market begin to collect financing by calling potential investors during their ICO period. The ICO then takes the form of cryptocurrencies by being traded on the stock market or used in trades.
This remarkable detail in the report published by the Ministry is interpreted as a development that increases the possibility of seeing a state-supported domestic cryptocurrency in the coming period.
 
 
             ""From October, inflation will start to decline""
 
 
 




ICO software developer Erkan Kule said:

""ICO is a good idea and entrepreneurs who need the necessary financing to realize this idea directly ask for funds from investors before the project even comes to life. A well-known Ethereum is a good example. Ethereum ICO, a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency platform developed by Vitalik Buterin, invests $ 15 million. Last year alone, $8 billion was invested in ICOs.
 
             ""7 million new jobs created""
 
 


The FileCoin ICO example, which does the job of sharing the excess capacity of users' computers, also broke a record in this field with $ 250 million.
The fact that the Ministry has brought this issue to the agenda means that the state now sees ICO as a means of financing new ventures in Turkey, and probably the necessary legal arrangements are on the way.""

Saudi Aramco to start initial public offering,https://www.azernews.az/region/157895.html, 29 October 2019 17:07 (UTC+04:00),2022-10-13 03:24:30.601192,"

Saudi Aramco aims to announce the start of its initial public
offering (IPO) on Nov. 3, three people with direct knowledge of the
matter told Reuters, after delaying the deal earlier this
month to give advisers time to secure cornerstone investors,
Trend reports.
Separately, Aramco has not approached the Kuwait Investment
Authority (KIA) to invest in the IPO, the sovereign wealth fund’s
managing director Farouk Bastaki said on Tuesday.
“KIA has not been approached by Aramco or its advisers for the
IPO, and KIA will look at the IPO like any other investment,”
Bastaki told reporters on the sidelines of an investment conference
in Riyadh.
The people also said Aramco’s chief executive officer, Amin
Nasser, was not present at the conference on Tuesday as he was
meeting investors abroad ahead of the offering.
Aramco, in response to queries by Reuters, said on Tuesday the
oil company “does not comment on rumour or speculation. The company
continues to engage with the shareholders on IPO readiness
activities. The company is ready and timing will depend on market
conditions and be at a time of the shareholders’ choosing.”
The people declined to be identified due to commercial
sensitivities.
Aramco will start subscription for investors in its initial
public offering on Dec. 4, Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya said
in a news flash on Tuesday citing sources.
The oil giant plans to announce the transaction’s price on Nov.
17, it added. The company will begin trading on the local stock
market, the Tadawul, on Dec. 11, the broadcaster reported.
The company will soon have more shareholders from institutions,
the head of the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, Yassir
al-Rumayyan, said.
Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and

Oil gains amid push by Saudi Arabia for further supply cuts,https://www.azernews.az/oil_and_gas/159169.html, 3 December 2019 10:28 (UTC+04:00),2022-10-13 03:24:34.208882,"
By Trend
Oil prices rose on Tuesday, as OPEC and its allies discuss
whether to deepen a supply cut pact ahead of meetings this week,
although prospects after Saudi Arabia’s planned listing of Aramco
fuelled uncertainty for traders, limiting gains, Trend with reference to Reuters reports.
Brent futures LCOv1 rose 13 cents, or 0.2%, to $61.05 a barrel
by 0424 GMT, after gaining 0.7% on Monday.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 was up by 20 cents, or
0.4%, at $56.16 a barrel. The contract rose 1.4% on Monday.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and
its allies, a group known as OPEC+, are discussing a plan to
increase an existing supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day
(bpd) by a further 400,000 bpd and extend the pact until June, two
sources familiar with the matter said.
Saudi Arabia is pushing the plan to deliver a positive surprise
to the market before the initial public offering (IPO) of
state-owned Saudi Aramco, the sources said.
The “oil price is little moved today, suggesting that traders
are sceptical about the additional 400,000 bpd cut on top of the
extension of (the) current production cut agreement,” said Margaret
Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore.
“The question is what they are going to do after the Aramco IPO
and that creates uncertainty for the oil prices,” Yang said.
OPEC ministers will meet in Vienna on Thursday and the wider
OPEC+ group will gather on Friday.
Concerns about the inability of the United States and China, the
world’s two biggest oil users, to reach a preliminary deal to
resolve their 17-month trade dispute also weighed on oil prices,
along with discouraging U.S. economic data.
A senior adviser to President Donald Trump said a U.S.-China
trade deal was still possible before the end of the year, adding
that the first phase of the agreement was being put to paper, but
the talks have been dragging on for weeks now.
And while OPEC may cut output, U.S. producers have been only to
happy to match any market shortfalls, with production setting
successive records. Growth into 2020, though, may range between
100,000 bpd and 1 million bpd.
U.S. crude inventories are expected to have declined last week,
which may support prices, with analysts in a preliminary Reuters
polls suggesting a contraction of 1.8 million barrels.
In a sign of buying interest for oil, fund managers increased
net long positions in U.S. crude futures and options in the week to
Nov. 26, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission said.

Saudi Aramco aims to select underwriters for its initial public
offering as soon as this week, as the state energy giant
accelerates preparations for the world's biggest share sale,
reports Trend referring to Aljazeera.com.
Global investment banks are finishing up a week of pitches that
started last Tuesday in Dhahran, the eastern Saudi city where
Aramco is based, according to the people. Some firms seeking a role
on the deal made presentations in Dubai or London, the people said.
Aramco plans to tell banks later this week or early next week
whether they got a role on the offering, the people said, asking
not to be identified because the information is private.
Aramco is expected to choose about four or five banks to lead
the IPO marketing as joint global coordinators, while a larger
number will work on the deal in more junior capacities, the people
said. It is considering selling shares on the Saudi stock exchange
as soon as late this year or early next year, with a potential
international listing at a later date, the people said.
Top officials from the exchanges in London, New York and Hong
Kong have been pitching to host the IPO, Bloomberg News has
reported.
The oil producer has told Saudi investment banks that it will
invite pitches around the end of this month from local underwriters
seeking a role on the company's domestic listing, the people said.
A number of options are being considered, and no final decisions
have been made on the structure of the deal, according to the
people.

Aramco, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., didn't
immediately respond to a request for comment. The company recently
said it ""continues to engage"" with its owner on ""IPO readiness
activities"" and is ready for a share sale that will take place ""at
a time of the shareholder's choosing.""

Oil prices slip as demand concerns outweigh efforts to curb supply,https://www.azernews.az/region/154768.html, 13 August 2019 14:57 (UTC+04:00),2022-10-13 03:24:36.343292,"
By Trend
Oil prices slipped on Tuesday, offsetting narrow gains in the
previous session, as sluggish demand forecasts countered
expectations that major producers would prop up oil prices by
limiting crude oil output, reports Trend referring to Reuters.
International benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 were down 18
cents or 0.3%, from the previous settlement, to $58.39 a barrel by
0310 GMT.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 futures were at $54.81
per barrel, down by 12 cents, or 0.2%, from the last close.
“Although the outlook remains bleak, oil prices have remained
anchored this week after a rapid response from Saudi Arabia, who is
serious about stepping in to defend the oil price,” Stephen Innes,
managing partner at VM Markets Pte Ltd said in a note.
Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said late last week it plans
to keep its crude oil exports below 7 million barrels per day in
August and September to help drain global oil inventories.
Analysts expect the country to support prices ahead of its plans
to float Saudi Aramco, in what could be the world’s largest initial
public offering (IPO).
Saudi Aramco was ready for its IPO, but the timing for the deal
will be decided by its sole shareholder, the Saudi government, a
senior executive said on Monday.
Kuwait on Monday also reiterated its commitment to OPEC+ supply
curbs after Oil Minister Khaled al-Fadhel said Kuwait had cut its
own output by more than required by the accord.
OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, have agreed to cut 1.2
million barrels per day (bpd) since Jan. 1.
But booming U.S. shale oil production continues to chip away at
efforts to limit the global supply overhang, weighing on
prices.
U.S. oil output from seven major shale formations is expected to
rise by 85,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September, to a record 8.77
million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecast in
a report.
Gloomy forecasts for the global economy and oil demand growth
have also dragged on oil prices as the trade dispute between the
United States and China escalates.
“The swift reaction from Saudi Arabia will likely stabilize oil
prices, but the oil price probably won’t move much above $60 per
barrel until there is evidence of progress in U.S.-China trade
negotiations,” said Innes.
China’s central bank lowered its official yuan midpoint for the
ninth straight day to a fresh 11-year low on Tuesday to reflect
broad weakness in the local unit.
A lower yuan raises the cost of dollar-denominated oil imports
in China, the world’s biggest crude oil importer.

By Trend
Saudi Arabia’s Capital Market Authority (CMA) has approved the
initial public offering of state oil giant Aramco, in a move that
the CMA said would be valid for at least six months, Trend reports citing Sputnik.
In a statement on Sunday, the CMA also said that Aramco’s
prospectus is due to be published in the run-up to the beginning of
the subscription period.
The move comes a day after Reuters cited unnamed sources as
saying that “Crown Prince [Mohammed bin Salman] finally gave the
green light” to Aramco’s IPO.
Plans for the decision were first announced in 2016 as part of
Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 economic overhaul programme but have
been delayed a number of times.
Riyadh reportedly expects the IPO to value the oil giant at some
$2 trillion, the largest such valuation in history, which would
allow the company to raise as much as $100 billion by listing just
a 5 percent stake.

The oil facilities belonging to Aramco were attacked in
mid-September, which resulted in a temporary sharp decrease in the
kingdom's oil output.

initial public offering (IPO). The IPO involved an offer for
sale of approximately 113 million shares in Feltex held by
its then owner, Credit Suisse Asian Merchant Partners LP
(CSAMP), and an offer of approximately 29.5 million new
shares by Feltex itself. The price per share was $1.70.
By December 2006 Feltex had been placed into liquidation
and the shares were essentially worthless. The appellant,
Mr Houghton, brought a representative claim on behalf of
himself and others who had invested in Feltex shares in the
IPO, alleging that the prospectus issued by Feltex in
relation to the offer was misleading in a number of respects
and that this had caused loss to the investors. The High
Court ordered a split trial. The first hearing (the stage 1
hearing) was to deal with Mr Houghton’s claims in their
entirety. It was also to resolve issues that were common to
Mr Houghton and the other investors. Issues that were
potentially not common, like reliance and loss, were to be
dealt with at a stage 2 hearing. This appeal concerns the
issues raised in the stage 1 hearing.











First cause
of action: Securities Act 1978 The first cause
of action dealt with at the stage 1 hearing was under s 56
of the Securities Act 1978 (now repealed). In this case that
meant Mr Houghton had to prove that: (a) there was an
untrue statement in the prospectus; (b) he invested on
the faith of the prospectus; and (c) he suffered loss by
reason of the untrue statement. Section 55(a)(i) deemed a
statement to be untrue if it was misleading in the form or
context in which it was included. The s 56 claim was
brought in respect of: (a) The directors of Feltex during
the offer period, in their personal capacities. (b)
Credit Suisse Private Equity Inc (CSPE), the manager of
CSAMP, as promoter of the offer. (A claim that CSAMP was
also a promoter was not pursued in the Supreme Court.)
(c) First NZ Capital and Forsyth Barr Ltd, who were the
joint lead managers, on the basis that they were also
promoters and liable in that capacity. The High Court
held that Mr Houghton had failed to prove the prospectus
contained any untrue statements. Mr Houghton’s appeal
to the Court of Appeal was successful on one point only. The
Court of Appeal held that the forecast operating revenue for
the financial year ended 30 June 2004 (FY04) was an untrue
statement. This was because, at the time of allotment of
shares, the Feltex directors knew that the forecast would
not be achieved. They had been advised of a likely shortfall
of between $7.5 and $9 million, amounting, based on the
higher shortfall figure, to approximately 10 per cent of the
forecast for the final quarter of FY04 or 2.8 per cent for
the year. However, the Court of Appeal found that the untrue
statement was not capable of causing loss because it could
not have influenced any decision to invest. The Supreme
Court has unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal’s finding
that the FY04 revenue forecast was an untrue statement. The
Supreme Court held that even an anticipated shortfall of 2.8
per cent for the year could be considered sufficiently
significant to render the forecast untrue when considered in
the context of Feltex’s history and the cyclical nature of
the carpet market. The anticipated shortfall was even more
significant when considered against the background that the
forecast spanned a period of only three months (the first
nine months being actual figures), that the anticipated
operating revenue for those three months was approximately
10 per cent below forecast and that the fourth quarter was
traditionally one of the two best quarters for Feltex.
The Supreme Court has dismissed Mr Houghton’s appeal in
relation to other parts of the prospectus which he argued
amounted to untrue statements. The findings of the
Supreme Court related to the alleged untrue statements are
findings on common issues which bind the other investors.
On the second requirement of s 56, the Supreme Court held
that the term “on the faith of the prospectus” does not
require investors to have seen or read the prospectus. There
is an inference that investors invested in reliance on the
truth of the registered prospectus that informs the market
and thus on the faith of the prospectus. There was
nothing to suggest that Mr Houghton did not meet this test.
Whether other investors invested on the faith of the
prospectus will be for determination at the stage 2 hearing.
As to the third requirement under s 56, Mr Houghton did
not lead any evidence on the loss he suffered in the High
Court. He instead relied on an argument that his loss
equalled the whole of his investment. This was on the basis
that, once an untrue statement was proved, loss equal to the
value of the investment followed automatically. The Supreme
Court rejected that argument. The Court also rejected his
application for an inquiry into damages. Mr Houghton thus
failed to prove loss at the stage 1 hearing. This means the
end of his personal claim under the Securities Act, unless
the High Court allows him to participate in the stage 2
hearing. Contrary to the view of the Court of Appeal, the
Supreme Court held that the untrue statement in the FY04
revenue forecast was capable of causing loss. Whether in
fact it did cause loss for the investors other than Mr
Houghton will be a matter for determination at the stage 2
hearing. The Supreme Court has also held that the joint
lead managers were not promoters under s 56 on the basis
that their role fell within the professional capacity
exception in para (c) of the definition of promoter in s
2(1) of the Securities Act. The claim against the joint lead
managers under s 56 of the Securities Act was therefore
dismissed. Second cause of action: Fair Trading
Act 1986 The second cause of action was for
breach of s 9 of the Fair Trading Act 1986, which prohibits
persons in trade from engaging in misleading and deceptive
conduct. This cause of action was brought against the
directors, CSAMP, CSPE and the joint lead managers. The
High Court held that the Fair Trading Act did not apply
because of the primacy provisions in the Fair Trading Act
and Securities Act which provided that a party cannot be
liable under the Fair Trading Act for conduct which is
regulated by the Securities Act. These primacy provisions
came into force after the events in issue in Mr Houghton’s
claim. A majority of the Court of Appeal reversed that
finding, holding that the Fair Trading Act applied as the
primacy provisions did not have retrospective effect. They
found, however, that the untrue statement in the FY04
revenue forecast did not breach the Fair Trading Act. The
Supreme Court has upheld the majority’s reasoning on the
primacy provisions. However, the Supreme Court has held that
the inclusion of the untrue statement in the FY04 revenue
forecast amounted to misleading and deceptive conduct under
s 9 of the Fair Trading Act. The issue of whether there
is a remedy available under the Fair Trading Act is left for
consideration at the stage 2 hearing for all investors
including Mr Houghton. The Court has, however, dismissed
the Fair Trading Act claim against the joint lead managers,
because Mr Houghton failed to prove that the untrue
statement in the FY04 revenue forecast could be attributed
to them as primary parties. Summary
In summary, the Supreme Court has held that the
FY04 revenue forecast was an untrue statement for the
purposes of s 56(1) of the Securities Act but has rejected
all of the other claims relating to the prospectus. It has
also held that the untrue statement constituted a breach of
s 9 of the Fair Trading Act. Whether investors invested
on the faith of the prospectus and whether the untrue
statement has caused any loss to the investors other than Mr
Houghton will be determined by the High Court at the stage 2
hearing. Whether the breach of s 9 of the Fair Trading Act
leads to a remedy to the investors (including Mr Houghton)
under that Act will also be for determination at the stage 2
hearing. Judgment: 2018NZSC74.pdf

Fondul proprietatea selects investment banks for Hidroelectrica IPO,https://www.romania-insider.com/fondul-proprietatea-investment-banks-hidroelectrica-ipo,2022-09-09,13-10-2022,"Franklin Templeton, Alternative Investment Fund Manager and sole director of Fondul Proprietatea, announced that the Fund and Hidroelectrica selected the consortium of investment banks, a key milestone for the planned IPO.According to Ziarul Financiar, citing sources familiar with the deal, they are Citi, Morgan Stanley, Erste and Jefferies (global managers), Bank of America, Barclays, UBS, UniCredit and Wood (joint managers) and respectively Banca Transilvania-BCTP and Swiss Capital (co-lead managers).The role of the selected investment banks in the IPO process is to recommend the optimal structure of the transaction, promote the equity story of Hidroelectrica among local and international investors, place securities in the IPO, as well as assist with the listing process.âWe firmly believe that the IPO and the subsequent listing of Hidroelectrica will bring significant benefits to the Romanian capital markets and Romania as a whole, as it has great potential to attract significant domestic and foreign investors for the Romanian leading electricity production company,â stated Ilinca von Derenthall, Chairperson of the Board of Nominees.Rothschild & Co is Fondul Proprietatea's financial advisor in this transaction. Hidroelectrica's listing will take place after an initial public offer (IPO) in which Fondul Proprietatea plans to sell at least 15% of the company's shares, out of its 20% stake. The Romanian state, which holds the majority stake of 80% in Hidroelectrica, has approved the listing but is not willing to sell any shares.Hidroelectrica is the most valuable state-owned company in Romania and, based on its recent results, probably the most valuable company overall in the country. Fondul Proprietatea's half-year report indicated an overall valuation of EUR 12.9 bln for Hidroelectrica. Based on this figure, an IPO for 15% of the company's shares would amount to over EUR 1.9 bln, which would make it by far the biggest listing in Romania's history.Hidroelectrica was the most profitable company in Romania in 2021 and the rise in energy prices continued to push up its profits in 2022 as well.andrei@romania-insider.com(Photo source: Facebook/Hidroelectrica)"

The government reviewed the investments managed by the Fund and analyzed the preparations made for Hidroelectricaâs IPO.The government committed to taking the company public as part of the post-pandemic recovery and resilience funds package negotiated with the EU. It is now hopeful that the IPO will develop the local capital market and also improve the governance, transparency, and efficiency of its majority state-owned companies.Fondul Proprietatea, which is run by investment management service Franklin Templeton, currently holds 20% of Hidroelectrica, and plans to list at least a 15% stake during the IPO. The government will not contribute any of its shares to the listing. Nevertheless, Fondul Proprietatea estimated its shares to be worth around EUR 2.5 bln.Hidroelectrica is Romaniaâs largest hydropower energy producer, providing roughly 30% of Romaniaâs electricity. In the first trimester of 2022, Hidroelectrica saw its profit skyrocket 70% relative to last year in the context of the ongoing European energy crisis.radu@romania-insider.com(Photo source: Octav Ganea / Inquam Photos)"

Who is Peloton’s co-founder and former CEO John Foley?,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14688053/peloton-bike-founder-ceo-john-foley-net-worth-billionaire/,9 Feb 2022,2022-10-13,"JOHN Foley founded Peloton out of a need for fitting exercise into a busy work-life schedule.   The company skyrocketed throughout the pandemic, before facing a dramatic stock crash in November 2021. John Foley is the founder and former CEO of Peloton. Before he started his business venture, he was formerly the e-commerce president at Barnes & Noble. Foley also worked at Mars Inc. before founding Peloton and earned his bachelor's degree in science and industrial engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1994. In 2001, he earned an MBA from Harvard Business School. Throughout 2020 and much of 2021, Foley was worth around $1.5billion and listed on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. However, on November 4, 2021, Peloton announced a hiring freeze in light of decreased demand for its product, and the company saw shares plummet in response. As of January 2022, Foley's net worth dropped from $850million in November 2021 to $350million, according to Business Insider. The largest trade he's ever made was selling 100,000 units of Peloton Interactive Inc stock on 15 March 2021 worth more than $11,067,000.  Peloton was founded in 2013 after Foley, a cycling enthusiast, raised $307,000 to get his in-home exercise startup off the ground. He co-founded Peloton alongside Graham Stanton, Hisao Kushi, Yony Feng, and Tom Cortese. Peloton now has more than 60,000 riders and the number continues to increase as the company grows. Foley is married to fellow self-described fitness addict Jill Foley and the two reside in New York City. Peloton rose out of a need to make workouts convenient for busy people who want to stay fit.  Attending instructor-led fitness classes became difficult for the pair after they started their family. Foley thought that fitness could be easier if people could have instructor-led fitness training streamed to their homes. This led to Jill Foley running Peloton's apparel division.  The company sells branded exercise apparel in its 15 showrooms and online. John Foley has been replaced as CEO of Peloton by the former chief financial officer of Spotify and Netflix, Barry McCarthy. Along with the change in leadership, Peloton Interactive Inc. is also laying off 2,800 employees after a drop in demand led the once-hot cycling company's stock price to fall. “Barry is an incredible leader who has held senior executive roles at Spotify and Netflix and is a longtime advisor and board member at public and private technology companies,” said Foley in an open letter.  “This appointment is the culmination of a months-long succession plan that I’ve been working on with our Board of Directors, and we are thrilled to have found in Barry the perfect leader for the next chapter of Peloton.  ""I look forward to working with him and invite you to welcome him with open arms.” The change came after Peloton's stocks plummeted, resulting in what McCarthy says is a need to implement a ""succession plan."" Part of McCarthy's plan is to cut back on warehouses nationwide, ultimately saving the company more than $800million annually. The Wall Street Journal also reported that McCarthy will be laying off about 2,800 employees, equating to a roughly 20% cutback in the workforce. ""This restructuring program is the result of diligent planning to address key areas of the business and realign our operations so that we can execute against our growth opportunity with efficiency and discipline,"" Peloton commented in a press release. McCarthy claims the changes are a result of ""missteps"" the company made and its rapid growth set it behind financially. ""I love Peloton,"" McCarthy said, adding ""We own this.,"" referring to the company's alleged errors.  ""I own this,"" he said. ""And we're holding ourselves accountable.""
