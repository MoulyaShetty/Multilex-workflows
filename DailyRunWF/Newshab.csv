1,ONE store scraps IPO plan due to weak investor confidence: sources,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/one-store-scraps-ipo-plan-due-to-weak-investor-confidence-sources/,,15-07-2022,"SEOUL-- ONE store Co., a South Korean mobile app market platform, decided Wednesday to withdraw its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) due to lackluster investor confidence, financial industry sources said.

The No. 2 mobile app market operator here, after Google Play store, received lackluster response from institutional investors during a two-day demand forecasting session until Tuesday, according to the sources. Institutional bids reportedly mostly fell below the company's desired pricing band between 34,300 won ($27) and 41,700 won.

""Just this morning, ONE store considered going public by lowering the desired price, but they apparently decided to scrap the plan after concluding the company's value may not be properly recognized by the market under the current stock market situation,"" a source said.

ONE store's affiliate SK shieldus also nixed its IPO plan last week due to weak investor sentiment.

Lee Jae-hwan, CEO of ONE store, said in a press conference on Monday that the company was determined to get listed on the main bourse as planned this month, undeterred by the sister company's derailed attempt.

ONE store is the latest among several South Korean companies that have backpedaled on IPO plans so far this year. In late January, Hyundai Engineering Co., the construction arm of Hyundai Motor Group, withdrew its plan to get its stocks listed on the country's main bourse due to adverse market conditions.

ONE store logged 214 billion won in sales last year and an operating loss of 5.8 billion won. The company racked up 1.13 trillion won worth of transactions on its platform last year.

Its market share in the local mobile app market stands at some 14 percent, with Google Play's presence coming in at 71.9 percent.

2,SK shieldus eyes raising up to 3.55 tln won through IPO next month,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/sk-shieldus-eyes-raising-up-to-3-55-tln-won-through-ipo-next-month/,,15-07-2022,"SEOUL-- SK shieldus Co., a security arm of South Korean telecom giant SK Telecom Co., is expected to raise up to 3.55 trillion won (US$2.85 billion) through a planned initial public offering (IPO) next month.

The listing, set for May 19, will mark the biggest ever market debut by a security service provider, more than the value of its rival firm S-1 Corp., a security firm under Samsung Group.

""Our company integrated cybersecurity and physical security services. SK shieldus should not be compared with S-1 by one-to-one,"" CEO Park Jin-hyo said at an online conference.

SK shieldus, which changed its name from ADT Caps Co. last October, currently provides security services across four main categories -- cybersecurity, convergence security, physical security, and safety and care.

Last year, the company reported 1.55 trillion won in sales, trailing behind 2.31 trillion won recorded by S-1.

Park said the company aims to take over other security companies with higher technical skills following the IPO, and hire more personnel with expertise in platform.

SK shieldus said it set the IPO price range of 31,000-38,800 won.

Credit Suisse, the lead bookrunner, Morgan Stanley, KB Securities and NH Investment and Securities began taking orders from investors.

Demand forecasting for domestic institutions is slated for May 3 and May 4, with that for retail investors set to take place on May 9 and May 10.

3,SK On’s IPO unlikely to take place until after 2025: SK Innovation CEO,https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/sk-ons-ipo-unlikely-to-take-place-until-after-2025-sk-innovation-ceo/,,15-07-2022,"SEOUL-- SK On Co. is not considering an initial public offering (IPO) for at least another two to three years but will build up its competitiveness and enhance corporate value before pushing for a market debut, head of its parent company said Thursday.

The potential listing of SK On has drawn attention since the battery unit was spun off from SK Innovation in October last year, as part of SK's push to bolster the battery business amid growing demand from global automakers vying for a bigger share in the electric vehicle market.

""What's the most important for an IPO to take place is that we need to have our battery business recognized in the market,"" Kim Jun, CEO and vice chairman of SK Innovation Co., told reporters after a general shareholders meeting.

""I expect that we should be able to deliver the performance, in terms of sales, profitability and stable management of equipment, after 2025, and I believe it would be after 2025 if we were to do an IPO,"" he said.

Its bigger rival, LG Energy Solution Ltd., set a record IPO in January that made the battery maker the second-largest company in South Korea by market cap, reflecting the global electrification trend.

Kim said SK On is at the pre-IPO stage to raise funds from investors in advance of going public.

""We need large-scale resources as we are continuing with the facility expansion ... We plan to sign the contracts (on the investments) in the first half,"" Kim said.

Industry sources predict SK On is seeking to raise between 3 and 5 trillion won (US$2.47-4.12 billion), which amounts to about a 10 percent stake in the company.

Kim forecast SK On will swing to the black in the fourth quarter of this year and achieve an annual surplus from next year. SK Innovation's battery business logged an operating loss of 683.1 billion won in the fourth quarter of last year.

In light of any possible advance into new businesses, Kim said he is looking at areas of ""non-carbon, or low-carbon energy sources,"" and discussing various ideas with SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, without elaborating further.

Earlier this month, Chey hinted at ""drawing up a new business map that incorporates energy and environment"" during a visit to a SK Innovation factory in a southwestern city.

4,"Money raised through IPOs hits record high in 2021 amid ample liquidity, bullish sentiment",https://www.koreanewsgazette.com/money-raised-through-ipos-hits-record-high-in-2021-amid-ample-liquidity-bullish-sentiment/,,15-07-2022,"SEOUL– The amount of money South Korean firms raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) more than quadrupled to hit a record high last year thanks to ample liquidity and the overall bullish stock market sentiment, data showed Monday.

A total of 89 companies went public in 2021 by listing stocks on the benchmark KOSPI and secondary tech-heavy KOSDAQ markets and raised a combined 19.7 trillion won (US$16.4 billion), according to the data from the Financial Supervisory Service.

The money raised from IPOs represented a 333.9 percent surge from 4.5 trillion won a year earlier, the data showed. The number of companies whose shares listed on the stock markets for the first time also jumped from the previous year’s 70.

The IPO market was driven by the overall rise in local stock markets and ample liquidity injected into the economy bolstered by low borrowing costs in line with record low policy rates intended to boost the pandemic-hit economy.

Investors got more interested in new stock listings, with the competition ratio for IPO stocks jumping to an average of 1,136 to 1 last year, up from the 956-to-1 ratio a year earlier.

The prices of newly listed stocks closed 57.4 percent higher on average on their first trading day, compared with their IPO prices. The return marked the highest in five years, the data showed.

Their average prices also jumped 54.8 percent at the end of last year from the IPO prices. But of the companies that went private, 28 firms, or 31.5 percent, saw their stocks fall below the IPO prices at the end of last year, the data showed.
