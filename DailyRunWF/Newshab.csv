									Kakao Mobility at crossroads amid sell-off rumors								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220710000080&ACE_SEARCH=1,10-7-2022,2022-07-15,"
A couple of taxis using Kakao Mobility’s ride-hailing service Kakao T wait for passengers in front of Seoul station on June 28. (Yonhap)A dispute between Kakao Corp. management and its labor union is growing over the IT giant’s rumored attempt to sell its transportation service subsidiary Kakao Mobility to private equity firm MBK Partners. Kakao’s labor union on Wednesday accused the management of giving up on its mobility business, questioning if the sell-off to the private equity fund can help the business grow.According to the union’s statement, Kakao Corp. said its mobility platform cannot grow anymore under its wing, and that the IT giant has no intention of continuing with the mobility business. It added that Kakao’s management said the sale was necessary for the business to expand. The union sees the sale of Kakao Mobility as an attempt to prevent Kakao founder Kim Beom-su from being asked to appear at the National Assembly’s state audit this year. It said it would resume collecting signatures from Kakao Corp. employees for a petition, which was launched in June when rumors of a sale first began swirling, to oppose the deal. Shortly after the union’s statement was released, Bae Jae-hyun, the company’s chief investment officer, downplayed the sale rumors. He said in an internal notice that the company has never considered an entire sell-off.“What we are considering is changing Kakao’s stake in (Kakao Mobility) to become the second-largest shareholder by selling (a 10-19 percent stake),” he said. This suggests MBK would also buy shares from other owners to become the largest shareholder. Kakao Corp. owns a 57.5 percent stake in Kakao Mobility while a consortium led by US private equity firm TPG holds a 29 percent stake and the Carlyle Group has a 6.2 percent stake.The CIO added that the company is contemplating how Kakao Mobility can grow bigger beyond Kakao Corp.’s boundaries, saying no decisions had been made. The union last month met with the IT giant’s leadership including Kim Sung-su, chairman of the board of directors, to oppose the sale.Kakao Mobility went into turmoil after June 14 when it was reported that MBK Partners -- one of the largest private equity firms in Asia -- was in talks with the IT giant to buy a 40 percent stake in Kakao Mobility, which was valued at 8.5 trillion won ($6.6 billion).   Despite Kakao Corp.’s explanation that nothing was decided at the time, the sudden news sparked outcry from employees, as the company even had picked underwriters in March to go public on the Korea Exchange this year. Kakao’s labor union then began collecting signatures of employees and staged protests to oppose the sale of Kakao Mobility. The union denounced Kakao Corp.’s leadership for reneging on its promise to undergo an initial public offering. Previous IPOs of Kakao subsidiaries have included stock options for employees.Prospects of a stock listing have faded due to weak market conditions and damage to the corporation’s image after Kakao Pay executives dumped shares in the company in December last year. The executives, including Ryu Young-joon, CEO of Kakao Corp.’s mobile payment unit, exercised their stock options to sell company shares only a month after Kakao Pay’s listing, reaping a windfall of almost 90 billion won.“Kakao pulled out the sell-off card just three months after it had vowed to carry out shareholder-friendly policies. Isn’t the company trying to retrieve its investment in a different way as the option of going public is likely blocked?” said the union. A staffer at one of Kakao Corp.’s subsidiaries told The Korea Herald that Kakao Mobility employees have been feeling “uneasy” as the direction of the company is now unclear. “We don’t know too much about what’s going on with the rumored sell-off. We just hope things become clear soon,” said the staffer who requested anonymity. Kakao Corp. is under pressure to resolve things one way or another, as an IPO this year was among the conditions of the minority shareholders’ investments in Kakao Mobility. It is almost certain that there would be penalty clauses for failing to list, such as a requirement to buy back shares at an elevated price or to engage in a joint sale to a third party.But with the stock market in freefall, MBK Partners will be in no hurry to complete the acquisition, according to an analyst at a local private equity firm. “The value of technology stocks has decreased, so I think it is unlikely (for MBK Partners) to buy (Kakao Mobility) at the value of 8.5 trillion won. MBK Partners has no reason to go for that price at the moment,” he said. The analyst noted that MBK Partners will also consider tag-along rights of TPG and the Carlyle Group during negotiations with Kakao Corp. Tag-along rights allow minority shareholders to sell their shares if a majority shareholder is negotiating a stake sale. If MBK Partners were to acquire a 40 percent stake from Kakao Corp. as well as all shares owned by TPG and the Carlyle Group, it would approximately cost 6.4 trillion won. “Such a large deal could put some burden on MBK Partners, so won’t they try to push the price further down?” the analyst said. Since the second half of last year, Kakao Mobility has been under fire for hiking ride-hailing fees and expanding into new business areas to provide designated driver services, quick delivery and parcel delivery. The mobility application operator faced heat from the public as its expanded services drove small merchants and business owners out of work.  An IT industry source told The Korea Herald that the sale of Kakao Mobility could give Kakao Corp. some breathing room. “Kakao’s public image has worsened over the past year and Kakao Mobility was one of the major reasons behind that. So I think Kakao might want to detach itself from the mobility business. If a deal is made, it would give Kakao instant cash,” the source said. After Kakao Mobility began as a spinoff subsidiary from Kakao Corp. in 2017, it quickly became the country’s largest mobility platform service provider. Kakao Mobility has 30 million cumulative users and 10 million monthly active users, as of July.The company recorded annual sales of 546 billion won last year, almost doubling from 2020, and posted operating profits of 12.5 billion won to be in the black for the first time.By Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)

									[Newsmaker] Internet-only banks lure customers with Tamagotchi-like savings accounts, digital piggy banks								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220701000469&ACE_SEARCH=1,1-7-2022,2022-07-15,"
Advertisement for Toss Bank`s savings account(Toss Bank)Saving money is never fun. But when combined with a digital pet that grows alongside the size of your savings, it can be more motivating. South Korea’s three internet-only banks -- KakaoBank, K bank and Toss Bank -- have launched unique products such as Tamagotchi-like savings accounts, mobile joint accounts and digital piggy banks to lure customers attracted to the trends. Toss Bank, launched in October last year, has registered 3.6 million users in just eight months through a slew of unique savings products and digital-friendly services. One of them is a Tamagotchi-like savings account in which a user can see a randomly selected digital pet -- turtle, octopus, colt or ghost -- grow with deposits for six months. The digital pet idea has been met with booming demand, as Toss opened 100,000 new accounts within 72 hours of its launch on June 14. Users can deposit a maximum 1 million won ($773) per month for a total of six months with a yield of 3 percent. “The act of saving money requires time and patience, and we wanted to change that time into a fun experience of raising a cute pet for our users,” Toss Bank CEO Hong Min-take told reporters at a media event in Seoul on Tuesday. Toss Bank also plans to launch a joint mobile account “soon,” Hong added, which will cater to friends and groups seeking to split the bill for their favorite activities. The nation’s No. 1 internet-only bank by users, KakaoBank -- with 19.13 million users -- has rolled out various accounts and services tied to its sister company and top mobile messenger KakaoTalk. In this sense, 11.39 million users had opened one of its joint accounts as of May. KakaoTalk currently has some 45 million monthly active users in a country of about 51 million.Its short-term 26-week savings account, a rare product here, was met with high demand upon its launch on June 21, registering 150,000 new accounts within 72 hours. The bank’s piggy bank services are also a key product, allowing users to make deposits of less than 1,000 won on its mobile account daily. The bank managed some 4.35 million piggy bank accounts as of the end of April. K bank is somewhat behind its two rivals in providing unique services, but it is the only mobile bank here providing a real-name account for cryptocurrency trading. Its partnership with local crypto exchange Upbit, signed in June 2020, has helped more than triple its users from 2.19 million in 2020 to some 7 million as of end-2021. K bank’s initial public offering plans, which have been stalled for years, have been gaining pace with the firm filing for a preliminary review for listing on the Korean market with the Korea Exchange on Thursday. Its IPO is predicted to be valued at at least 6 trillion won and the firm is forecast to debut in November, according to market watchers. Korea’s internet-only banks have been expanding quickly in recent years, backed by an increase in the use of smartphones and keeping traditional lenders on their toes with user-friendly services. KakaoBank’s earnings jumped about 80 percent on-year in 2021, with net income amounting to 204.12 billion won, according to a regulatory filing. Operating profit more than doubled over the cited period to 256.94 billion won, and sales also expanded 32.4 percent on-year to 1.06 trillion won.K bank recorded a net profit of 22.4 billion won last year, swinging into the black from a net loss of 105.4 billion won the previous year. Toss Bank, being relatively new to the market, has yet to release its earnings. Its total loans stood at some 4 trillion won as of last month, with 36 percent being taken out by low- and mid-rated customers.(mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

									Kakao Pay employees each lose W20m over stock dip								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220612000131&ACE_SEARCH=1,12-6-2022,2022-07-15,"
(Kakao Pay)Kakao Pay employees who own shares in their own company each lost an average 20 million won ($15,600) due to the mobile payment firm’s stock price plunge since January, reports said Sunday. The company’s employee stock ownership association purchased a total 3.4 million shares in Kakao Pay at the price of 90,000 won per share prior to its initial public offering on Nov. 3 last year, according to a regulatory filing. Documents show that some 800 employees received an average 4,005 shares each, valued at 360.4 million won at the time of the firm’s market debut. It had set the IPO price at 90,000 won per share, opened at the price of 180,000 won and closed higher at 193,000 won on its first day.But Kakao Pay employees have each lost some 20 million won after the company’s share price plunged over a slew of risks since January, the reports said. The mobile payment operator hit a 52-week-low in terms of closing price on Friday with 85,100, closing 3.73 percent lower from the previous session.Kakao Pay shares lost its rally after it was found in January that former CEO Ryu Young-joon and seven other executives offloaded 90 billion won of company shares by exercising stock option in December, only a month after the company went public. Furthermore, the firm’s second-largest shareholder Alipay dumped 5 million shares -- about 10 percent of the total stake it holds in Kakao Pay -- in a block deal, sending the payment platform operator’s price down 15.57 percent from the previous closing to 89,500 won on Wednesday. Alipay remains the second-largest shareholder, with a 34.72 percent stake in the Korean firm. Members of Kakao Pay’s employee stock ownership association are legally obligated to keep their shares until Nov. 3 this year, a year since the firm’s IPO launch. (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

									[Market Eye] Kakao share prices stall as company struggles to regain public trust								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220608000878&ACE_SEARCH=1,8-6-2022,2022-07-15,"
Graphs showing the change in stock price for Kakao, Kakao Pay and KakaoBank (The Korea Herald)Kakao Pay shares tumbled Wednesday morning after it was reported that its second-largest shareholder Alipay was looking to sell 5 million shares -- about 10 percent of the total stake it holds in Kakao Pay -- in a block deal. The stock price of Kakao Pay fell 15.57 percent to close at 89,500 won. Despite the sell-off, the payment arm of IT giant Kakao said Alipay will continue to be a strategic investor and remain the second-largest shareholder, with 34.72 percent of Kakao Pay shares, and the two sides will carry on with their strong partnership. Experts, however, said this could be the beginning of an ugly turn of events. An analyst at a local securities firm told The Korea Herald that the risk of overhang remains with Alipay’s block deal. “Alipay holds a lot more Kakao Pay shares, so it could sell some of the remaining amount or more. This possibility of dumping off shares has a negative impact for other shareholders as it was seen in today’s price drop,” the analyst said. Park Sang-hyun, an insight provider at independent investment research network Smartkarma, pointed out that Alipay’s return on its Kakao Pay investment is 10 times, so it may be natural to realize a profit to some extent. “But the local market believes that the strategic partnership is cracking, starting with this stake sale. It is highly likely that Alipay will go through a multiphased stake sale process,” Park added. The sharp drop in Kakao Pay’s stock price marked the latest hiccup in a series of disappointments for Kakao Group in the past nine months.In June 2021, Kakao Group became South Korea’s fifth-largest business group in terms of market capitalization at 79.3 trillion won ($65.1 billion), behind the country’s traditional conglomerates: Samsung, SK, LG and Hyundai Motor Group. About a month later, Kakao founder Kim Beom-su was ranked as the richest person in the country by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His net worth was estimated at $13.4 billion. The report said Kim was an exemplary case of how a self-made entrepreneur could succeed in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, which has long been dominated by its family-controlled conglomerates.The tech giant, which rose to prominence with its messenger app KakaoTalk, climbed up the ladder through aggressive expansion of businesses. At the end of the first half of 2021, Kakao had over 150 subsidiaries and affiliates in and out of the country. However, the platform behemoth’s heyday did not last long. The company -- once touted for the legendary tale of its self-made entrepreneur founder and the success of technological innovation in the 21st century -- has undergone a series of blunders and setbacks in recent months. In September, Kakao’s people-friendly image first faced criticism over the company’s rapid expansion, said to have driven small merchants out of business. That led to Kakao’s pledge to pull back some of the company’s services in industries such as snacks and flower delivery.To avert public criticism, Kakao vowed to create a fund of 300 billion won to support small firms and the self-employed, but its misfortunes continued.In the same month, the founder’s investment company K Cube Holdings -- the de facto holding company of Kakao -- was accused of having private interests as well as the illegal succession of family members in employment. More allegations piled on, as K Cube Holdings was accused of fabricating regulatory documents.Kim later apologized at a National Assembly state audit, saying the investment company would change to be committed to social responsibilities.A series of megasized initial public offering deals that further raised Kakao’s market profile, ironically, exposed the root cause for its downfall.A mass sale of Kakao Pay shares by executives including Ryu Young-joon, the then-appointee for Kakao’s next co-CEO, struck the company hard in January.Ryu, who was CEO of Kakao’s mobile payment unit Kakao Pay, was found to have exercised his stock option to sell company shares in December, only a month after the company’s listing. Through this, he and several senior executives collected a total profit of almost 90 billion won, with Ryu taking about half of the gains. Kakao saw fierce backlash from the company’s labor union, retail investors and the general public as the executives raked in massive profits at the expense of investors. Combined with the group’s hasty expansion that had hit small businesses last year, the irresponsible money-making decision raised concerns over whether the IT group could maintain accountable corporate governance. Kakao released an apology, vowing to ban CEOs and executives at its subsidiaries from selling company shares within one to two years after being listed on the market through setting up a new control tower. In March, Kim resigned from his chairman post of the board of directors, leaving behind ailing stock prices and loss of trust among investors.   Kakao’s stock price, which hit as high as 169,500 won per share at the close of June 23, 2021, has halved to a little over 80,000 won per share almost a year later. The stock prices of Kakao Pay and KakaoBank have also suffered similar or worse downfalls, losing trillions of won in the process. On top of losing confidence from the market, the IT giant has irked its own crew.Last week, Kakao unveiled its new “metaverse” working system where employees could basically work wherever they want. The seemingly future-oriented scheme, however, was met with internal resistance from employees, as the new system would require being connected online through a voice channel at all times. Kakao workers expressed concerns and discontent on an in-house online community space, saying the new policy was as an attempt to spy on employees. Kakao CEO Namkoong Whon later said in an announcement to staff that being connected to the voice channel would be decided by crew members in different groups or work areas, but did not scrap the plan. Regarding the implementation of a mandatory working time from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., he said the company will reconsider the plan through communication with staff. Without working on mending ties with stakeholders in and out of the company, Kakao instead unveiled its new vision, “Kakao Universe,” on Tuesday, saying it wants to go beyond Korea. The CEO said they will look to reach 5 billion people across the world through open links that connect them based on their interests instead of targeting South Korea’s 50 million domestic users. But if Kakao cannot redeem itself as the people-friendly company it once was with the rise of its dominant messenger app, experts say it will be difficult for the company to win back people’s hearts and bounce back. “I think Kakao’s stock prices are not doing well due to its subsidiaries going public. Naver has only one entity in the bourse, but Kakao’s other firms have been listed and this has cemented Kakao’s image as a firm that conducts (IPOs) to sell shares to make money,” an analyst at a local private equity firm told The Korea Herald. “Kakao’s growth has been done through mergers and acquisitions, as well as some unethical moves such as taking the business of small merchants. Its corporate governance is also seemingly abominable,” he added.By Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)

									E-book platform Millie’s Library to go public by end of 2022								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220529000158&ACE_SEARCH=1,29-5-2022,2022-07-15,"
Corporate logo of Millie’s Library (Millie’s Library)Millie’s Library, one of South Korea’s largest e-book subscription platform, said Sunday that it is set for a market debut by the end of this year.The company filed a preliminary prospectus on Friday stating that it will offer 2 million common shares out of the total 8,234,901 shares. If the initial public offering process goes as planned, it will be the country’s first e-book platform to go public.Its shares are poised to start trading on the Korea Exchange’s secondary Kosdaq. The lead manager of the envisioned IPO is Mirae Asset Securities.The corporate value of Millie’s Library is estimated to be around 300 billion won ($239 million), according to market insiders.With funds raised from the IPO, the company plans to invest in the production of original book content as well as other content.The company’s sales revenue surged on-year by 61 percent to 28.9 billion won last year. However, it posted an operating loss of 34.8 billion won, and has still not turned a profit.Millie’s Library has been seeking to accelerate growth momentum after it was acquired by Genie Music, the music streaming platform under KT, in 2021. Genie Music currently holds 39 percent of the shares of the company.Working with the KT artificial intelligence business unit, the e-book platform plans to create synergy with an AI-based audio platform to produce more content, including audiobooks.Last year, Seo Young-taek, CEO of Millie’s Library, said if the company’s intellectual property-based business model is well received, its value will exceed the 500 billion won of Radish, the US webtoon platform acquired by Kakao Entertainment. In the long term, the company looks to achieve more than 1 trillion won in value, Seo added.But concerns loom over the e-book platform’s debut amid a lackluster IPO market and an ongoing slump in platform giants such as Naver and Kakao, industry sources said. Naver’s stock price has traded below 300,000 won since late April, while Kakao is also showing sluggish movement between 80,000 and 90,000 won in the citied period.“The company has grown exponentially to become the country’s largest online library platform in just six years. Based on our vision -- ‘become friends with an unlimited number of books’ -- we will expand the presence in the book content market,” Seo said in a statement. Launched in 2017, Millie’s Library services 110,000 e-books through 1,400 publishers as of May. The company is the first here to provide an e-book subscription service. It produces audiobooks, “chat books,” which are books re-created in a chatting format, and audio dramas.By Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)

									Taiwan’s Fubon Financial becomes third-largest shareholder in Hyundai Card								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220520000488&ACE_SEARCH=1,20-5-2022,2022-07-15,"
Hyundai Card headquarters in Seoul (Hyundai Card)Taiwanese banking giant Fubon Financial on Friday raised its stake in South Korea’s Hyundai Card to nearly 20 percent, expanding its clout over management of the card issuer. Fubon Financial is now the card issuer’s third-largest shareholder with 19.98 percent after Hyundai Motor with 36.96 percent and Hyundai Commercial with 28.56 percent. Kia Corp. is the fourth-largest stakeholder with 11.48 percent. The latest announcement puts a final stamp on the exit of a consortium led by Hong Kong-based private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners from the card issuer, which previously owned a 24 percent threshold. Since last year, Affinity had sold its some 20 percent stake to Fubon Financial’s commercial banking unit Fubon Bank and life insurer Fubon Life Insurance for roughly 520 billion won ($409 million). The remaining 4 percent stake was sold to Hyundai Commercial. The move comes four years after the consortium bought the same number of shares for 380 billion won. It also effectively nullifies the Affinity’s initial request made in 2017 for Hyundai Card to complete its initial public offering within four years of the stake purchase, indefinitely delaying the possible listing. “There are no immediate plans for an IPO,” Hyundai Card said in a statement in the day. Early this year, Hyundai Card’s two outside directors from Affinity left their posts to be replaced by Douglas Tsai, management associate at Fubon Financial Holding. The company is expected to fill the vacant post with another Fubon official. “Fubon Financial has highly regarded Hyundai Card’s potential to further grow as a private label credit card issuer alongside our data science and branding skills as our strategic investor,” the card issuer said in a statement. A private label credit card is a credit card that offers more benefits for use at a specific brand‘s stores. Fubon Financial was founded in 1961 with multiple subsidiaries including Fubon Life, Taipei Fubon Bank, Fubon Securities, Fubon Asset Management and more. As of the end of 2021, Fubon Financial Holdings had unaudited net assets of $10.51 trillion. At the end of 2015, Fubon Life purchased a 48 percent stake in Hyundai Life Insurance, to rebrand it as Fubon Hyundai Life.Hyundai Card’s net profit in the first three months of this year declined 4 percent on-year to 76.9 billion won, according to regulatory filing.By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)

									One Store pulls IPO plan, SK Square pressured to change course								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220511000885&ACE_SEARCH=1,11-5-2022,2022-07-15,"
A promotional image of One Store app store (One Store)South Korea’s homegrown mobile app store operator One Store has dropped its plan to go public amid poor stock market conditions, the company said Wednesday.One Store’s decision comes a day after a book building of institutional investors wrapped up, in which the offering price of a common share was below its suggested price band, at between 34,300 won ($26.9) and 41,700 won apiece. The figures have estimated One Store’s equity value at between 910 billion won and 1.1 trillion won. The decision came in contrast with the company officials’ pledge to proceed with the IPO at all costs, as expressed in a press conference Monday. Officials including Chief Executive Officer Lee Jae-hwan touted One Store as a challenger in the app store market globally dominated by Google and Apple. One Store said in a statement the decision is attributable to “heightening macroeconomic uncertainties that sapped investor sentiment in the stock market,” despite “positive feedback on the company fundamentals” by institutional investors.One Store’s announcement marks the sixth of its kind, following companies including its sister company SK Shieldus and corrugated cardboard maker Tailim Paper.One Store’s shareholders include Korean internet giant Naver, US tech giant Microsoft and Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, in addition to SK Square.Accordingly, its parent SK Square is pressured to change courses from its plan to enhance corporate value through a soft landing of its subsidiaries on the stock market. SK Shieldus, a security services subsidiary of the investment body, also withdrew its bid to go public on Friday. The decision, combined with One Store’s case, is casting a shadow on SK Square’s plan to list more subsidiaries including e-commerce arm 11st. SK Square’s share price hit yet another all-time low. Its shares fell 3.25 percent Wednesday. The market cap of SK Square nearly halved to 6.3 trillion won from the highest point in late November, as soon as the company was spun off from Korea’s largest mobile carrier SK Telecom.

									Yoon likely to expand loan support for ‘vulnerable’ groups								",http://www.koreaherald.com//view.php?ud=20220511000747&ACE_SEARCH=1,11-5-2022,2022-07-15,"
President Yoon Suk-yeol at the National Assembly. (Yonhap)The Yoon Suk-yeol government is looking to make it easier for “vulnerable groups” to take out loans to follow through on his campaign promise, while offering better protection to consumers from predatory lending and unfair corporate practices.The groups refer to self-employed people, small business owners, first-time home buyers and those fresh out of college who the government says need more financial support than all the others. COVID fallout and runaway housing prices have put them in greater focus.“We have yet to receive a clear directive on details but given what’s been said so far, we expect expanding support for the financially challenged groups,” an official at the Financial Services Commission said.The official was referring to Yoon’s “Target 110,” an agenda laying out 110 goals Yoon has given priority. Yoon’s office revealed it last week ahead of Yoon’s swearing in on Tuesday.Financial authorities are preparing concrete steps, such as offering more favorable interest rates, rolling over maturing loans and reducing debts for the self-employed and small businesses to help them recoup losses caused by COVID-19.For first-time home buyers and those seeking to open and expand their savings account from their first job, the government is considering partially easing a long set of mortgage rules and allowing more favorable terms on the savings accounts.Meanwhile, the Yoon government is expected to put a greater check on banks seeking to inflate interest rates -- a complaint consumers have long filed with authorities.Financial services companies would also face a higher burden of proof for any security breaches that violate consumers’ interests, according to authorities. Banks have long been accused of shifting the burden of proof to consumers or regulators to reduce damages to pay.Authorities added that they will deal with unfair corporate practices, referring to a contentious spinoff LG Chem carried out and the stock options row at Kakao Pay, which all took place in January this year.Individual investors holding shares in LG Chem, which wholly owned LG Energy Solution before the world’s second-largest battery maker went public in what was Korea’s record listing, cried foul over the lack of regulation for what they saw as a corporate practice that unfairly diluted their share value. A similar spinoff also took place to float Kakao Pay, a payment arm of Korea’s leading chat app operator Kakao Corp., which is one of the two internet giants along with Naver.But it was a stock price fall that brought down the CEO at Kakao Pay, where the senior management including the CEO exercised stock options a month after the initial public offering, causing what investors called an “unwarranted dip” in stock prices. The bourse operator have had to roll out rules to oversee spinoff IPOs done by large-cap companies and lockup periods on executives looking to offload shares following an IPO, when shares could potentially run higher than expected on investor optimism. Such rule change is one of many to come to level the playing field for consumers, authorities said.By Choi Si-young (siyoungchoi@heraldcorp.com)

(One Store)South Korea’s homegrown app marketplace One Store aims to challenge Google and Apple, two US tech giants that enjoy a near-monopoly in the whopping 300 trillion won ($235 billion) app store market globally, with its forthcoming stock market debut here. One Store, the nation’s sole operator of an app store of the same name, is a merged entity of the nation’s four app stores that was previously operated separately by SK Telecom, KT, LG Uplus and Naver. Now it is an affiliate of SK Square, SK Group’s investment unit.In its push for global expansion, it plans to secure a footing first in Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan by the end of this year, and then Europe and North America in the long run. “Korea is the only app store market in the world which made its way out of an app store monopoly,” One Store Chief Executive Officer Lee Jae-hwan told a news conference in Seoul Monday. “To the global market, One Store is close to being among the only options, given the time and cost it takes for a country to create a new app store from scratch.”Lee cited an estimate by IGAWorks Mobile Index that showed One Store beat Apple with 13.8 percent of market share in 2021 and trailed just behind Google. The company also estimated the total transactions on its marketplace at 1.13 trillion won through 2021, exceeding the 1 trillion won per year mark for the first time. Moreover, One Store will benefit from the world’s efforts to break the app store monopoly and its own localization efforts. There are bills pending designed to curtail tech giants’ monopolistic behavior, such as the Open App Markets Act in the United States and the Digital Market Act in the European Union. These bills are expected to open up a new opportunity to the Korean marketplace, dedicated to mobile gaming apps, media content like webtoons and gaming gear, Lee said.Also, One Store charges customers lower commission fees for users compared with Google and Apple at home. The same policy will be applied to the overseas market, according to Lee. Moreover, One Store will support a wider range of payment options including vouchers, bank-to-bank transfers and prepaid cards. “We are seeing a strong pressure worldwide to open the doors to new app store operators, and we expect the entry barrier to disappear by late this year or early next year,” Lee said. Part of the cost for its overseas expansion will come from its initial public offering later this month, which could fetch up to 277.7 billion won. Immediately after the IPO, its market cap is expected to stand at up to 1.1 trillion won. This comes despite the unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and investors’ resulting flight to safety that have weighed down on the stock market. Its sister company SK Shieldus, a cybersecurity service company, withdrew from its bid to offer shares to the public on Friday. The company cited “jittery” market sentiment as its book building drew lackluster attention from institutional investors, reeling from macroeconomic concerns such as Russia‘s invasion of Ukraine and the US interest rate hike to fight inflation.Both SK Shieldus and One Store are controlled by SK Square, a carveout of Korea’s largest mobile carrier SK Telecom. SK Square’s share price hit an all-time low as it fell 5.3 percent on Monday. A One Store official said the company will go on to proceed with the IPO at all costs, considering the low IPO price at nearly the purchase price set in a $15 million equity investment by Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, a joint investment body by Microsoft and Deutsche Telekom.“We think it is the right timing to do the IPO. If we don’t we are losing the opportunity to grow our global presence,” One Store Chief Financial Officer Kim Sang-don said. One Store has never been in the black since it was founded in 2016. The company in 2021 recorded a 5.8 billion won operating loss, up over fivefold in a year. Kim anticipated a turnaround in 2022 with some 5 billion won operating profit.(consnow@heraldcorp.com)
