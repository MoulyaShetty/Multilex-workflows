The bank should resort to the investing public to raise 340 million cedis which represents about fifty percent of the company’s stake.

The processes commenced in March this year; seven months after the announcement of the new minimum capital for banks.

The 2018 half year performance of Energy bank shows that its total income increased by 72 percent between 5 million cedis compared to the estimated 3 million cedis recorded in the same period last year.
 
Similarly, the bank’s profit after tax increased a significant growth of over 400 percent to record 985 million cedis between January and June this year; compared to the 196 million cedis recorded the same period last year.
 
Energy bank is expected to now engage the IC Securities is the Transaction Adviser and is expected to market the shares to many investors within the country.
 
When the IPO is successful, Energy bank will be the eleventh commercial bank to list on the Ghana Stock Exchange.

Minister of the Public Business Sector Hisham Tawfik has said on Monday that preparations are underway to offer stakes in two state-owned companies, including Banque du Caire.
 
Tawfik declared in April that the second wave will involve new sectors that are not listed on the Egyptian Stock Market (EGX) in a bid to attract more investments and energise the stock market, as well as provide cash liquidity in the domestic market.





The governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has announced that Banque du Caire will offer a stake of its shares, ranging between 30 and 40 percent, which is expected to garner between $300 million and $400 million at the most.
 
Official sources say that the government will also offer a share of 10 to 15 percent of E-finance, a national company which is operating the Egyptian government's financial network with a paid capital of EGP 350.5 million, to be the second company offered alongside Banque du Caire.
 
Head of E-finance Ibrahim Sarhan told Ahram Online that the offering ""is subject to the government’s will, it is not a final order.""
 
“We are already working on studying the market. We will finish our work within a month-and-a-half and all the results of our study will be announced in a press conference before the offering process,” Sarhan added.
 
The second phase of the IPO will include new sectors that do not exist on the Egyptian stock exchange, which will attract more investors, Minister Tawfik said.
 
Tawfik added that the strategic objectives of the government’s IPO programme are to expand the ownership base, increase governance practices and private sector participation in management, and provide the necessary financing to restructure and develop companies.
 
He stressed that the offering will be for profitable companies only, noting that good preparation and timing are among the most important guarantees for the success of the proposal process.
 
“It also depends on external factors, including macro-economic, global markets, and other internal factors related to the stability of the company's operations,"" he said.
 
The minister also emphasised the importance of the role of the investor relations officer.
 
In 2016, Egypt announced the launch of the IPO programme by offering a portion of state-owned company’s shares in the EGX to revive the market as part of the country's economic reform programme.
 
The goal from the IPO is to attract investments flows to the domestic market and make ultimate use of state assets.
 
The programme is scheduled to be fully implemented within three to five years over 23 companies and banks in various sectors, including real estate, services, petroleum, and chemicals, targeting to collect approximately EGP 8 billion, according to the financial initial statement of the fiscal year FY2019/20 budget.
 
Previously, in March, Egypt offered a stake of 4.5 percent of Eastern Company’s shares on the EGX with a total value of EGP 1.72 billion. Emirati Mohamed Alabbar and Saudi Arabian investors had acquired more than 25 percent of the company's shares with a total of EGP 400 million."

According to the 2017 Africa Capital Markets Watch by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) had no IPOs raised in either 2016 or 2017.
 
In the last five years, the NSE has only been able to raise Sh4.2 billion ($42 million) through two IPOs offered in 2014 and 2015 raising Sh700 million and Sh3.5 billion respectively.
 
“There were also no IPO activity in 2017 in Ghana compared to 2016, which saw $102 million raised on the Ghana Stock Exchange.

This year, the Nairobi Securities Exchange and Nigeria Stock Exchange both extended their IPO drought, with no new IPO capital raised in either 2016 or 2017,” the report said.
 
In contrast, elsewhere on the continent, 2017 saw some significant increases in IPO value on exchanges in Namibia, Rwanda and Tanzania compared to 2016.
 
This increased activity can be attributed to a combination of continued efforts by governments to either privatise stakes in state-owned entities or encourage local companies to list on domestic exchanges to build local market participation, and in certain situations, regulatory requirements compelling certain companies in certain sectors to list.
 
Over a five-year period, the vast majority of Further Offer (FO) activity (which include rights issues and second public offering) took place in South Africa, representing 65 per cent and 86 per cent of total FO volume and value, respectively.
 
Kenyan FO activity stalled in 2017 with no further offers on the NSE, potentially attributable to the tense environment that developed subsequent to elections held during the year.
 
During the period, Kenya was only able to raise a total of Sh31.8 billion from five offers, with two raising Sh4.6 billion in 2014, and three raising Sh27.2 billion in 2016.
But in 2016. KenGen FO was among the top 10 FOs of that year after raising Sh26.2 billion.

“Our aim is to ensure that Tanzanians benefit from a whole value chain of the agriculture,” Mr Isare stated in Dar es Salaam.
 
The company will focus on crops that have high demand within the country, including maize, sunflower and rice as well as investing in modern farm equipment such as tractors.





“Support us in this new endeavour so that we can prove that we really want to transform agriculture in the country,” Mr Isare assured.

The launching of the shares under the IPO came after the Stock Exchange (DSE) temporarily suspended Jatu from trading for two months to pave the way for issuing an (IPO).

“It’s self-defeating if the shares would still be trading in the secondary market” while others are in the primary market, Mr Muhingo told Daily News yesterday.
 
Jatu, the agri-based firm share was trading 1,200/- before the suspension on Tuesday against 420/- during listing late last November.
 
Vertex International Securities Ahmed Nganya seconded Mr Muhingo said the “temporary suspension was to allow for the IPO of new Jatu shares that take place” between 1st June and 15 July.
DSE said in a statement that the suspension following the guidance from Capital Markets and Securities Authority (CMSA) necessitate the harmonization of Jatu’s corporation actions.
The statement said all shares, following the share split for existing shares together with new shares subscribed during the IPO, will be credited electronically and deposited in the Central Depository System on July 29th to enable secondary trading.

The telecom sought to raise Sh27.6 billion from the sale of 4.47 billion shares as part of the Uganda government’s push to spur local ownership in the industry.
 
The IPO, which was opened to East African investors –from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi— raised Sh16.94 billion (Ush535.9 billion).
 





 
Kenya’s National Social Security Fund (NSSF) bought 39.1 million shares in the Ugandan unit of South African-owned MTN for a 0.18 stake, securing sixth place among the top ten shareholders.
 
South Africa’s MTN Group was selling a fifth of its stake in its Ugandan subsidiary at a price of Ush 200 or Sh6.2 apiece.
 
To motivate investors, the telco offered free shares of between five and 10 units for every 100 units allocated. It required applications for the purchase of at least 1.1 billion shares. 
 
The incentive shares are rare for an IPO in the regional market and signalled MTN’s determination to ensure the offer was successful.
 
The IPO had been tipped to be Uganda’s biggest ever and seen as a major boost to its stock market, a small bourse with 40,000 investors trading just 17 stocks.
 
The shares will start trading on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) on December 7.
 
The listing will make MTN Uganda the second publicly traded telco in EAC after Safaricom IPO on the NSE in 2008.
 
Kenyan investment bank Dyer and Blair, owned by billionaire businessman Jimnah Mbaru, was the lead retail broker for the MTN IPO."

Investors can apply for shares through SBG Securities, a subsidiary of South Africa's Stanbic Holdings Plc and Dyer and Blair which is the lead retail broker.

Winding up the debate on the Sh31,7 trillion budget for the Financial Year 2017/18 in Parliament yesterday, the Finance and Planning Minister, Dr Philip Mpango informed the House that the government would amend the Electronic and Postal Communications Act (Epoca) 2010 with a view to allowing investors across the East African Community member states, Tanzanians in diaspora and foreign investors to take part in pending IPOs for telecommunications firms, including those for Airtel Tanzania and Tigo.
 
Going by Epoca 2010, telecommunication firms are required to offload 25 percent of their shares for the public through the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE).

In this regard, Vodacom Tanzania became the first telecommunications firm to issue an IPO early this year in which it sought to raise Sh476 billion by selling 560 million shares at Sh850 each.
 
With capital controls, however, the IPO was only open to local investors and so far, the company has been unable to reveal the IPO results, with pundits speculating that it might have underperformed due to a tight liquidity in the economy.
 
The Vodacom Tanzania PLC’s IPO ended on May 11 and subsequent listing was scheduled for June 12 but it has remained silent — including on revealing the IPO outcomes — since then, causing anxiety among some of its new investors.
 
The company’s MD, Mr Ian Ferrao, told The Citizen on Monday that Vodacom was only awaiting regulatory approvals from capital markets authorities to go ahead with listing after a total of 40,000 new investors bought shares.
 
But speaking after eight Cabinet ministers and his deputy, Dr Ashatu Kijaji responded to some other issues as raised by MPs during the six days of the budget debate, Dr Mpango, said the government is amending the Epoca 2010 — probably through the Finance Bills 2017 — so as to allow more investors to take part in telecommunication firms’ IPOs.
 
“If a company that will have issued an IPO and fails to raise the required amount, the relevant ministry will come up with a modality that will guide it (the company) on how to raise the entire money as required by the law,” he said."

The company could raise the number of offered shares in the private placement based on the coverage ratio of not over 26.1%.





Last Sunday, e-finance announced it set the indicative price for its IPO on the EGX at a range between EGP 12.5 and EGP 13.98 per share.
 
The offering comprises a sell-down of 80 million secondary shares and a capital increase of 177.777 million primary shares, both account for 14.5% of the group’s share capital.

The IPO comes after a six-year drought since Umeme (UMEM) listed on the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) in 2012.
It will bring the number of locally listed companies on USE to nine. Currently, USE has eight locally listed stocks and eight cross-listed companies – all from Kenya.
The company, according to the prospectus that has been sent to the Capital Markets Authority for approval, hopes to put on offer more than 657 million shares, through which the public will own a share of Uganda’s largest pharmaceutical firm.
Renaissance Capital will be the lead transaction advisor while Crested Capital will be the lead sponsor for the IPO that is expected to mobilise at least Shs100b, according to sources familiar with the process.

Cipla Quality Chemicals, according to the prospectus, is currently conducting a book building process that will inform its final figures and decision.
The company is currently owned by a consortium of investors. At 62.3 per cent, Meditab Holdings holds the largest stake.
The Indian drug maker and biotechnology company, which sells under the Cipla trading name hopes to hold 51 per cent after the IPO.
Other shareholders include Capitalworks Investment Partners (14.4 per cent), TLG Capital, which intends to sell part of its 12.50 per cent stake and Mr Emmanuel Katongole, who holds 3.6 per cent.
Mr Katongole, the Cipla Quality Chemicals chairman and a founding director, hopes to reduce his shareholding to 1.80 per cent after the IPO.
Mr Frederick Mutebi Kitaka and Mr George Baguma are also expected to reduce their respective shareholding from the 3.6 per cent they currently hold. Mr Katongole yesterday told Daily Monitor they will begin discussing particulars of the intended IPO on Monday, declaiming to divulge into details.
In 2004, Quality Chemicals partnered with Cipla and the government of Uganda to form a joint venture that would later establish one of the largest pharmaceutical industries in East Africa.
The government of Uganda in 2010 divested from the drug manufacturer, selling its stake to Cipla Quality Chemicals at a transaction that was valued at about $5m (Shs18.7b).
Mr Keith Kalyegira, the Capital Market Authority chief executive officer, yesterday said the IPO indicates growing confidence in Uganda’s equity markets, which has afforded the public to own a share of some of Uganda prime companies.
“The more people believe the more we shall see investor participate. It is a very strong confidence move that [Cipla Quality Chemicals] has taken,” he said.
Companies, he said, are increasingly finding relevant to mobilise cheap resources through the stock exchange instead of resorting to banks, whose interest rates are increasingly becoming volatile.

The news which was published in specialized U.S. media, quotes anonymous sources close to the case. It however does not give any detail on the volume of shares to be offered, nor on the IPO’s terms. What is known however is that the firm is in talks with investment banks to handle the subscriptions of investors that will be interested in the operation when the time comes.

Vivo Energy was established in 2011, after Shell sold 80% of its oil products distribution assets in 14 African countries to Vitol SA and Helios Investment Partners (Private equity firm focused on Africa) for one billion dollar.
 
At the beginning of 2017, it was revealed that the Anglo-Dutch group had sold Vivo’s remaining 20% stake for $250 million.

Mr Raphael Masumbuko – the chief executive officer of Zan Securities Limited, who are providing advisory services to Maxcom – told The Citizen that they were seriously considering February this year as the month in which to launch the company’s initial public offering (IPO).
 
“We’re considering February as the right time to open the IPO because the economy of the country (Tanzania) will be stable –and members of the public would have already finished dealing with their January financial obligations,” he said, referring to the myriad expenses that are usually associated with the month of January such as rent, school fees, etc.
 
“Although it’s not mandatory for Maxcom to launch an IPO, we nonetheless consider February to be the perfect time in which to start an IPO. We expect the company to be listed on the local bourse (DSE) by February or March this year,” the Zan Securities chief stated.

Mr Masumbuko further explained that, apart from Maxcom, several companies have shown interest in listing on the DSE. However, he would not divulge their names or other details, ostensibly because “they were not yet ready for that kind of publicity.”
 
Currently, Maxcom operates in six African countries, namely Tanzania – which hosts the firm’s headquarters – Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and Burundi.
 
The firm’s board chairman, Prof Samwel Wangwe of Tanzania, recently said that the listing would enable the company to freely operate in compliance with the country’s laws and regulations.
 
According to the chairman, the application to go public was aimed at conforming with Tanzania’s Electronic and Postal Communication Act of 2010, and the Finance Act (2016), which requires communications operators to offload a minimum of 25 per cent of their shares on the general public.
 
June last year, Tanzania President John Pombe Magufuli ordered the revocation of operation licences for mobile telephony companies which were not willing, able or ready to list with DSE.
 
In the event, Dr Magufuli directed the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) to act tough against stubborn companies – emphasizing that all mobile phone firms operating in the country were required to float shares on the bourse.
 
Maxcom chairman Wangwe said implementation of the president’s directive would improve the company’s efficiency.
 
In that regard, the good professor stressed that he would strive throughout his term to efficaciously manage the company, and expand its activities within and beyond the country’s borders.
 
“Listing at the DSE will enhance” all that, Prof Wangwe confidently stated."

The Egyptian government launched in 2016 an IPO program that offers shares in several state-owned companies over three to five years in fields such as petroleum, services, chemicals and real estate to help boost state finances.
 
The Initial Public Offerings (IPO) program is conducted under the supervision of the Ministry of Investment.
 
It covers a period of three to five years, aiming to offer partial stakes in some state-owned companies on the Stock Exchange. It will serve as a main tool to attract local and foreign capital flows to Egypt."

In a statement issued last Friday, the bank said over 12 500 applications were received from local and one international investor(s), to the value N$1,4 billion.
 
The initial public offer was for 81 million shares, however, investors demanded 160 million shares, leading to an oversubscription of almost twice the public offer.
 
The 81 million shares offer raised N$722,2 million.





Retail applicants, including individuals, rendered 12 478 applications and they will all be considered, the bank said.
 
Institutional investors including pension funds and investment companies made 45 applications to the value of N$1,1 billion, an indication that the market is indeed flooded with money looking for investments.
 
Only one international investor was attracted to the Standard Bank offer, making an application worth N$70 million.
 
While all the retail applicants would be allocated a stake in the bank, only 41,58% of N$1 billion worth of applications rendered by institutional investors will be accepted and 20% of the N$70 million from the international investor will be considered.
 
The rejection of part of the Namibian institutional investors and the international investor will result in at least N$700 million that should look for investments elsewhere.
 
Vetumbuavi Mungunda, the bank's chief executive officer, had said although it was an odd time to list, the bank is going to operate for the long term and for that reason he said what the economy was going through now is just a cycle.
 
From the turnout, it appears investors were convinced by his talk amid the bank's high dependency on the property market, an alarmingly high non-performing loan ration, minimal digitisation and them not being engaged in the micro-lending market. This seemed not to ward off investors.
 
One would say the interest rested in the bank's loan book growth in these difficult times, a better earnings per share and solid parent company, Standard Bank SA.
 
The Namibian has reported that the market is flooded with too much money looking for investments, and the over-subscription of Standard Bank's shares confirms this.
 
According to PSG Wealth Namibia's analysis of the public offer results, the offer was oversubscribed 1,98 times.
 
Following the conclusion of the allocation from the public offer, Standard Bank is expected to list on the main board of the Namibian Stock Exchange (NSX) with a free float of 25,1%.
 
The NSX has approved the listing of all the issued ordinary shares of SBN Holdings (SNO), from 09h00 on Friday, 15 November 2019.
 
According to the public offering prospectus, the main purpose of the public offer was to allow selected applicants and members of the public to participate directly in the equity growth and income streams of SBN Holdings.
 
The public offer was also to allow Standard Bank to broaden Namibian ownership in the group, broaden Namibian previously disadvantaged individual's ownership in the group and to provide the liquidity mechanism to unlock value for the Purros Scheme (an employee share trust).
 
There are, however, talks that shareholders in the Purros Scheme might sell their shares after 31 December 2019."

The prospectus reveals that the firm plans to sell an 18% stake in the company, which will be increased to 20% within 24 months after the initial public offering. The company’s board and shareholders agreed to tender 657,179,319 of the company’s 3,651,909,200 shares. With the firm’s authorised share capital currently at Shs45,648,865,000, it means that the issued shares are valued at Shs3,651,909,200 or Shs12.5 per share.
 
Emmanuel Katongole, the company’s executive chairman, said the offer “is a sale of shares by the selling shareholders” and is not aimed at raising capital. “The Company is well capitalised, is cash generative and has sufficient resources to self-fund its growth and, as such, does not anticipate the need to raise any primary capital at this time,” Mr Katongole said in a statement published in the prospectus.

The offer shares will comprise shares offered by Cipla EU, a United Kingdom subsidiary of Cipla Ltd, Capitalworks, a South African private equity firm, the three Ugandan founders, and Amistad, a Mauritius-registered company controlled by TLG Capital. Cipla EU is to sell all its shares, currently 11.25% of the company’s issued shares, while Capitalworks will see its stake reduce to 11.11% from the current 14.4%. Amistad’s stake will reduce by 1% to 11.50% after the offer.
 
The three Ugandan founders – Emmanuel Katongole, George Baguma, and Frederick Mutebi Kitaka – will each own 2.78% after the offer, from the current 3.60% each. Only Mediatab, a Mauritius-registered company wholly owned by Cipla Ltd, will retain the same stake, 51.05%, it currently owns after the initial public offering.
 
A preliminary prospectus is filed by a firm with the securities industry regulator before its initial public offering and is “intended to provide pertinent information to prospective shareholders about the company’s business, managers, strategic initiatives, financial statements, and ownership structure.”
 
The document is issued before the offering price is determined by the underwriter. The price will be determined after the book building process – in which the underwriter tries to determine the IPO price based on the demand of the shares from institutional investors – and will be included in the final prospectus, which is expected to be published on 10 August.
 
According to the preliminary prospectus, the book building for Cipla Quality Chemicals opened on 26 July and will close on 9 August. The IPO will open to retail investors on 13 August, allowing them to take part in the offer, and will close on 24 August. The company expects to be admitted to listing and trading on the USE on 24 September.
 
The Kenyan subsidiary of Renaissance Capital, the investment bank, is the lead advisor on the transaction as well as the sole underwriter, while Bowmans (AF Mpanga Advocates) was retained as legal counsel.
 
Other advisors are Ernst & Young Limited as reporting accountants, Standard Chartered Bank as the receiving bank, and C&R Group as registrar of the company. Crested Capital is the transaction’s lead sponsoring broker.
 
However, as is spelt out in the prospectus, those dates could be amended and extended if Cipla Quality Chemicals, the Uganda Securities Exchange, and the Capital Markets Authority agree."

Vodacom offered 560,000,100 ordinary shares at a price of 850/- in the country’s biggest share sale opened from March to July after the government ordered all telecommunications companies in the country to sell at least a 25 per cent stake on the Dar es Salaam exchange to boost domestic ownership.
 
“We look forward to the public investors becoming our shareholders and to the listing of our company, and to be part of our company’s vision to lead Tanzania into the digital age and change lives through technology.”
 
It was expected once completed, the IPO will boost the bourse’s capitalisation by at least 2.4 per cent to about 20.7tri/-. This is a significant landmark transaction for the country, being the largest IPO in the history of Tanzania’s capital markets and has attracted more than 40,000 Tanzanian investors, most of whom are first time participants in the capital markets in Tanzania.
 
The CMSA has approved the shareholders’ register reflecting these results, ready for crediting the allotted shares to the respective shareholders’ Central Securities Depository (CSD) accounts.
 
In accordance with the IPO timetable approved by the CMSA and included in the Addendum to the Vodacom Tanzania Prospectus, 7th August, 2017 was the official announcement date of the results of the IPO.
 
According to the statement, following completion of the CSD Accounts postings, Vodacom Tanzania shares will be listed on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) on 15th August, 2017 under the ticker “VODA” and trading in the Vodacom shares shall commence on the same day."

MTN commenced moves to list on the Ghana Stock Exchange, GSE, in 2016, as part of conditions under which it secured the 4G license in late 2015.
 
It was expected to finalize processes to float shares on the GSE by 2017.
 
In an exclusive interview with JoyBusiness, Managing Director of the Ghana Stock Exchange, Kofi Yamoah indicated that the company has submitted all the necessary documents and awaiting approval from the regulatory bodies before going public.

He said, “They’ve submitted the necessary documents to the GSE for review. We believe that at the end of the first quarter, we’ll see the public offer for that entity taking off.”
 
Mr Yamoah described the move as one of the significant activities to occur before the end of the first quarter of 2018.
 
Last year, the CEO of MTN Ghana, Ebenezer Asante, explained that the move to sell part of the company’s shares to Ghanaians is part of the localization that came with the 4G license.
 
“It’s very clear from the license that 35% of MTN should be moved into Ghanaian hands and since we required the license we have engaged the regulators both in the NCA as well as the Central Bank and also with the Securities and Exchange Commission,” he said.
 
This is said to impact positively on trading in the Ghanaian market.
 
In all 42 corporate notes and bonds were listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange with a value of Ghc6709 million by the end of December 2017 as against 23 with a value of Ghc444 million in 2016.
 
Launched in 1994, the MTN Group is a leading emerging market operator, connecting subscribers in 22 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
 
The MTN Group is listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in South Africa under the share code: “MTN.” As of 30 June 2013, MTN recorded 201.5 million subscribers across its operations in Afghanistan, Benin, Botswana, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Cyprus, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Guinea Republic, Iran, Liberia, Nigeria, Republic of Congo (Congo Brazzaville), Rwanda, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Swaziland, Syria, Uganda, Yemen and Zambia."

The group is required to float shares on the local stock exchange under an agreement with Ghanaian authorities for access to 4G spectrum licence in the 800MHz band, which was granted to it in late 2015. In terms of that deal, MTN must sell up to 35% of its shares.

MTN will sell about 4.63 billion shares in MTN Ghana at 0.75 cedis per share, in what is expected to be the West African country’s largest IPO.
 
“The minimum amount to be raised for the offer to be deemed successful and for the listing to proceed is approximately GHS0.35bn, which represents approximately 10% of the total offer size. Given the objective of targeting a broad base of Ghanaian investors, allocation to non-Ghanaian investors is to be restricted to 5% of the issued shares of MTN Ghana.”, the group said.
 
Brokerage firm IC Securities is lead adviser for the transaction. If successful, MTN Ghana will be the most valuable company and the first mobile operator to be listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange.
 
MTN is the leading mobile operator in Ghana with 17.8 million voice subscribers as of September, ahead of AirtelTigo, Vodafone and Nigeria’s Globacom."
32,Nigeria’s IROKO to file for IPO on London Stock Exchange,https://www.african-markets.com/en/news/west-africa/nigeria/nigeria-s-iroko-to-file-for-ipo-on-london-stock-exchange," February 10, 2021 6:06 PM",2022-07-20 16:57:25.722858,"Nigerian-based media company, IROKO plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market in 2022.
 
Founded in 2011 by Jason Njoku and Bastian Gotter, Iroko is one of Africa’s first mainstream online movie streaming websites, and it has the world’s largest online catalog of Nollywood films.
 
According to TheAfricaReport, the media company will raise between $20 million and $30 million valuing the company at $80 million to $100 million. Discussions with brokers will start in the coming weeks. Njoku holds a stake of 18% in the debt-free company.





In 2020, Irokotv planned to increase its average revenue per user in Africa from $7-8 to $20-25. It seemed the company was set to achieve that until the pandemic came. Consumer spending in Nigeria and other African markets reduced and subscriptions dropped by 70% but international subscribers grew by 200% during the lockdown hitting a $25-30 ARPU range.
 
Jason Njoku told TechCrunch that, “The costs of pursuing Africa growth is what was really resized dramatically. We were so focused on defending Africa and basically ended up doing nothing. Zero marketing or anything to drive that.
 
“We pulled back to focus on where our economics actually makes sense. Our international business organically grew double-digit in 2020 and we expect it to continue this way for the foreseeable future.”
 
Why London Stock Exchange?

IROKO makes 80% of its revenue outside Africa and listing on a foreign exchange will help consolidate its efforts. According to Njoku, the Nigerian Stock Exchange or other local exchanges do not have a history of listing early-stage tech companies; therefore, the London Stock Exchange makes more sense in the short term.
The company is focusing more on international subscribers primarily in the U.S and the U.K where it has been able to execute a 150% price increase from $25 per year to $60 per year without any negative impact.
The company is seeking a market cap of about $100 million, which is small for the primary market. This is why it is choosing to list on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the LSE. A sub-market of the LSE, the AIM is built specifically for small-cap companies.

 
IROKO secured around $30 million in total during its Series E funding in January 2016 and it plans to raise less or a similar amount when going public in 2022.
 
The only company to have gone public from Nigeria is Jumia. Interswitch, a payment processing company valued at $1 billion is also planning to go public in the next 2 years."

The first quarter (1Q) of this year will witness two offerings, one from the public sector and the other from the private sector. The first of which is Macro Group for Pharmaceuticals, which is expected to be offered in February, the second is the IPO of the state-owned football company, Ghazl El-Mahalla SC.
 
Mohamed Omran, the Chairperson of the Financial Regulatory Authority, expected the shares of Macro Group for Pharmaceuticals to debut on the stock exchange (EGX) this month.
 
He added that the list of propositions includes the offering of Ghazl El-Mahalla SC Company, which will be its first time under the public subscription system. “There is also another company which is currently communicating with the authority to complete its offering on the EGX under the public subscription system during the coming period,” he revealed.
 





 
Omran expects that 2022 will witness a large number of IPOs.
 
“Companies affiliated with the Egyptian Armed Forces are expected to be offered this year, in addition to the government IPO programme and the private sector’s offerings.
 
Mohamed Maher, the CEO of Prime Holding — which is responsible for the offering — said that the procedures for offering Ghazl El-Mahalla SC on the EGX are expected to be completed by the end of February or March at the latest. He added that the IPO will be incorporated as a new company with an initial capital of EGP 200m. 
 
The remaining unissued capital in the offered shares will come in the form of an in-kind contribution from the Misr Spinning and Weaving Company.
 
Moreover, sources closely related to the offering of the Ebtikar for financial services said that the company’s IPO is expected after the Eid Al-Fitr holiday (in May), as an agreement is currently underway with an independent financial adviser to prepare fair value studies. 
 
Also, the company is awaiting the approval of the relevant authorities regarding the implementation of the Vodafone deal, which completed its due diligence checks.
 
Among the private sector companies expected to be listed on the Egyptian Exchange during the second half (2H) of 2022 is Abu Auf.
 
Also, sources told Daily News Egypt that the government IPO programme will witness the offering of three other state-owned companies’ shares in the EGX before the end of the current fiscal year. The government IPO programme resumed with the e-finance IPO in 2021, following a long hiatus after selling a secondary stake in the Eastern Company in March 2019. 
 




 
Besides Ghazl El-Mahalla SC, Banque du Caire is the most prominent of these IPOs, and it is expected to be completed during 2H of 2022.
 
It is worth noting that Qalaa Holding has announced the postponement of the listing of TAQA Arabia on the EGX again to 2023 when market conditions are expected to improve.
 
TAQA Arabia was supposed to debut in 2020, however, the company postponed the offering to 2021 and then decided last week to postpone it again till next year.
 
Followers of the Egyptian financial markets have always wondered when can Egypt catch up with global financial markets in terms of the number and sizes of IPOs.
 
Recently, Arab stock exchanges have witnessed more IPOs compared to EGX; after a disappointing year for Egyptian IPOs, dealers are waiting for a new year with better investment opportunities.
 
The EGX only witnessed 3 offerings in 2021 with a value of EGP 7.95bn, including two companies in the main market and another in the small projects market, with little growth compared to 2020, which witnessed 1 offering of EGP 200m.
 
Last year, the EGX witnessed the offering of e-finance, which debuted with 1.6bn shares with a value of EGP 5.84bn, along with Taaleem Management Services with 730.3m shares with a value of EGP 2.1bn. While the IPO of Emerald for Development and Project Management in the SMEs market with 425m shares worth EGP 57.6m. 
 
Emerald Real Estate Investment Company was also offered on the Nile Stock Exchange with a value of EGP 200m.
 
Looking over the past year, global IPOs witnessed their best performance in 20 years, with 2,388 deals worth $453.3bn, according to data released by Ernst & Young, increasing deals by 64% year-on-year (y-o-y). Issuance revenue also jumped by 67% y-o-y.
 
The US continued to dominate the global IPO markets, as it acquired about 80% of all deals in the Americas region, which contributed to an increase in the number of regional deals by 87% y-o-y to 528 deals, while the value of issuances amounted to $174.6bn."

CSMA principal public relations officer Charles Shirima confirmed that Halotel the company submitted its prospectus late last year.
 
Halotel is among telecommunications companies that are yet to float 25 per cent of their shares through an initial public offering at DSE in accordance with the Electronic and Postal Communication Act (2010).
 
“We returned the prospectus to Halotel because it lacked some regulatory requirements. After we finalise working on it, the company shares will be floated at the market,” he said.

If the prospectus is approved by CMSA, Halotel Tanzania, which is owned by the Vietnamese government, will be the second to float an IPO behind Vodacom Tanzania, which was listed last year.
 
The quarterly communications statistics report of 2017, shows that Halotel had the lowest tariffs on SMS both locally and internationally, charging Sh30 and Sh95 respectively. Halotel had 3.7 million voice subscribers as of September, last year, which was 9 per cent of the mobile telecom market share.
 
According to the report, 442,512 people subscribed for Halotel mobile money, which made two per cent of total mobile money subscription. Recently, organisers of the International Business Awards (Steve Awards 2017) named Viettel Tanzania PLC, which trades as Halotel Tanzania, as the fastest-growing enterprise in Africa and the Middle East. For the past two years, Halotel Tanzania has managed to register 3.5 million customers, ranking fourth among eight telecoms operating in Tanzania. The firm overtook some mobile operators that have existed longer. Halotel was launched in October 2015 and deployed in all 26 Tanzanian regions. This was Viettel’s fourth investment in Africa after Movitel, Lumitel and Nexttel in Mozambique, Burundi and Cameroon respectively. Viettel started investing in the country in 2011 and planned $736 million in investment after then-President Jakaya Kikwete visited Vietnam.
 
The entry of Viettel also saw further liberalisation of the communication sector, with the government allowing private companies to lay their own optic fibre cables. The company had promised to connect several public institutions around the country with the optic fibre network and connect over 1,500 villages to the telecommunications grid that were previously not served. The company also tried to partner with state-owned energy company Tanzania Electric Supply Company to use the utility firm’s power poles to serve as antennas."

The telecom, a South African MTN Group subsidiary, said Tuesday that it had received regulatory approvals to list 20 percent of its shareholding.
 
The firm said Tuesday that it would disclose details of the offer in its prospectus to be released on October 11.
 
Uganda’s Capital Markets Authority (CMA) Chief Executive Keith Kalyegira said the IPO is expected to raise about $1.2 billion.





“The intention to float announcement is a major step towards delivering on our plan to list on the USE,” MTN Uganda chairman Charles Mbire told reporters.
 
The widely anticipated stake sale of the leading telecom in Uganda will be restricted to citizens of the East African Community trading bloc, Ugandan regulators said earlier.
 
Besides Kenya and Uganda, the other members of the EAC are Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.
 
The IPO is expected to boost the number of retail investors at the Uganda Securities Exchange from about 40,000 to 200,000 investors.
 
The listing will make MTN Uganda the second publicly traded telecom in EAC after Safaricom’s IPO on the Nairobi Securities Exchange in 2008.
 
“This will potentially be the largest IPO on the Ugandan market and will be delivered primarily through a digital paperless/ green platform which is the first of its kind in East Africa,” said MTN Uganda in a statement.
 
 
Licence condition
“The offer and listing of MTN Uganda is in line with MTN Group’s localisation plans to drive local ownership in the markets within which MTN operates,” the firm said.
 
The Ugandan government set the listing of telecoms on the local bourse as one of its licence renewal conditions to allow local ownership of big companies with few large shareholders.
 
MTN Group Ltd of South Africa owns more than 90 percent of the company’s shares, while a Ugandan businessman holds less than five percent shares. 
 
MTN Uganda, which has 15 million subscribers, had its operating licence renewed for 12 years in February last year after paying $100 million with the local listing requirement as a precondition for the permit nod.
 
“We are delighted to witness the honouring of this commitment by MTN,” said Irene Kaggwa-Sewankambo, the Executive Director of the Uganda Communications Commission.
 
MTN Uganda was granted two years starting July 1 2020, to list 20 percent of its equity on the Ugandan Securities Exchange.
 
“This IPO gives Ugandans an opportunity to own a piece of the company,” said USE chief executive Paul Bwiso on Tuesday.
 
MTN Uganda started operating in the country in 1998.
 
Although relatively small, Uganda’s telecoms and data market is seen as potentially lucrative because many of the country’s 42 million people are young.
 
Mobile penetration in Uganda grew from 0.27 percent in 1998 to 67 percent as of March 2021 underlining the sector's rapid growth."

Last week Egypt said it was gearing up to implement the second wave of IPOs in September.





E-finance, which operates the government's financial network with a paid capital of EGP 500 million, will be the second company to be sold in an IPO after Banque du Caire.
 
Banque du Caire will offer a stake of its shares, ranging between 30 and 40 percent, which is expected to garner between $300 million and $400 million, CBE Governor Tarek Amer said in previous statements.
 
In 2016, Egypt announced the launch of the IPO programme by offering a portion of shares in state-owned companies on the EGX to revive the market as part of the country's economic reform programme.
 
The IPO programme aims to attract investments to the domestic market and make ultimate use of state assets.
 
The programme is scheduled to be fully implemented within three to five years over 23 companies and banks in various sectors, including real estate, services, petroleum, and chemicals, targeting to collect approximately EGP 8 billion, according to the initial statement of the fiscal year 2019/20 budget.

Millions have already been raised in this historic Initial Product Offering (IPO), with people across Namibia showing incredible appetite to invest in Letshego Namibia shares.
 
Letshego Namibia’s story is about empowerment, via the solutions it provides, and now via Ekwafo Letu, as it offers 20 percent of the company’s shares for sale to the Namibian public.
 
Letshego believes that to be totally financially inclusive, it should offer Namibians the opportunity to be part of its growth. As Letshego grows, so shall ordinary Namibians’ wealth.
 
Letshego Namibia CEO, Ester Kali: “This is a platform for financial inclusion, and our objective from the onset was to ensure maximum citizen participation in this great opportunity for empowerment.

“This is with a particular focus on previously disadvantaged Namibians. The reception by Namibians has been strong, and we look forward to welcoming a great many new shareholders in this proudly Namibian business. This is our time. This is Ekwafo Letu.”
 
The opportunity for Namibians to buy shares is limited – the last day they can submit their offers to purchase Letshego Namibia shares is Friday, September 22.
 
The total value of the shares offered to the public is about N$470 million. When Kali first announced the floating of shares , she said it was done to ensure maximum public participation and ownership of the Letshego shares with priority for citizens.
 
She said citizen empowerment and potential for financial gain through share value growth and dividends are some of the benefits that could be gained through this opportunity.
 
“This is also an opportunity for us to raise the profile of Letshego in Namibia among members of the general public, investors and target markets within Namibia, and to accelerate the rate of economic growth by stimulating entrepreneurship and investment,” she stated.
 
LHN opened its doors in 2002 as Edu-Loan Namibia, providing consumer and micro-lending services. In August 2008, Letshego Holdings Limited, a Botswana Stock Exchange-listed entity, acquired 100 per cent of the company, soon after which the company re-branded to Letshego Financial Services Namibia.
 
Currently, the Botswana Stock Exchange-listed entity owns 65 per cent of shares in Letshego Namibia, whilst 15 per cent is retained by Kumwe Investments Holding.
 
The Bank of Namibia has given the foreign-owned bank until the 2020 to comply with requirements that locals should hold at least 40 percent equity in commercial lenders operating in the country. An individual will only be allowed to buy a minimum number of 200 shares, which means the least amount they can offer is N$940."
