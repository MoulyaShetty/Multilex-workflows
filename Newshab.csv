The company's enthusiasm for listing on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) is still high. So far, there have been 26 new issuers that have completed their initial public offering (IPO) in 2022. The fates of these newcomers are different. There are those whose share prices soared up to 1,500%, but there are also those who languish until they are stuck at the gocap level. PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia Tbk (ADMR) has been phenomenal with price spikes that have so far held at the level of 1.580%. ADMR shares were able to rise 10.89% on Tuesday (19/7) to a price of Rp 1,680. The surge in the price of PT WIR Asia Tbk (WIRG) was no less astonishing in the early days of the IPO.

PT Mitra Angkasa Sejahtera Tbk (BAUT) accompanied the list of issuers with a share price of Rp 50. PT Nanotech Indonesia Global Tbk (NANO) and PT Winner Nusantara Jaya Tbk (WINR) almost followed. The share prices of NANO and WINR are compact in the area of ​​Rp 52. Although they are still far from the gocap level, a number of stocks tend to stagnate and even have a flushing trend, such as PT Adhi Commuter Properti Tbk (ADCP) and PT Semacom Integrated Tbk (SEMA). Sucor Sekuritas analyst Paulus Jimmy highlighted that the company's fundamentals and valuation are crucial factors when trading on the stock market. But there is another important thing that should not be forgotten, namely the story. Story is considered important because it relates to public interest in understanding the issuer's profile, strategy, and business prospects in the future. Therefore, Jimmy believes that not all issuers whose prices fell after the IPO have poor fundamentals and valuations. ""It could be because of the low interest of investors in the stories from these issuers. It should be understood that the story of every industry has a cycle. What is not interesting today, tomorrow could be interesting,"" said Jimmy when contacted by Kontan.co.id, Tuesday (19/7). ). Technical Analyst Binaartha Sekuritas Ivan Rosanova added that sectoral sentiment could also influence the direction of stocks after the IPO. It could be that market players relinquish ownership after the IPO because they are looking at other stocks that are considered more attractive for now. Also Read: After the IPO, Chemstar (CHEM) Expands the Market to the Cosmetics and F&B Segment. Vice versa with stocks whose prices are already burning. Considering the recent market fluctuations, in the short term there is a chance for a correction to occur. But as long as the issuer's performance and business prospects are still positive, investors tend to accumulate rather than profit taking, so the price is relatively maintained. Even so, Ivan reminded him to be careful when entering into new stocks whose prices have soared considerably. ""It's better to wait for the release of the performance, especially if the valuation is quite high, especially for stocks that have not experienced a significant correction,"" said Ivan. In the midst of a market trend that is prone to selling pressure, Ivan suggested that the portion of the investment portfolio is also directed to bigcap stocks. For now, it's best not to be aggressive while observing market developments. ""Take advantage of every rebound to get short-term profits while slowly filling the portfolio with selected stocks,"" said Ivan. Jimmy had a similar record. Jimmy suggested that investors should pay attention to market conditions which tend to be volatile this year, so don't be too aggressive towards IPO shares if you don't understand the fundamental conditions. Associate Director of Research and Investment Pilarmas Investindo Sekuritas Maximilianus Nico Demus also highlighted the high market interest in IPO shares. The attraction is, the opportunity to gain money is felt to be bigger.

Nico emphasized that this belief must come from careful consideration of the fundamental condition and valuation of the company, as well as the business sector that is inline with the direction of government policies or the global situation. For this year, Nico sees non-cyclical consumers, healthcare, commodities, and energy as still attractive sectors to look at. Meanwhile, MNC Sekuritas Technical Analyst Herditya Wicaksana favors the mining sector, as it is influenced by high commodity prices. ADMR shares can still be collected by observing the support at Rp. 1,455 and resistance at Rp. 1,800. Then, technically there is a chance for SEMA stock to strengthen even in the short term. You can watch the support area at Rp 176 and resistance at Rp 198. Ivan also supports ADMR shares with a target price at Rp 1,850. Furthermore, WIRG shares, which as long as they are still above the psychological level of Rp 500 have the potential to rebound. WIRG targets are at Rp 615 and Rp 680.
